PM Okay PM Right PM Um well this is the kickoff meeting for our our project PM Um and um this is just what were gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes ME Mmhmm PM Um so first of all just to kind of make sure that we all know each other Im Laura and Im the project manager PM Do you want to introduce yourself again ME Great ID Hi Im David and Im supposed to be an industrial designer PM Okay ME And Im Andrew and Im uh our marketing expert UI Um Im Craig and Im User Interface PM Great PM Okay PM Um so were designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record whos here actually PM So thats David Andrew and Craig isnt it PM And you all arrived on time PM Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control PM Um as you can see its supposed to be original trendy and user friendly PM Um so thats kind of our our brief as it were PM Um and so there are three different stages to the design PM Um Im not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails PM What did you get ID Um I just got the project announcement about what the project is PM Mmhmm ID Designing a remote control ME Mmhmm ID Thats about it didnt get anything else ME Mmhmm ME Yeah thats thats it PM Is that what everybody got UI Yeah ID Did you get the same thing PM Okay ME Yeah PM Um PM So were gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it PM And repeat that process three times PM Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there PM Um PM So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it PM So who would like to go first ME I will go ME Thats fine PM Very good ME Alright ME So This one here right PM Mmhmm ME Okay ME Very nice ME Alright ME My favourite animal is like A beagle ME Um charac favourite characteristics of it ME Is that right PM Yeah ME Uh right well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family PM Yeah ME And yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health ME So this is blue ME Blue beagle ME My familys beagle PM Right PM Lovely UI Well my favourite animal would be a monkey UI Then theyre small cute and furry and uh when planet of the apes becomes real Im gonna be up there with them PM Right ID Cool ID Theres too much gear PM You can take as long over this as you like because we havent got an awful lot to discuss PM Ok oh we do we do PM Dont feel like youre in a rush anyway ID Okay ME I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles PM Ach why not We might have to get you up again then ME Boy let me tell you PM I dont know what mine is PM Im gonna have to think on the spot now ME Impressionist ID Cant draw PM Is that a whale ID Um ID Yeah ID Um well anyway I dont know its just the first animal I can think off the top of my head ID Um ID Yes ID Big reason is cause Im allergic to most animals ID Allergic to animal fur so um fish was a natural choice PM Ah ID Um yeah and I kind of like whales ID They come in and go eat everything in sight ID And theyre quite harmless and mild and interesting ME Alright ME Mm PM Okay PM God I still dont know what Im gonna write about PM Um ME Superb sketch by the way ID Tails a bit big I think PM I was gonna choose a dog as well PM But Ill just draw a different kind of dog ME Yep PM M my favourite animal is my own dog at home PM Um That doesnt really look like him actually PM He looks more like a pig actually PM Ah well ME I see a dog in there PM Do you ME Yep PM Oh thats very good of you ME Now I see a rooster PM Uh ME What kind is it PM Um hes a mixture of uh various things PM Um and what do I like about him um Thats just to suggest that his tail wags PM Um hes very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and um uh and hes quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesnt take up too much space PM Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well which is quite amusing so It is ME Is he aware that th its his own cha tail hes chasing PM I think it is PM He only does it after hes had his dinner and um hell just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail round the living room ME Hmm ID Its an after dinner dog then PM Yeah so uh Yeah maybe ME Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned PM Maybe PM Right um where did you find this PM Just down here PM Yeah PM Okay PM Um what are we doing next PM Uh um PM Okay uh we now need to discuss the project finance PM Um so according to the brief um were gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro um and were aiming to make fifty million Euro PM Um so were gonna be selling this on an international scale PM And uh we dont want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros so fifty percent of the selling price ME Kay ME Um can we just go over that again PM Sure ME Uh so bas at twel Alright yeah ME Okay ME So cost like production cost is twelve fifty but selling price is is that wholesale or retail PM All together ME Like on the shelf PM Um I dunno PM I imagine Thats a good question ME Our sale our sale anyway PM I imagine it probably is our sale actually because its probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want ME Yeah okay okay ME Okay ME Mmhmm PM Um ME Alright PM But I I dont know I mean do you think the fact that its going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ME Yes PM Think it will ME Mmhmm PM Um ME Mmhmm PM Hmm ME Well right away Im wondering if theres um th th uh like with DVD players if there are zones PM Oh yeah regions and stuff yeah ME Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters um different uh keypad styles and s symbols PM Yeah PM Okay ID Hmm PM Yeah PM Well for a remote control do you think that will be I suppose its depends on how complicated our remote control is ME Um ME I dont know ME Yeah ID It does make sense from maybe the design point of view cause you have more complicated characters like European languages then you need more buttons PM Yeah yeah ME Yeah ID So possibly ME Yeah PM Okay ME And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price ME Im thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region whereas in another itll be different so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like basic product podi positioning the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London might not be such a big hit in Greece who knows something like that yeah PM What just like in terms of like the wealth of the country PM Like how much money people have to spend on things like PM Aye I see what you mean yeah PM Marketing PM Good marketing thoughts ME Yep PM Oh gosh I should be writing all this down PM Um ME Right away Im making some kind of assumptions about what what information were given here thinking kay trendy probably means something other than just basic something other than just standard PM Mm PM Yeah ME Um so Im wondering right away is selling twenty five Euros is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uhhuh PM Yeah yeah PM Like how much does you know a remote control cost PM Well twenty five Euro I mean thats um thats about like eighteen pounds or something isnt it ME Mmhmm PM Or no is it as much as that PM Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds ME Yep ME Yeah Id say so yeah PM Um I dunno Ive never bought a remote control so I dont know how how good a remote control that would get you ME No ME Yeah yeah PM Um PM But yeah I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky ME Mmhmm PM Um right okay PM Let me just scoot on ahead here PM Okay PM Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ME Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah PM Thin No actually PM That would be useful though wouldnt it if you knew like what your money would get you now ID Hmm ME Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME Yeah interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out I just dont think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits PM Yeah yeah ME Its just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something PM Oh ME It just comes along PM Five minutes to end of meeting PM Oh okay PM Were a bit behind ME Do you know what I mean UI Yeah ME Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be well the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy remote controls ID Yeah ME Or another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something UI I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house ME But Right ME Right UI So um for them it was just how many devices control ME Okay so Right so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so PM Yeah PM Right so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know do your your satellite and your regular telly and your VCR and everything ME Yeah yeah ME Yeah ME Well like um maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots ME Theyre gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras MP three players telephones everything agenda PM Mmhmm ME So like I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market such as the lighting in your house or um Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Or even like you know notes about um what you wanna watch PM Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh thats a good idea ME An Yeah PM So extra functionalities ME Like p personally for me at home Ive Ive combined the um the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player ME So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them PM Mmhmm ME So its sort of ironic that that then theyre in there um you know the sound and everything its just one system ME But each ones got its own little part PM Hmm PM Um okay uh Id wel were gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes PM Um Ill just check weve nothing else PM Okay PM Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they dont like about remote controls theyve used what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ID And you keep losing them PM You keep losing them ME Mm PM Okay ID Finding them is really a pain you know ME Mm ID I mean its usually quite small or when you want it right it slipped behind the couch or its kicked under the table ME Mm ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Yeah PM W You get those ones where you can if you like whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep ME Yeah ID You know ME Thats just really good id Yep PM There I mean is that something wed want to include do you think ME Uh sure PM Dunno PM Okay maybe ME I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable ME Actually had a cable between it and the TV and big like buttons that sort of like like on a blender or something PM My goodness ME And um you know when I think about what they are now its better but actually its still kind of I dunno like a massive junky thing on the table PM Still feels quite primitive ME Maybe we could think about how could be more you know streamlined PM Maybe like a touch screen or something ME S Something like that yeah PM Okay ME Or whatever would be technologically reasonable PM Uhhuh okay PM Well I guess thats up to our industrial designer ME Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesnt make it any better but that just the appeal of of not having You know these days theres a r pe things in peoples homes are becoming more and more like chic you know PM It looks better PM Yeah ME Um nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway PM Okay PM Okay UI Uh PM Right well um so just to wrap up the next meetings gonna be in thirty minutes PM So thats about um about ten to twelve by my watch PM Um so inbetween now and then um as the industrial designer youre gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what youre doing there ID Yep PM Um for user interface technical functions I guess thats you know like what weve been talking about what itll actually do PM Um and uh marketing executive youll be just thinking about what it actually what you know what requirements it has to has to fulfil and youll all get instructions emailed to you I guess ME Okay PM Um PM Yeah so its th the functional design stage is next I guess PM And uh and thats the end of the meeting PM So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would so Mmhmm ME Um ME Before we wrap up just to make sure were all on the same page here um do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something right PM Uhhuh yeah ID Mmhmm ME Well um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ME Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features PM Th Okay well just very quickly cause this were supposed to finish now ME I I dont know ME Yep PM Um I guess thats up to us I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it so um you know Yeah ME Yeah sure ME Okay ID I think one factor would be production cost ME Okay yeah ID Because theres a cap there so um depends on how much you can cram into that price ME Okay PM Mmhmm ME Okay ID Um PM Yeah ID I think that thats the main factor PM Okay ME Okay PM Right okay well thats thats the end of the meeting then ME Alright PM Um PM So uh thank you all for coming ID Cool,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal. The project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote.
PM Is that alright now PM Okay PM Sorry PM Okay everybody all set to start the meeting PM Okay weve got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design ME Could you plug me in ME Okay ME Thanks PM All ready to go PM Okay ME Okay PM Um so hopefully youve all been working away and Ive put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder PM Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time PM Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project you know costwise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements um which is the The first one is that um uh the companys decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is PM Nobody uses teletext very much anymore so we dont really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control ME Kay PM Um theyve also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television not the VCR DVD or anything else PM I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then itll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production the time to market ME Okay PM So um were just gonna keep it simple and itll just control the TV PM And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design PM Um Im not entirely sure what the corporate colour is PM It might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere ME And the slogan like the actual written slogan or just to embody the idea of the slogan PM Well thats the thing Im Im not sure um uh th because on the the company website uh what does it say Uh something Yeah I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it cause its quite long ME Bout putting the fashion in electronics ID Mm yeah PM Um or yeah just the idea but Im not sure PM So thats something we can discuss as well PM So those are the three things just not to worry about teletext uh only control the TV and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company PM Um so is everybody okay with any of that or do you want me to recap at all ID Nope were all set PM Right um time for presentations then PM Who would like to go first UI Ill go first ME Sure PM Okay cool UI Alright um can I st steal this from the back of your laptop PM Oh yeah of course yeah UI Uh so this is the technical functions design PM G go on ahead UI Um Right to do the um the design I have Ive had a look online Ive had a look at the homepage which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products PM Mmhmm UI Um Ive had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting UI Um unfortunately were not allowed to talk outside the meeting room so Um having a look at the existing products I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes theres either um a very complicated one thats got lots of buttons lots of colours very confusing you dont know what youre doing ME Right PM Okay UI Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad UI Um theres an example Ill show you at the end um sh show you now UI Uh here um the button there and there PM Alright UI This ones prog UI Sorry UI That ones perg and that ones prog and it doesnt really tell you what it does UI Um not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example UI Um its a very simple one UI Its got only the basic functions mm but um its the same size as the the hard to use one PM Oop UI Uh it looked a bit clunky UI Theyre very big and not very much use for buttons UI Um and its just very hard to access the advanced functions UI Theres theres nothing for instance for a slow motion button UI Um my own preferences I prefer the the clunky one UI Um its very easy to use UI Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls UI Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer or something like tha from the bottom of it UI So now Id like to ask for your preferences UI Um not sure of how long weve got uh Um the clunky one is the one on the right PM Um PM Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most ME Mmhmm PM Just a couple of minutes anyway ME M yeah like a lot of a lot of what Ive um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craigs just gone over ME So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research PM Mmhmm ME But anyway um we might come to that later PM Shall we sh well well stick to kind of your area for now ID Which which is the clunky one the one on left or on the right ID Okay PM Yeah ME Um clunky in what sense like um h heavier ME Larger UI Um I think its supposed to be the same size but um its got much fewer buttons UI Its you know its very spread out and kind of you know I get the idea itd be sort of about this size ME I see so its more just basic PM Looks kind of Yeah ME Right okay ME Yeah UI got very few buttons on it and Um do we have any functions that um wed want on it ME Yeah ME Sure PM Well I think its a valid point PM I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated and that PRT p PROT thing is incredibly confusing PM Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design but yeah you dont want to lose out on you know what it does so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open I think thats a good idea ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM I think its a good idea ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm UI I mean so far Ive got um on and off um switch the channel up and down and put the volume up and down PM Mmhmm PM Uhhuh UI Um theyre just the the very basics you could use for a TV PM Uhhuh and then actual numbers for channels as well yeah UI Okay UI Um you say thats a h a required one or a requested one ME Which was that UI Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing um Um yeah ME Up the numbers or the up down PM God I wou I would say thats required I mean theres no way anybodys gonna buy a remote control these days when if you cant actually individually select channels I mean would anybody disagree with that ME Yeah ME Yeah PM Um what else uh So dont need to worry about teletext dont need to worry about VCR uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about you know like brightness and contrast ME We dont ME No ME Yeah ME Well I think I think es essentially what were doing right now is were categorising ME Were saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area PM Mm ME Is that right ME Is that what were were doing PM Yeah ME Were kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just dont want the product to have UI Um Uh to start with um sort of a bit both um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if theyre possible PM I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice PM Mmhmm PM Okay right PM Well do you wanna maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this ME Yeah ME Yep PM Um so so far just to recap youve got volume and channel control and Right okay UI Theres um on and off um volume and channel and skip to certain channels with the numbers PM Um Mmhmm yeah ME Well one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types so that for the user its very clear what they want to do where they go ME Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible ME For example if we had audio controls those could be something people set up very rarely PM Oka Mmhmm ME Maybe theyre un theyre theyre theyre in a little area but covered up um things like channel and volume um are used all the time so we just have them right out on top um very just very sort of selfexplanatory ME Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip ME And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed ME Something like that PM Okay PM Uh well just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no PM Um uh do you think maybe thats the only kind of uh essential requirements and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that maybe like a mute button that sort of thing ME Yeah PM Any of you anything to add to that at all ID No PM No ID Ill add it later I guess the presentation PM Okay right ME Mmhmm ME Yeah PM Um okay if we can move on to next presentation then please ME Sure PM Um Do you wanna Probably not actually UI Do you want to switch places ME Can this can this pl reach ME Can this plug come across ID No ID No ME No ME So why dont I just pick up and move then PM Yeah ME Here Ill just Why dont I just Mm er can you go up behind me UI Just just switch them ME Kinda This is so This Im all in a knot now PM bit complicated PM Itd be nice if everything was wireless wouldnt it ME Okay PM Right ME Um ME So I can I can say already I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but therell be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things PM Oh like overlap between what you said ME Yeah yeah PM Oh well for all you know that thatll happen ME Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing but may what Ive already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well whats the cumulative effect of what weve taken from your ideas and and mine because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely ME Obviously obviously what youve just told me what youve just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that Ive been So how do I how do I get this up PM Mm hard to know what where your role ends yeah PM Okay ID Um function F eight PM Uh pr yeah press function and F eight yeah ME Okay ME Okay ME Alright ME So F eight ID Function the blue button ID Next to the control on the left ME Oh and F eight ID Yeah PM Mm ID You have to push it together ME Okay ME Mmhmm ID Yep ME Okay I think that thats doing it now ID Nope ID Try that again ME Uh again UI Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose ID Wait ME Okay PM Yeah you wanna Oh oh here we go ME Um okay great ID Yep there we go PM There you go ME Okay ME Just um Before I bring this up what Ill just say is um what Ive what Ive done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that its now becomes a collective thing ME And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding kay what what are our options what should we decide and do you know what I mean so ID Increase that cause we cant see the Thats much better PM Um Okay ME Okay PM Right PM Can you um Right okay ID There you go ME Okay ME Alright ME That would be Okay ME So um does that make sense ME So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities ME Cause certainly theres lots of different information to go through ME So um Im thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer and w you know what they want and what are issues with with um existing products ME Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics ME Um and then as I say uh w wed like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno ID Bouncing on top ME Okay PM Yeah ME Um ME So this is what Ive found here um a lot of this is new to me so well just read through together ME Um users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls ME So they find them ugly ME Most people find them ugly ME Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well well see later the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control such as voice recognition PM Mmhmm ME Okay Im gonna well look at that in a second ME Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls ME So I guess what were looking at here is people want this h technology they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they dont doesnt really appeal to them PM Mmhmm ME So I think what were doing is were trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations you know one is that we want uh something thats hightech but we want it to seem easy ME And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very hightech side we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in peoples hands ME Um frustrations ME They get lost a lot s as it came up in our last meeting ME Um takes time to learn how to use them ME This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls so d it doesnt just look like a big panel kinda like when you you look at you know a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory ME If you want audio if you want visual then you have those ME Um and I will admit I dont know what RSI stands for PM Repetitive strain injury ID Is installing a new remote control something that people Um I think itll be the mid range to the high end market in terms of people ME Uh no that did not come up at all ME Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things ME I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition ME Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control ME So I dunno if thats possible we might consider getting into it ME Um ME And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something thats fashionable and sleek and trendy PM Mmhmm ME Um people uh additionally arent arent liking the appearance of their products so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like ME You know they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics PM Okay PM So want something that looks good and is easy to use big priorities ME Yeah ME Yeah so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craigs i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this PM Okay ME So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology ME You know its like like I find a lot of TVs these days something really like about em is if you wanna just turn em on and off you can but they have little panels where you click and theres just like tons of features you go through PM Mm PM So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together you know ME Yeah PM Thats I think its a good idea ME Yeah ME Thats s thats sort of the um But I Im my hope here is that Im putting out this information so that we can then say okay well how do we collectively move on with it PM Mmhmm ME Um I I havent brought out one specific marketing idea although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that PM Okay PM Mmhmm ME But not let that confine us technologically PM Okay ME So Alright PM Right ME Any um comments on all of that PM Well um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who were gonna be um whos our our target audience our target market ME Thats uh Yeah PM Um so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use but has y is fairly powerful product whatever who do we really want to aim that at ME Okay PM I mean Yeah who wou who would have the money to spend ME Wheres the money maybe ME Yeah PM Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine well I dont Im not really sure how much that will retail at ME And who watches TV ME Mmhmm ME Mm PM But you want its somebody whos not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly I suppose theyre gonna actually go out and buy one ME Mmhmm ME Yeah PM So who do you think were aiming this at ID Cause twenty five Euros for a remote how much is that lo locally in pounds PM Its about sixteen seventeen pounds I think ID Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote PM Yeah okay ME Mmhmm ID Right ID Um so maybe not the high end range but maybe middle middle upish PM Okay ID Kind of ID You know how much ID I dunno I guess you pay what ten ten quid for a remote PM Okay ID Like a simple replacement right PM Yeah ID I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get would you how much would you pay PM Yeah yeah ME Yeah ME This this kinda touches on your comments there David ME These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature ID Yeah ME Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on TV equipment is PM Okay Okay ME Mostly focused around the twenty five age group PM Yeah so do you think were were aiming at a fairly young market then ID Yep ME Sort of young professional kind of PM Yeah okay ME Mmhmm Uh yeah its the Yep UI Um Well did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition PM Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider PM What what do you think Craig UI Sort of the the older group UI Uh f Yeah ME It does it does fit with the market that were sort of identifying in terms of Okay PM N yeah PM I think we are gonna have to narrow it down to say lets target these people and give them what they want and cause you know there needs to be some kind of selling point to it ME Yeah ME Sure ME Sure ME Yeah PM So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition its kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that ME Mmhmm PM So we could say that was our target ID I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because thats more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Yeah yeah PM Mmhmm PM Okay so fifteen to thirty five look fairly young ME Yeah ID Yeah PM You know they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing ME Mmhmm ID I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ID I think people who are maybe about I wouldnt say thirty five but people who are about fortyish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME But yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah sure PM So Yeah ME Mmhmm ID So these are people who are gadgety right ID People who are u growing up used to you know in schools and in universities when you go on to their working lives people who would you know regular Yeah PM Yeah PM So theyll not sh not shy away from something quite hightech ID Yeah ME Yeah PM That thats thats a good point ID Mm PM Um okay so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can ME If we can ID I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now because um based on what youve go y everybodys saying right you want something simple ME Yeah PM Okay PM Why is that ID You want basic stuff and you want something thats easy to use ID Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use ME Right PM Okay ME Could it be an on off thing ID Um but what Im saying is that were were trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that were gonna say and then you know say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition is not good for this ME Like if you want it on Yeah PM Where you can activate it and deactivate it PM Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah PM Okay ME Sure ME Sure ID So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition anyway its a its something that can be used to fulfil a function but at end of the day we dont look at the technology but we look at the function first PM Okay ME Yeah ME Sure PM Uhhuh ME Yeah PM Okay ME Sure ME Yep PM Uh okay well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I dont know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss but this is this is how were Yeah exactly yeah ID Okay sure ME Yep ME Yeah its good well its good to get ideas out while theyre fresh in mind ME Um Not Yeah PM Oh its something thats just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition thats appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well PM Um ME And not losing ME And also it helps in terms of people not losing this you know they theyre saying oh its I lose it in the couch PM Yeah PM Yeah ME like were kind of what were b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they Right PM Mmhmm UI I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um Ive actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasnt particularly amazing so you end up yelling at the control for hours PM Really UI Channel up ME Oh really youve seen one before PM Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until its worthwhile incorporating it though UI Um I think itd probably quite expensive to put in ID Sorry do you mind passing me my notepad PM Mm PM Course not ID Thanks ID Cool um PM There you go ID Okay ID Um PM Right ID Well this is just the working design um PM Mmhmm ID Well this is just what how I would go about it ID Um I guess I try to define like what were doing now try to define what were trying to get done ID Um I think in a practical way we kind of know what it is ME Right ID Weve used it were familiar with it but were we cant n we havent narrowed down um exactly what the things were trying to fulfil like Besides the basics I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are ID Has to change channels has to change volume but in like specifics right which one of the basics are you trying to target ME Mmhmm ID Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ID Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design thats there as a basic so you know things that to start everything going ID But I guess everybody does have some idea so I dont think um theres a need for that ID Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing so Ill go into the diagram first ID It just explains how the process goes through from a from the basic technology point of view the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better PM Mmhmm ID Um okay you need some power source ID Kay a battery or something to keep it going PM Mmhmm ID Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last PM Uhhuh ID Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want ME Mmhmm ID Like for example voice recognition right ID That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone you might need to power other things so thats one perhaps constraint there ID Um Th Okay the basic thing is theres a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes whatever PM Hmm ID You know and that um picks up an input from a user um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device and the device has to r you know based on you push button A so I will do something with button A ID So maybe button A is the power button okay ME Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here ID Um and I think thats about it in terms of my design um ID Its fairly general um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way youre thinking like um voice recognition right um if its something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we dont have enough power PM Mmhmm ID So its not really a constraint in that sense but I mean these are functionally you know the base what the technology has to do PM Okay ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Okay PM Okay ME Mmhmm ID Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ID I think thats more relevant to a discussion ME Kay PM Uh PM Well do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ME Sure ME Sure ID Yeah w Im done PM Are you are you all done ID More or less ID Yeah ID Ps Oh its just putting the rest of it into words but its essentially the same thing ME Yep PM Mm ID Um you have a transmitter an input device logic chip you know stuff like that PM Okay PM Okay ME Right ID Um I guess this would be Yep PM Right ME And like on the means b Since were on the topic of the technology uh are there any like what are our options ME Alright whats what i in Is this the only way that we go about it or are there other thin Right ID Um these these arent technology options in that sense ID This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed ME The basic principle of Kay PM Okay ME Right PM Mmhmm ID For example if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition right then your user interface would be split broken down into more components right which you have a microphone the VR and stuff like that ME Okay PM Mmhmm PM Oh ME Okay PM So this just show how were kind of modularising the whole thing ID Uh Yep PM Okay ID Yep ID So each component represents one function but I think the basic functions are the logic the transmitter um and the receiver okay and the power are things that you wont have to care about PM Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then well add more functionality to it PM Mmhmm PM Okay ID Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the TV for example PM Okay ID Okay um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infrared thing ME Okay PM Okay ID Because thats something you need to actually be physically be pointing to PM Okay ME Right ID Right PM Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it its tried and tested intrared so we could stay with tha Mmhmm Oh yeah ID Yep ID There might be one other problem with the transmission um in particular right now since were talking about voice recognition ID Um if somebodys gonna h talk to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them ID I it you may not require that but you know um its its its something very natural I guess you know to hold it to signal to the user and push a button maybe to start s talking about it ME Right ME Right PM Yeah mmhmm PM Okay ID Then you need to send the signal out so because if youre using infrared the line of sight um say the TVs at that chair and Im standing in front of here and the transmitter is here it blocks it PM Mm PM Mm PM Yeah PM Okay ID So in that sense theres not really a restriction but its something which you may have to think about later on in the process ME Right ME Okay ID Not so much further down PM Okay ME And um just a clarification before we finish this ME Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ID Theres theres not much specific specific information but I think that um one indication of infrared mean that youre just targeting traditional devices PM W Yeah ME Okay ID Because infrared is something which everybody has PM W Well well weve um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the TV so thats what we should do for now I think ME Just to TV okay ME Okay PM Something I was wondering about was the power PM Um is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries PM I mean is that something we really want to go into do you think or should we just consider running on regular batteries ID Theres a theres Okay from from a from a component point of view theres added complexity and you add cost to it um and then theres probably the fact that you need another physical component PM Uhhuh PM Uhhuh ID You need a docking cradle for example for you to put it in to charge ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Okay ID Or you need to get the user to plug it in ID Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller PM Okay so Yeah ID But unless the controllers gonna consume a lot of batteries like hes gonna run through like twenty batteries a month then I dont think rechargeable is something we should you know we really need to care about PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Okay so just stick to to regular Okay ID Um PM Um right PM So basically the um Im just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who were gonna aim this at and what exactly the products gonna do ME Okay ME Okay PM So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ME Yeah thats good PM Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what its gonna do PM Do you wanna recap on that Craig UI Um UI I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible UI Um on off up and down channels up and down volume and uh skip to a channel PM Okay right UI Ta ME And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features or are we gonna eliminate those UI Um I think we include mute but apart from that um I think we just well go for the simpleness ME Okay PM Okay ID Okay I think Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ME R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some Cause what what Im Id be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they you know w they get ours and w its doesnt have that PM Yeah its as optional functions UI Yeah ME I dunno if thatd be a problem PM Okay PM Mmhmm ID Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories ME Yeah ME Okay ID One would be audio controls one would be video controls and the other one would be a device PM Mmhmm ME Okay ID Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially but I think that um from a manufacturers point of view from a person designing the device but I think from a point of view of a person using the device you know a TV is something they see and something they hear um its something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off ME Yeah PM Mmhmm PM Yeah ID I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets right where we could throw things into like if we want this feature lets throw it into there and then from there decide whether its basic or its nonbasic ME Right ME Yeah ME Kay okay ID I mean it might help with the visualisation ME Like that ME Okay ID And it would actually help with the component build as well ME Mmhmm PM Okay right ME Mm okay great PM Um okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now PM Um next thing were doing is having lunch PM Whoohoo PM Um and then were gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage PM Um so Ill be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder ME Mmhmm PM Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what were doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway um for uh our Industrial Designer youre gonna be thinking about the components concept ME Mmhmm PM Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface and marketing youre gonna be thinking about trend watching PM Um and youll all get specific instructions as well PM So um I dunno just just to to ask now if youve got anything else youve thought about while weve been talking PM Um do you wanna start with David PM Anything else to say at all ID Mm no not really PM No okay ME Um yeah just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that well u use this idea Davids proposed where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of okay were talking about this PM Andrew PM Yeah yeah I think thats definitely a good idea PM Uhhuh ME Shall we do that then ID Mm PM Yeah ME Okay great UI Um just about the three buckets um what would go in the the device functions one ID Um things like on off ID Because they dont have anything to do with what you see PM Yeah ID I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value you know um so um And channel PM Okay ME And and channel ME Right ID Because the on off also goes you know like on off like power not on off sound ID Not on off video PM Yeah ID Although you dont turn off the video on your TV but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound say you wanna pick up the phone theres a mute button right so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device PM Okay PM Okay ID Device is basically anything which we cant categorise right PM Okay so youre gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay ID We put it out ME Mmhmm ID Yeah anything to do with what you hear right ME Mmhmm ID You you put that into audio PM Okay and then visual Okay so brightness contrast things like that and then just actual device things like what channel youre watching turning on an off stuff like that ME Mmhmm ID And then video is anything that you can see ME Mmhmm ID Um ID Yep ME Colour yeah ID Yep ME Sure ME Sure ID Yep ME Okay PM Okay um Mmhmm ME And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah ID Like random which we have no other place to put but we need it somewhere there PM Yeah ME Sure okay PM Okay ME Okay ID Um even even if it doesnt map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind ID Its easy to use I think thats one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view its easy to build as well cause things are like fixed PM Okay ME Okay PM Okay PM Um so yeah I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact its gotta look good because of who were were you know targeting this at PM Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe ME Mmhmm PM Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold you know things like that ME Mmhmm PM Um so I guess I guess thats it ME Great PM Thats the meeting over PM Whoohoo ME Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us,The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product. The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist. The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources. The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them.
ID S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is so in that sense so it does kind of make sense yeah ME Yeah PM Okay ME Yeah sure PM Okay well Okay ME It kinda does make sense doesnt it because when we get into the end of meeting were kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background ID Yep ME Everything I have is kinda background PM Okay we all ready to go ID Yep PM Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um Ill just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting PM And we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five and we decided that it was gonna be nonrechargeable batterypowered that were gonna group our audiovisual and other functions into into those categories um ID Yep ME Mmhmm PM And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring everything except the TV and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan PM Um so that was the last meeting PM Is there anything have I forgotten anything ID Mmhmm ID No ME Uh that sounds PM Is that everything PM Okay PM Um so if we have the three presentations and then if you have anything to kind of that you know youre gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of it and well have all the discussion at the end PM That might be a better idea this time ME Sure PM And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David if thats alright ME Okay ME Sure PM Um and then after that well have to make some decisions about stuff right ID Yep ME Yeah cool PM So if you wanna take this ME Why dont I get that ME Hmm PM Screwed in quite tightly PM Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now PM We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadnt made a definite decision on that ID Mmhmm PM Right PM Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product ME Okay PM So um thats kind of the end result hopefully ME Okay ME Um alright so c is it function F eight PM Uhhuh PM Hopefully appear in a wee second ME Hmm ME Come on ME I think its working PM Up there we go ME Okay great s so let me just start this ME Okay great ME So um uh s move on ME Uhhuh oh whered it all go ME Its not good PM Oh no ME Okay lemme just see where I can find it ME This looks more like it ME I think I just opened up the template ME Sorry about that PM Oh right ME Okay alright so lets have a look here ME Okay so this was the method that um Ive taken PM Here we go ME Uh basically what I wanna do here before we get into it uh too far is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful PM Okay ME And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that Ive dealt with that information and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision ME Um so Ive tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project ME Does that make sense tha that sort of strategy PM Mmhmm ID Yep ME I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do so thats why I suggested we get in this PM Aye a fair point definitely ME Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general um consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control a fancy look and feel okay and not it specified not a functional look or or feel uh b f f fancy PM Okay ME Um however this is where we kinda have to be very I think creative about it ME Number two was that it be innovative ME Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it ME Uh and third priority uh for ease of use so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be um quite user friendly while still having technology ME So it Ill just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it ME For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something you know what I mean like or its got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use PM Aye right PM Uhhuh ME So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ME Well thats I guess where were gonna go with this PM Okay ME Okay then theres the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style okay which as weve agreed is a priority ME Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says theres this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables okay especially in clothes and furniture ME And when I first saw that I thought hmm well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it do you know what I mean PM Okay okay ME So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics ME Um cause I think what were in what were in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something I think that would be pushing it ME And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case ME So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last years mode so if we try and really capitalise on that I think thatll be in our favour ME Um So these this is the summary of everything ME Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who were selling to ME Uh innovative design technologys also a must in that its seen itd be seen to be uh cutting edge uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout ME That was like the number three thing ME And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um thats the way I interpreted it anyway softness in materials shape and function and so Ive written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion Mac iPods something which is Id have to say very hightech ten gigabytes whatever but when you hold it in your hand theres like no buttons PM Mmhmm ME You know what a Mac iPod is PM Mm thats true yeah ME Im thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last years because its very hard and sort of glassy and glossy so Im thinking if we imagine that were taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and were then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have ME Um and then so this is w with all that information what Im what Im suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go throughout ME Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all that we agree on uh sorta like a marketing identity ME Um Does that make sense ME Yeah ME So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon lime I dunno green colours pe whatever its just an idea cause Im thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture shape colours things like that PM Mm kay PM Great ME Like um the ones the ones which Im most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that you know something which is like you see a lot in in other areas ME Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway its just just an idea PM Okay PM Yeah ME Im thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it ME Like you know just within the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up q usually the buttons light up PM Ah ME How can we build on that ME Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so PM Okay ME Anyway those are thats all I have but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep PM Thats great PM Uhhuh PM Okay great PM Um thank you for that PM Uh Craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then UI Is it working PM Mm PM Not quite ME Did you press F eight ID Its probably not sending ID Yeah PM Oh something coming now yeah ID Yep there it is PM There we go UI And so think of this concept UI Um to research it Ive um had a look on the the homepage again UI Its provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls UI Um theres a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there um so Ive taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um So then this were looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons um the shape of the control and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control PM Mm UI Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them UI Um theyre not very attractive to look at and theyre not very comfortable to hold theyre I just hold em like big bricks and theyre very easily lost UI Um they tend to be very dark colours so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you cant really see them PM Mmhmm UI Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme UI Um for instance the standby button isnt always red uh it really should be UI Its uh something the user then uh identify with UI This is a red switch off thats how it should be UI Um Im not sure if theres any other examples of that but something to look out for UI Um theres a problem that Ive Ive got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get em with the the red colour button for standby and s the other examples of that um The buttons should be large UI They shouldnt be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones UI They should be easy to press very comfortable UI Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um theres an up and down volume button but both of them have a V on them so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button thats kinda confusing PM Mmhmm UI Um should avoid s things like that UI Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere PM Okay UI Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there but it could um tiein very easily with your your lime and lemon idea ME Yeah ME Okay do we have a corporate colour scheme ME I didnt know PM I think its yellow because like the website is yellow and theres a band at the bottom is yellow so yellow lemon you know definitely food for thought there but keep going and well discuss it after ME Okay ID And the PlayDoh s yellow ME Okay UI Fantastic ME Okay UI Um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden they shouldnt be on the um shouldnt be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort ME Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebodys voice maybe they got a cold or Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look UI Thats just wrong ME Mmhmm PM Mm kay UI And um we got an email uh from I think its the the research department and theyve said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question PM Mm UI So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility PM Aye thats a good idea yeah UI Right and these are problems Ive had with it UI Um I dont know where the slogan should go or really what the slogan is UI I think its um fashion into electronics PM Yeah UI And we dont know how flexible the colour scheme is UI I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours but they dont say you know if we can use any other colours at all or Thats it ME Mm ME Mm PM Okay ID Cool PM Okay ME Great ME Lots of good information there PM Yeah that that was very good and uh now with David ID Mmhmm ID Mm kay um UI I think Im cool ME Its a shame the cable wasnt just in the middle of the table huh PM I know itd be handy wouldnt it ME Just um It takes a second doesnt it ID Oops PM Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um Yeah ID Yeah okay ID Let me just get this going first ID Ah there it is ID Kay that should be it ID Okay um I guess the same thing again I started with something very basic ID So just so you guys have some idea of whats involved in my process um and then you can just work through it and we ll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are ME Mmhmm ID Um the components are exactly the same PM Mmhmm ID Um I think like what you guys said um the most input thats needed is basically in the user interface ID The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity ID Um like you said time to market was a problem um and how many components are physically in there in cost ID And the power is basically a factor of that ID Um and the lower components the power the logic the transmitter and the infrared um they affect you in terms of the size of your device um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like weve said weve defined like we only want the basic things that to be visible and the rest of them we try to hide ME Mmhmm ID So um you know its just a matter of working out space ID So I guess three things um cost um complexity and the size ID These are the three things that um will have an impact on you ID So just go through it in the components ID Um these are the options that are available to you um Im not very sure about the voice thing cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are UI Right ID Um it said it could talk to you but it never said anything about being able to listen ID I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that ME Mm PM Hmm ID So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you um cause they got back to me with like different requirements or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons okay and you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel okay theres an LCD display um I think these are quite standard things UI Right PM Mm ME Mmhmm ME Theyre standard arent they ID No um theyre well in the sense that these are all the options available for you ID Ill explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later ME Yeah ID Okay um then theres um how the case actually looks ID It can actually be flat or it can be curved um and then the different types of materials that you can use um I dont think you can use them in a combination um but um I could check back for you but I dont think you can actually use them in a combination PM Mmhmm PM We you couldnt have like plastic and rubber ID Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine but plastic rubber and wood I wasnt Im not very sure about the titanium PM Yeah ID They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium ME Hmm PM Mm kay ID Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing so I think that there is some restriction on um I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one PM Okay PM Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID You know as opposed to two ME Mmhmm ID Um and the other components are logic chips um again Ill Ill go back to the component chips ID The com how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost ID Um I dont think the logic chip has a issue about size cause they should be about the same size ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Power consumption should be about the same ID Um I think the main impact is complexity um and the other thing is um the power options ME Hmm ID Um the first one is a standard battery ID Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing its a windup you know a crank PM Ill clear one of these things for you PM Just by moving it yeah ME Hmm ID Yeah but that that might be something I think thats more of a look and feel decision because I dont think you can have one power source if youre using the alternative power sources ID I think whatever it is you still need a battery cause I dont think anybody wants to keep doing one thing PM Mm ME No ID Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons cause half the year youd be dead ME Yeah ID So like what I said you probably need like a battery and something else ME Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because its movement and people like to fiddle with their and its a nice sales gimmick I think PM Mm ID From a marketing gimmick it its a technology thing its a shake it it doesnt work shake it knock it or something ME Mmhmm ID You know you know you have you had those balls you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber PM W yeah ME Hmm PM Uh yeah yeah I see ME Yeah ME Hmm ID You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it kind of you know just uh you know um so PM Yeah ME Hmm PM I know what you mean yeah ID Um okay my from my role I dont think that personal preferences but role preferences I think um something comfortable to hold um small and slim I guess thats more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you cant you know like a phone or something too small phone ME Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit PM Mmhmm ID Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so ME Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions ID Um The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons are standard okay the LCD panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic PM Mm ID Um the case okay with a rubber case you cant have the solar panels ID Okay with the titanium case let me just check that um titanium case cant be curved it has to be square PM Okay ID Okay um theres no restriction on the plastic and it cant be curved on the wood ME It cant be curved ME Okay ID So thats again I dont think you can use them in a combination um especially the titanium I I suspect theyre very fixed to a particular need PM Okay PM Right ID So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep PM Okay PM Right can I Yeah well yeah its just Im quite keen to get the discussion going with the time weve left so but yeah you c ask away ID Thats it ME Uh question on can I ask a question ME Okay ME Can we uh power a light in this ME Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ID Um I think we could because the LCD panel requires power and the LCD is a form of a light so that Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein its alive PM Mm ME Okay ME So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery PM Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ME Well I mean Im thinking it might be That for uh this to be a hightech thing its gonna have to have something hightech about it and thats gonna take battery power and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is can the battery power it PM Uhhuh PM Yeah ME Illuminate the buttons ME Yeah it glows ME Well m Im thinking along the lines of youre youre in the dark watching a DVD and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this and thats what everybody does ID Okay ME Oh wheres the volume button in the dark and uh y you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something PM Yeah yeah yeah ID Okay PM Like a phone yeah like the backlight in a phone ID Okay ME Like a phone yeah yeah PM Okay cool ME Whereas with phones people charge them once a week PM Yeah ME Were gonna need to put in a really good battery so people dont have to charge their r remote control every few days ID Um thats why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch like an automatic watch um its probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it ME But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller PM Mm ME Right ID So you could trigger that to a light like I said the bouncing ball thing or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up right and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness ME Sure PM Mm PM Okay ME Okay ME Right PM Okay ME Mmhmm PM Right okay um well lets just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start and just giving an id idea on the time weve got about fifteen minutes to play with at most ME Okay great ME Okay PM So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product PM So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate colour and things like that ME Okay ME Yeah ME Yeah PM Um I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together PM I mean thats kind of the user interface type of thing what are your thoughts on that UI Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape UI Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit PM So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably or do you th youd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy UI Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably sort of feels right in your hand PM Okay um right okay PM Colourwise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I cant remember who made the point about how if youve a nice bright colour youll not lose it was that Whose about how if you have a bright colour youll not lose it so much ID I think he made that ME Whats that ME Yeah PM Um and when the corporate colour is yellow I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I dont know ME Okay PM Um And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ME Well I mean Im thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel PM Thats all PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize ME Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour you said company colour yellow PM Mmhmm ME I mean if we think of something like I was saying also lime and lemon you know what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series PM Mmhmm ME We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things PM Okay PM Right ID Is there a particular shape that youre interested in ID Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ID Does it need with a square thing wha Yeah cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit PM Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material yeah ME Yeah PM Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones and theyre plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch ID Im thinking fruits in my head but thats tacky UI See Im Id quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape PM It feels a bit more comfortable and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it ME Yeah PM And then then we could have curved shapes cause wood or titanium yeah its gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um Well Im do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I dont think we do either ME No no no not at all ME Its more more just that we we think about like what it is were trying to achieve so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with ME Do you know what I mean PM Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing PM A snowman shape UI Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need PM Uhhuh PM Thats quite a distinctive shape that would be good wouldnt it ME Right sure ME Yeah PM Yeah so yeah should we go with that ME Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it PM Do you wanna draw it on the board UI Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there ME Okay PM Ooh thatd be good ME Okay PM Mmhmm ME Yep PM So call it the snowmanshape trademark PM Yeah thats cool PM Um and I mean colourwise what does everybody think PM I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere PM I mean do you want the whole thing yellow maybe like yellow and white do you want something Uhhuh ME Mm UI So I reckon itd look quite nice if we just had um this here had a sorta background yellow and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons PM Okay cool PM Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in PM The fact that it talks to you I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says what is it putting fashion into electronics or something I dunno PM Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere UI I think that might scare me PM I d I d any thoughts on that at all UI I think thatd probably scare me UI You turn it on your control possessed s PM I know PM Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an LCD display where would we put that PM Would we put that on the inside or Its bound to increase the cost of it a lot I wouldve thought UI Um Nah ID Do we need an LCD display ID What whats the functionality of that ID Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ME What would it achieve ID Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an LCD panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mmhmm ME Well LC well Id when you used to mention the LCD Id think I wonder what that would be about ME And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings ME So as you scroll through cause we said we might have a jog dial so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is PM Yeah ID I think that will be a problem because we dont have an input device to get the listings into it so um its a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know ME Right okay PM Mm oh yeah thats true PM Yeah PM So so no need for an LCD display ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Um I Im not saying theres no need for an LCD display but um its whats what what would it tell the user cause the LCD tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user PM I think that would make it very complex PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Mm not real Mmhmm ID We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker is there a need for the remote control to to talk back PM I dont know if there is really no um I would say no need for a talkback ID Um You could put a game on it PM Uh does anybody disagree with that ME No PM No PM Easy ID When the TV dies you can play with the remote control ME Mm mm PM Okay um right so youre gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman body of the snowman inside of the snowman is that what youre thinking UI Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you dont usually use could be hid inside PM Okay UI B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones theyd have to go on the the front somewhere PM Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ME Well i I was just Yeah ID Where would you physically position the buttons ID Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things ME Yeah UI Um Yeah I think so yeah ID Um maybe you wanna draw onto the Yep PM So Im just gonna um pop this in here cause I have a slide about decision making which Id forgotten about PM Oh sh God weve got five minutes um okay uh back we go PM Um energy what do you think thats suggesting were how were powering the thing PM I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where youd have the backup of the battery but have have kinetic power I mean what does anybody think about that ME Yeah sure ME Um Ive had kinetic things before and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that youre committing the user to moving it and watches yeah Sure okay right okay ID No like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing so its not gonna charge the battery its just Yeah PM Okay ME Support for it ME I mean just its just worth pointing out because like Ive Ive known Ive known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time and its just like magic because its always powered and theres no battery PM Mmhmm ME Ive also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time and they eventually just say its just too much of a nuisance because I dont wear it all the time PM Yeah ID Yep ME Like remote control is similar youre away on vacation I dunno whatever you something and it just starts to get worn down PM Yeah ME So we should think about Yeah PM Well I suppose that if youre if youre away and youre not using it then youre not using any power either PM So youd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea Im really sorry were gonna have to wrap up quite quickly we dont have as much time as I thought ME Yep PM Um so I think thats what energy is referring to here PM Chip on print is that thats an industrial design thing is it David ID Yes yes PM Okay um as for the case kind of discussed that Yeah I know were gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay ME And this size here Id suggest this be small like quite small ME Um just a a lot of the um I mean one of the things running through my mind right now I realise were being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being lowtech rubber buttons plastic frame its almost like were reproducing the same old remote control thats out there PM Mmhmm PM Mm kay ME Should we think about how we are actually getting this hightech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that were u were using to to achieve those goals ME Like Okay so so backlighting that would be good PM Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that ID Or even a clear case ID Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable but in the dark it sort of its alive ME Yeah clear thatd be Okay PM Aye that would be a good idea ME Yeah sure ID Um in in a slight subtle way PM S so like cur slightly transparent case so its yellow like tinted yellow but you can maybe see through it ME Yeah thatd be really good ID Yeah yeah ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Is that what you mean ID Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse ME Sure ID You know you have cordless mice and they dont eat that much power right ME Yeah yeah ID So the power the battery in that sense maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow doesnt make it freaky ME Yeah ME Sure ME Yeah they they emanate a light through it PM Okay PM Lights ME Kay ME Yeah mmhmm PM Okay ME Um and then the other thing that we were s weve committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity and so Im thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled cause thats the main thing people will f wanna do PM Mm ME Could we use like a jog dial like a nice just sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it ID The question is when youre rolling it how do you wanna roll it ME Or Yeah ID Do you want em to roll it like that ID Do you want em to roll it like that ID Cause in a mouse your hands in a position to roll it whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way it tends to get moved accidentally UI Mm PM Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that couldnt you ME Well why dont we do it like a mouse then PM If youre holding it in your hand you could Do you think ID Thats a very unnatural motion to yeah PM Okay ID Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot ID Um it might work for volume and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that but not for channels right ME Yeah PM Mm ID If you have a Telewest box youve got like you dont have to buy all the channels youve about fifty channels can you imagine trying to ME Mmhmm PM Yeah okay okay um Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah sure ID Um and I dont think having that you know too quick too slow kin its confusing to the I dunno ME Mm UI Well but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button the number part ID But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience theyre like Because thats becomes the most accessible thing in front of Yeah ME Yeah PM Okay UI Uh but Yeah PM Okay ME But thats not a bad thing is it PM Just Okay um right well wouldnt it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly ME Because when you think about it the alternative is to go push the button ME Jog dials are much easier than that ME You just roll PM Um Im all for them actually I think theyre quite you know th very quick to m to use ME Yeah ME Yeah PM So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all PM No PM And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ME Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here I wouldnt be surprised if we could take this idea imagine that I dunno that its within the shape of the hand its quite small I dunno PM Uhhuh PM Uhhuh ooh okay we really gotta wrap up so yeah ME Yeah ME Its small and that weve got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side and that yeah well I mean isnt that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now PM Okay well if we can do that great PM Yeah okay PM Yeah lets lets try and get the slogan on there um and Mm ME Yeah ME And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here in with the It would get bumped its doesnt really fit with your hand ID So you wanna expand the shape of the That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether youre left handed or youre right handed you might be locking yourself in ME Yeah ME Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here UI Mm ID Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly PM Okay PM Right Im gonna have to Im really gonna have to hurry you on here cause were were actually over time ME A jog di Yeah ME Its kind of yeah Yeah PM Um is there anything anybodys unsure about PM Just for in closing just the next meetings gonna be in thirty minutes and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Playdoh on that PM So um thatll be thatll be good ME Huh PM Um and Ill get the the minutes up as soon as possible PM Anything at all you think we havent discussed that we need to PM Is everybody kind of happy about what theyre gonna be doing ME Um Yeah I think the jog dial you know it just after you drew that what if it was flat and you just spun it thatd be great ID Um I think one thing would be the jog dial cause thats gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um Yeah thats what I was thinking the a slide because then you you dont have to put the hand ME Yeah ME Yep ID I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward ID Theres lots of space for it um Yeah but its also a a marketing and a function Yeah PM Okay PM Thats kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss yeah ME Sure yeah yeah and materials we sorta said wed do plastic and rubber didnt we and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons cause thatd just be so standard PM Okay PM Yeah PM To make something flush with the case ME Something a bit more flush yeah or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well so that it has and also t plastic Ive seen can get really textured so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand PM Okay right PM Okay PM Sp kinda grippy ID Feel like fruit PM Okay ID Fruits kids ME They feel kind of like um you get pens now and then that youd think that they were rubber but theyre not theyre actually just plastic thats textured kind of a little bit like Okay ID No like Yeah yeah ID Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah PM Okay Im gonna have to Im gonna have to call this to a close cause were way over time PM So um thats really good like weve s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so PM So off you go and design stuff wooh ME Okay ID Playdoh time PM Yeah quite jealous actually ID You got to choose first ID No were kidding ID Okay can I just swipe your power cable I dont think it matters ID Okay lemme okay Im gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left ID Its you ID Argh ID This is a real hassle and a oops ID Im gonna take the microphones cause its too lazy t take them off again ID Cool,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports, stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel, is technologically innovative, is easy to use, and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design. The interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes, concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability. The interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team's design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design. The industrial designer presented options for materials, components, and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials. The team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote, as well as what components, batteries, and materials to use."
PM Okay we all all set PM Right PM Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting PM Um were gonna discuss the look and feel design the user interface design and were gonna evaluate the product PM And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control like absolute final decision um and then Im gonna have to specify the final design in the final report PM So um just from from last time to recap we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no LCD display no need for talkback it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing um hopefully a jogdial and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well PM Anything Ive missed ID No PM Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead ME Uhoh ME This is it ID Ninja Homer made in Japan ME Um there are a few changes weve made ME Um well look at the expense sheet and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside so instead weve um this is gonna be an LCD screen um just a a very very basic one very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button PM Okay PM Mm PM Mmhmm UI Mm kay ME Uh apart from that its just pretty much the same as we discussed last time ID And there isnt uh d it doesnt open up to the advanced functions ID So the advanced functions are still hidden from you but theyre hidden in the sense that um theyre not in use UI Where are they ID Um theyre in the LCD panel and the jogdial UI Ah right ID Okay cause The LCD panel just displays um functionally what youre doing UI Great PM So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mmhmm ID If youre using an advanced function right like um c brightness contrast whatever it will just say You know its like it only has four columns its a very simple LCD like whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast UI Right UI Okay UI Right UI Right kay PM Okay cool ID It might even be one a bit more complex LCD panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the you know the the symbols of the various functions UI Okay UI Mmhmm and what is this here PM Oh right okay PM Cool ID Thats a number pad UI Okay so the number pad is Kay great PM Where are we gonna have the slogan ID Um theyre al along this Yeah ME You know just like right inside there PM Okay cool ID You have this space here and then you have this thing on the side as well or at the bottom PM Okay ID Cause slogans are usually quite small right theyre not like huge so theyre s Say a buttons about say a buttons about this size right so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan say even for that UI Mm UI Yep PM Okay UI Looks good UI Yep UI Mmhmm PM So if this isnt to scale what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ME Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe thatll be about the same size as the palm of your hand PM Mmhmm UI Okay ID Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button so one two three four centimetres ID Plus maybe half o five six seven eight about yeah nine total UI Mmhmm UI About nine in total PM Six seven eight nine ten PM So were talking about ten centimetres UI That sounds good UI Yeah PM That would be good UI Yep PM So ten centimetres in height ID Nine ten ID Yep PM Okay um UI Thatd be good in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually so that would be that sounds like a really good size if you see it there PM Yeah PM Thats great and its very bright as well UI Mm PM So um okay UI Is it possible uh Im just gonna bring up the idea of colours UI Is these are these the colours that of production or is this just what we had available ME Well Im Were gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button UI Right ME Um But um this button um because its red its sort of very prominent were gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds itll send a standby signal PM Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report PM Mmhmm ME Um apart from that its gonna be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen and you use this as a jogdial ID Excuse me ID Sure PM Okay PM Okay so thats like an okay button right UI Mmhmm ID Oh weve discussed how h high it is but how wide is it ME I dont know PM Okay UI How high is it ID No as in the height but what about the width UI Yeah ME Didnt put five centimetres PM Oh oh like depth of the actual thing ID Do we need five ID I dont think five is be about th three and a half ME Um UI Okay ME Something by there PM Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay ID Yeah yeah UI Sure PM So you can power on and off what else can you do UI Three and a half ME Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons PM Okay ME Um were gonna have the volume control here but um because weve got the the LCD and the jogdial we just thought wed um use that as the volume PM Okay jogdial for volume PM And what else do you do with the jogdial UI Mmhmm ME Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast colour and Um yeah PM Contrast brightness yeah and anything else ME Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions um we didnt actually go through and specify the Uh what can a TV do PM Well of the designers what are they ID Okay things like um brightness contrast um maybe tuning the channels PM Uhhuh PM Okay channel tuning ID Um PM Thats a good one ID What else ID Um the various inputs ID Are you having a VCR are you having you know which input do you have UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM Okay auxiliary inputs UI Mmhmm probably colour or sharpness ID Um ID Yep colour sharpness PM Sharpness ID Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them UI Mmhmm PM Okay what about uh sound settings PM Uh d can you change any of those at all UI Audio ID Audio we have like your basic y your base your midrange your high range ME Um ID Um ME the the balance hmm ID Yep leftright balance um maybe even preprogrammed sound modes like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting PM Okay UI Mmhmm PM Okay is there anything else at all it can do UI Mm kay ID Yeah PM That cause thats thats fine PM Just need to know so I can write it down PM Okay um right I g I guess thats it so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all ME Mmhmm PM So um for this first part here powerwise have we got battery ID The battery PM Do we have kinetic as well ID No PM No PM Okay just battery ID Um ID We need an Yep PM And thats because of cost restraints is it ME Yeah PM Okay um what about the electronics here ID Yeah advanced chip ID We need an advanced chip I think yep PM Advanced chip ID Let me just confirm that ID Yes I think so ID Yep PM Okay um the case what does it mean by single and double do you know ME Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing ID Yeah PM So we want doublecurved ID Yep PM Okay PM Um ID Plastic PM Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay um and we wanted special colours didnt we ID I think were gonna have to skip the rubber ID Um ID Yep PM So Ill have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ID For the case itself one colour ID Its one special colour PM Just one colour okay ID Cause the case unit itself the rest of our components go on top of it PM Okay so interfacewise is it this third option we have the two of them there UI Mm ID Yes ID One and the LC display PM Okay and then buttons we have what two colours ID How many Weve got push buttons as well ME Um we have um got some push buttons as well UI Or even clear PM Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay ME Kay ME So I reckon weve got one button for this thing cause its just one big sheet of rubber PM Uhhuh ME Im not sure if that counts but You can see were were all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved just fill in those bits PM Okay ID Okay lets just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one PM Okay ID Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons so maybe four again PM Four PM So w why are we arriving at the number four PM Where does the number four come from ID Cause thats one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons PM Okay right so were writing down four ID So were just estimating that yeah it would be less PM Okay PM How about these PM Are we wanting them in no theyre just is everything gonna be plastic ID No ID Yep ID Yep PM Okay PM So were w w quite far over PM Now were gonna somethings gonna have to go PM Um were at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro so let me see what are we I mean oh yes sorry four point three UI Uh how mmhmm how are we going to achieve this highend product if We only have very sparse Two point three UI Four point three no PM My maths is all out PM Yeah UI And then where is the Mmhmm ID How much would that save us PM How much would that save us ID That will only save you one ME That is one PM One ID The other thing could be that um you could take away the LCD panel and the advanced chip together um because when you do something on the TV the TV responds and reacts as well so the user could be looking at the TV and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the TV to respond which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep ME Thats fair enough yeah UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Okay so So w whats our reviewed suggestion UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Um take away the LC display ID And the advanced chip goes away as well UI Mmhmm PM To be replaced with a regular chip ID Regular chip ID Yep UI Mmhmm PM Okay ID So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there PM And so weve got point three to get rid of PM Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now PM Twelve buttons ME Thats um one piece of rubber but its gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons PM Yeah ID Functionally youre gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah so you cant actually cut Its like three times the number of buttons four eight twelve PM Do you think PM Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons how can it be something in between ID It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone underneath theres actually one button underneath its just that the panel itself is a single panel UI Mmhmm PM Mm UI Mmhmm PM Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere ID We just report that it has to be over budget or the colours you could take away s colours for th for the buttons PM Mm PM No can do UI Yeah we could just go with um Hmm ID Normal coloured buttons PM Well do you want colour differentiation here ID No thats not the button were talking about PM Oh yeah sorry yeah then ID Thats the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh PM Right so Ah ID Hey its back to the original PM Thats it ID Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons so that might be some some way of cutting the cost UI Mmhmm UI Mm PM Okay ach thats a shame PM Um right so take away that completely PM Ah PM And now were under budget PM So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted PM Um Doesnt say so UI How about with embossing the logo isnt that going to cost us some money UI Yeah UI Thats a freebie ID Yeah PM Yeah thats a good idea PM Just one PM Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay ME I think theres just one button so handy PM Well well there we go PM So Im just gonna have to redraw this now PM So were not gonna have the LCD anymore and well just gonna have an on t on the TV itll show you what youre doing which I think is fair enough and so this is gonna be one big thing here PM Um UI Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ID What do you mean by profile ME Yeah UI Sort of flat as possible ID No ME You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat UI Yeah UI Yeah thats what I was thinking to Sure okay ID We didnt have enough PlayDoh to make it three D UI Yeah alright yeah fair enough UI Okay just thought Id ask ID So theres one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add and you might want to add in the report length width and height UI Mmhmm PM Right okay ID Yeah PM So just to well to be thorough then widthwise were looking at about what three centimetres or something ID Yeah PM Okay and then so heightwise How how tall do you envisage it being UI Hmm PM About that big ME Yeah it works yeah ID Two PM About two centimetres okay UI Twos not very high at all though UI Maybe a bit higher ID This is about this is about two ID Slightly more than two so Okay ME See about that thick UI Yeah PM Okay UI Maybe closer to three even or two and a half PM Ach that is Yeah PM Okay well s well say two point five PM Okay um so we have it within cost anyway PM Um so yeah project evaluation is this point PM Um UI Mmhmm PM Right uh PM Okay so can we close that PM This is what its the final spec that its gonna be UI Mmhmm PM Someone is gonna have to yeah thats fine thats fine UI Um its probably just I dunno if its worth getting into but um just in in that we want this to be stylish should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid because Ive seen theres lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah ID I think thats something thats very hard to catch so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something UI Sure okay ID The the look and the colour is something which is cool but I think that theres also that factor of if its too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change rather than rather than positioning cause I think positioning is were kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad UI Yeah alright UI Okay sure UI What about button shape UI Square buttons UI Okay UI Yeah UI Sure ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Okay PM Right um PM So at this point we uh let me see discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork and the stuff we had around us I guess UI Mm kay PM Um let me see uh Yeah I wasnt really sure what that was Yeah yeah go for that first UI Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ID Maybe we should do the design evaluation first UI Or Evaluation PM I wasnt entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that but y you go for it UI Okay UI Sure UI Um alright so the way this works Im gonna need to plug into PowerPoint Ill try and do it as quick as possible PM Okay PM Okay UI Um this is um Ill just go over your head if thats okay PM Yeah ID I dont think you need the power so No thats okay thats okay UI Whats that UI I dont need the PowerPoint ID No the power cord itself UI Oh course yeah thats true ID Yeah so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers UI Let me get that UI A bit more UI Okay so what this is is a setup for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that Ive set up Ive reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan and uh so we can review that ME Is it ID You killed a monster UI Uh I think its gonna end up being sort of elementary because were sort were in n were not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesnt seem like its going does it PM Oh there it is UI Yeah okay great UI Uh and Im gonna write up our results on the board so thisll be a way for us to go through and decide if were um sort of review where we stand with it UI Okay so um So to sort of b bring together two things sort of design goals and also the market research that we had uh when we rate this one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low okay PM Mm kay UI So these i these i th are the and um weve been asked to uh to collectively rate this so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement PM Okay UI Okay UI So the first one uh stylish look and feel ID I rate that pretty highly PM Well yeah I mean compared to most remote controls you see thats pretty good ME Yeah UI Yeah PM I dunno like a six or something UI Yeah UI Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because its the companys colour and I dont know if yellows gonna really be a hit PM What does anybody else think PM Mm PM Mm UI But What do you guys think PM Okay ME Im seeing five then PM I would say five or six UI Okay PM David ID Yep Im fine with that UI Okay lets go with five then PM Okay UI Fi oh uh just actually the opposite ID Its one to seven right UI The So it meant three okay PM Oh yes sorry then then I would say two or three ID Wait whats the scale one to seven right ME Ones highish isnt it PM Yeah UI Yeah one is high ME Ah okay so yeah two or three UI Kay Lets go with two point five then ID Okay its upsidedown UI Okay um control high tech innovation PM Well it has the wee jogdial but Mm UI We had to remove Yeah so weve had to remove a few of our features we wanted but jogdial s good PM Id go with three or four maybe three ID Say its more medium but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing ME Eight three UI Okay three PM Yeah about three okay ID Yep UI Okay um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour design UI I shouldnt have said colour but just Sorta ID Lemon PM Well thats kind of But the yellow I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour couldnt it ID Okay the blue the blue colours and dont re dont actually represent the colour except for the b the the red button they because for want of a Yeah the the yellow is more representative of the colour but the button itself the blue can be anything else ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Okay UI Right UI Yeah could be UI Yeah UI Okay PM Yeah UI Okay so well go two PM Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Okay and um design is simple to use simple in features PM Well yeah I mean its really basic looking isnt it UI F f yeah f fairly basic you guys think PM I mean Id give that nearly a one ME Yeah one ID Yep thats fine UI Yeah one UI Okay UI Um soft and spongy have we achieved that UI Weve used mostly plastic in the end so its going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price ME Yeah I think its about five UI Five PM Five PM Thats really low ME Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so its probably gonna be I think Id probably increase the cost PM Well Yeah I suppose mm kay UI Thats Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ID Yeah company logo UI Was that an option ID I think itll be cost prohibitive yeah ME Weve only got like what ten cents left so Yeah UI It would cost more than plastic UI Okay logo weve got it in there havent we ID Yep PM Yep PM Gonna have that on the side arent we like there or something UI Huh UI And um its within budget yep UI It is isnt it UI Okay so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here PM Out of forty nine I guess UI Yeah out of forty nine with with zero being the highest UI We are at uh two seven eight ten fifteen point five PM S pretty good UI So its pretty good UI Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal UI Right PM Uh yeah UI I think cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one and then invert that its Oh right about seventy yeah seventy percent PM Twice that about thirty one PM So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine seventy percent yeah PM Its pretty good UI Okay good UI That was just a little formality for us to go through PM Okay UI Yep oh hundred pound pen UI Sorry alright PM Nobody saw it honestly UI No ID The cameras did UI Hmm PM Is that you all have all finished or Uhhuh UI Yeah thats thats me UI I did have one other um one other frame I thought I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design revisiting our original goals UI Its not something I need to p push through but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that its more of like a line where we have like sort of the I dont know like the harvest line or the vibrant I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones lime green lemon PM Mmhmm ID Yep PM Okay UI Its just discussion UI I mean obviously we can just abandon this its fine UI Im just thinking about what we originally set out to do UI Um yep so there PM Right UI Thats all PM Okay great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I PM I dont know what your instructions have been UI Um I think to record it and uh I havent been asked to submit it yet UI Yeah PM Okay uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes because if youre submitting it anyway then Okay great UI I will yeah ID It keeps getting too big PM Cool PM Um right uh well next up then because weve done finance is the project evaluation ID Kay Im Im listening Im just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing so Im playing with the PlayDoh as well PM Oh right okay ID Just in case youre wondering why is he still playing with the PlayDoh UI Huh ID Just about right LEGO Lego ME My leg PM Right okay PM Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points my four points sorry forgotten that PM You got a different uh Oh yeah theyre good arent they yeah UI Yep UI I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that UI Its really quick PM Right okay um yeah here we are UI To use PM Uh as a note well do this alphabetically PM Um do you wanna start Andrew UI Sure um so what is it youre asking of me now PM I dont know just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them UI Or sort of our work on setting this up PM Yeah UI Yeah UI Well is it uh okay Ill just go through your system then UI The the room uh is fairly institutional but um the main thing is I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion you know as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity whereas in reality as weve gone through this its not really the centre point of creativity its more just a d debating Yeah yeah but thats just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there the room it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then you know PM Uhhuh PM Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing PM But I dont I dont think it means the room as in this room PM I think it means like you know Yeah UI Oh oh right right oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard digital pens the room PM Room PM Oh yeah UI No of course yeah PM Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mmhmm UI Sorry UI Huh UI Yeah UI Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms Id say that actually theres sort of a tease of creativity because were asked to work through this but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends say fruit and vegetable colour scheme but then i then were told okay use the co company company colours PM Mm UI So what do we do UI Were told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology but build something for twelve and a half pounds so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah PM Okay ID You feel like youre caged within whatever y Its like a balloon in a cage it can only go so big and not hit the side PM Okay ID The constraints do come in very fast UI Yeah yeah PM Okay uh do you know what actually lets take each point and everybody discuss it I think UI So Yeah PM Yeah PM So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig ME Um I agree with his point its um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right gotta cut everything out cause we dont have enough money PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Yep ID I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings so time is also a very s um strong factor and structure UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ID Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed um to be evaluated and to be reviewed and to get feedback and come back UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM Mm UI Yeah yeah ID And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that I think thats a very big thing and I think the fact that were wearing these things restricts I feel it cause I wear m my glasses right and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how w whether you feel comfortable to communicate UI Yeah UI Yeah sure PM Yeah UI Yeah UI New creativity ID I feel like Im hiding behind the equipment rather than the equipment is helping me and you know UI Yep UI Right PM So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah but actual environment ID Not not so much an atmosphere the atmosphere is very relaxed but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me UI Mm UI Mmhmm PM Okay UI Mmhmm PM Okay PM Very good PM Um what about leadership PM I dont know if that means like if I did a good job or something PM I dont really know UI Yeah well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think just sort of acting as team leader PM From like your personal coach person and stuff like that do you think maybe PM Okay UI Um yeah I think I think its I think its good UI I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know innovative thought with PM Mmhmm UI In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within UI And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member so But its not bad leadership its just sort of s fairly strong you know PM Uhhuh okay UI It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah oh yeah without without a doubt PM So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay ID I think controlling is not the right word I think the interactions are very structured UI Yeah maybe not co confining ID I think structure is probably what youre saying that each individual is structured to one particular task and one parti rather than controlling UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Mmhmm mmhmm ID I dont think theres a sense of control cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a like a consensus right we go around and we think about it but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM Uhhuh UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Okay ID It doesnt tell you you know some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesnt have a you know a messenger will go UI Mm UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Yeah PM Okay uh what about teamwork UI Um did you wanna comment Craig ME Uh reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting UI Yeah PM Yeah ME If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them that wouldve been a lot easier UI Yeah PM Okay UI Fully agree PM Mm UI Yeah PM Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you UI Yeah ME Not just yet ID Yeah PM Oh thats alright UI Yeah got the email PM I was wondering if that got there okay ID Okay PM Okay um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting you know just like quick questions quick thoughts whatever it probably would be bit easier UI Yeah UI Yeah in it Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm exactly ID I think the tools that they were given the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they dont support collaboration I think thats the word ID They dont support the team working together you know theyre still very individual tools PM Oh right okay UI Yeah I mean if you Yeah I mean sort of taking upon that idea w the way I see this i is that its uh the the s the structure in which weve weve approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided and then the work went on in isolation I I dont know what you guys did while you were together maybe that was a bit different but um yeah but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay first thing we have to do is come up with um lets say um a design concept and we sit here together and do it well thats what teamwork is PM Mm ID We had PlayDoh fun PM Yeah UI To s to say okay go off and dont talk to each other its actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork PM Yeah PM Okay UI Um not that we havent done I think the best we could have done PM Okay UI Im not dissatisfied with it PM Right uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ID No not really PM Okay um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard the digital pens the projector stuff like that PM Um did anybody think anything was like really useful anything was pretty un f unsupportive UI Mmhmm UI I think the whiteboard for me is the kind of thing I would use all the time but its um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been maybe just in the way that we we use it in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text PM Mm UI Um and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that UI I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and its completely you know um abs abstract from the final product but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybodys as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks were just were actually just each of us discussing something thats in each of our own minds PM Mmhmm PM Yeah PM And point at PM Yeah UI It wasnt until we had this here you know like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craigs paper and Im like now I know what hes thinking cause I saw his book PM Yeah PM Ah UI But the b the b whiteboard couldve actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be yeah PM So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ID I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think PM Yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Mmhmm ID It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah PM Okay UI Yeah because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare whereas I can imagine if Id been encouraged to use Paintbrush for example or whatever I wouldve actually used it um ca you know just cause thats sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time PM Alright PM Okay uh Yeah UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Cause the plugin and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that UI Yeah ID And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints I dont think you know we needed to actually it could have we could have gone through it verbally especially my slides I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them PM Yeah UI No not quite UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Okay UI Yeah PM What about the digital pens did you find them easy enough to use ME Oh theyre a bit clunky UI Sure yeah ID Yep clunky ID Agreed PM Yeah UI Yeah UI Yep PM Clunky okay UI Mm PM Um Yeah ID Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well cause youre half way through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump UI Mm PM I know I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff didnt click note on one then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page but then did click note and so Im quite worried that Ive just written over the top of it or something but theyll have my paper anyway um and havent done that since UI Yeah UI Hmm UI Hmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Hmm ID But I think the pen is v is very intuitive everybody knows how to use it we dont have to worry UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm PM Yeah yeah ID So I think the pens good ID Its about the best thing UI And o on the topic of the technology it just occurred to me that we actually didnt need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files PM Yeah UI It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer ID Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something you know its useful but I think too many computers are just distracting PM Yeah thats true UI If there had been a fifth that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time ME Good point UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ME Yeah PM Okay ID Um Yep PM I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that um I dont know about anybody else UI Mmhmm UI Yep UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Um what else uh any wh I do Im not really sure what theyre looking for when they say new ideas found PM Um I dont know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ME Is this for the project or Oh yeah UI Well the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other PM Mm UI So thats kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea well you know its kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when youre told you must now work away from your team PM Yeah if we just had uh Mmhmm PM Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah UI Oh yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm PM I really thi i I think maybe if wed like all been working in the one room and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings but There you go UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Hmm PM Um so in closing I havent got my five minutes to go PM Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go PM Wonderful PM Okay um are the costs within the budget yes they are PM And is the project evaluated yes it is PM So now celebrate UI Great UI So it So now we I I dont know ID And we have Ninja Homer PM Well apparently now I write the final report ME Do we know what the other ones are PM What are you guys doing now PM You dunno ME Oh wow UI Hmm PM That is lovely ME Hey yeah I said Ninja Homer UI What did you call it ID Ninja Homer ID See it looks like Homer Simpson but its electronic so its made in Japan UI Huh huh PM So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything UI Logo ID Yeah its just a logo PM Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer right okay UI Huh ID Ninja Homer UI Mm ID The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it UI Mmhmm PM I think its quite nice UI Fashion technology or something ID You can wear Homer you can throw Homer when youre frustrated doh UI Hmm hmm hmm PM Oh no thats cool its got Im kind of Im slightly gutted that we couldnt get plastic and rubber I think that would have been nice UI Hmm ID Its clunky UI Yeah yeah PM Ah well maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money UI Mmhmm ID Oh I did learn something new PlayDoh is useful UI Hmm PM PlayDoh s Really ID No it is it is ID It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing in being creative UI Huh UI Huh ID Cause like you say its something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Like we were playing with the PlayDoh and the ideas came with the PlayDoh rather than with everything else PM Did they ID You might wanna write that down UI Yeah ID Its just Im just fiddling with the PlayDoh and Im going yeah yeah its kinda cool PM Okay PM PlayDoh UI No its true yeah ME Guess Id forgot how good s PlayDoh smells UI Hmm PM Yeah it smells funny doesnt it UI And some PlayDohs are actually I think edible arent they PM Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be yeah ID No all PlayDoh is edible ME I think theyre all nontoxic cause its aimed for like twoyearolds ID Its just wheat its the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh Its helpful to the creative process UI Wow hmm PM Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about PlayDoh UI Huh ID Um it engages all your senses not just your sight but your sense of feel your sense of touch PM Okay UI Yep ID And it helps you to understand dimension as well UI Taste ID I think that thats very helpful because it it starts to pop up whereas on a piece of paper on a computer on a board um even with a three D graphic thing it still it requires a lot of yeah tangible thats a nice word PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Mmhmm yep UI Yeah ME Yeah its not very tangible UI Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm ID It becomes tangible UI Mmhmm PM Tangible PM Okay uh Mm PM I dont know if theres anything else we needed to discuss ID Nope PM That thats about it really PM Just sit still I guess for a little while ID I think we could probably do it here as long as we dont collaborate PM Um Well I dunno PM Um Im sure the little uh the little thingll pop up any minute now ID Can we turn off the microphones PM Yeah yeah if the meetings over then yeah I guess so,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options. The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality. The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process. The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork."
UI Uh making a profit of fifty million Euros ID Alright so twenty five ME Mm kay UI So its go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy ID So yeah Ive The only the only remote controls Ive used usually come with the television and theyre fairly basic UI Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID So uh Mm UI Yeah I was thinking that as well I think the the only ones that Ive seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where theyre yeah ME Yeah the universal ones ME Yeah UI So presumably that might be an idea to put into ID But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features PM Slim ID For sure ME Yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Uh cause I mean what uh twenty five Euros thats about I dunno fifteen Pounds or so ME Mmhmm its about that UI And thats quite a lot for a remote control ID Yeah yeah ME Mm ME Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black ME As you said they come with the TV so its normally just your basic grey black remote control functions so maybe we could think about colour UI Uhhuh UI Mmhmm ME Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least ME Um and as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle you know those things UI Okay UI The the keyrings yeah yeah ME Because we always lose our remote control ID Right UI Okay thats cool PM Uh yeah uh being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market PM What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices PM What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market UI Okay PM So before deciding or before finalising this project we must discuss all these things like and apart from this it should be having a good look also because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player MP three player like any electronic devices ME Okay ME Mm ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM They really want to have something good having a good design in their hands so yes all this ME Yeah UI Okay UI Kay ID Uh what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this UI So were looking for Kay UI Were Sorry carry on ID Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and theres just like a hundred buttons on it or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily ME Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Then you lose it yeah UI Okay ME Kind of um maybe more like a PDA kind of just hand held like cause Yeah UI For for uh remember were trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty ME No I wasnt no sorry I wasnt thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay UI Okay well right well have to um Ill were k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh oh actually no well allocate UI So you do the looking around at other remote controls PM Yeah UI Um if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever and you could look into um basically how how its made IE like how you make it all in one how what sort of materials are available to you whatever UI And obviously other instructions will come from the personal coach ID Right UI Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive ME So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ME Yep ME Okay UI Uh ME Mmhmm UI And you look at competition and design PM Yep UI Cool ME Okay ID Okay UI So we have uh Um ID Wait for emails PM Uh ID Hmm UI Okay groovy UI And no doubt well get um Sorry ME Oh no ME Sorry its okay UI Well get um warnings for next meetings as well ME Okay cool UI Okay UI I shall I cant imagine these are worth much UI Okay PM Hmm UI Fashion into electronic UI Okay,"The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device."
UI Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you however um there are some changes that Ive got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didnt actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television ME Okay ME Okay UI So the all in one idea goes out the window UI And they require that the uh actually Ill get to that at the end point number four um well get what youve got and then we can see what we can adapt from it ME Mmhmm UI So um presentations were you anybody got raring to go PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Raring to go UI Okay UI Good stuff UI Mm PM Um UI Oh I need to plug you in PM So how S Sh do you want me to hold it ME Wow UI Just about ID Its a inspired design UI Uh there we go just screw em on in UI Gonna have to swap them round so now it was function F eight PM So after that PM F eight UI Thats the wee blue one PM f oh sorry F eight UI Blue one F eight UI Should do it good one PM Okay PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Uh me again Rajan the Marketing Expert PM Uh as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out sorry yeah sure UI Hold on sorry UI and if you just click that itll go ahead one at a time PM Yeah yeah PM Uh actually sorry I have to see the other sorry UI Sorry uh PM Yeah thank you PM Uh yes I have to look at the uh market potential for this product uh like consumer likings and everything what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not PM Then Sorry UI P press F five to start it first PM Okay PM Yeah I can okay ID Hmm UI Jesus PM Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey PM A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings what they prefer what they not prefer w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things PM And what we got was we found that if you uh what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market PM Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly PM They are not so good looking PM So we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design uh should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers PM And yes thats wi uh this will definitely this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales PM Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also PM So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls UI Excellent PM Then And the second thing some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want what they operate rather than making it too complicated PM Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it PM Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things PM So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also PM So we have to take care of this fact also PM Then PM Uh it was function I want to go to UI Oh you wanna go back UI Just escape PM Uh escape okay thank you PM Then if we look at this slide uh these are in your shared documents you can see like Uh sorry UI Okay UI Okay ME So sorry I was just gonna say what was the question for this ME Or is are you coming on to that PM Ah t look all the market potential what uh how we should design consu our remote controls what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit enhance our sales ME Okay ME So these percentages are are what PM Yeah these are different age group persons like uh sorry I can open it in another way UI Okay PM Uh yes UI Speech recognition PM If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point like for speech recognition in a remote control PM So we can emphasise on this point also like because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh TV are belong to this age group ME Hmm UI Hmm PM So we should look Yeah UI Were als we were looking at who buys it as well PM We can look at that that factor also so yes UI Uh which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual sort of ME Mm mm PM Yeah PM So and And then Yes UI Fifteen to twe Okay PM I think so PM Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market PM They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control PM So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn PM They need not to have any much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls ME Mmhmm PM So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales PM So um this is all about uh market potential by me ME Mmhmm PM Uh yes th thank you UI Okay thank you UI Um follow on with Helen UI Yeah please ME Yep sure thats cool um Yeah PM Yeah we have to take that out UI Oh so we do yeah PM Sorry UI Fun and games PM Sorry UI Dont know if the cables gonna be long enough PM Uh sorry I have UI I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well PM Brian this one also I PM Yeah UI Okay ME I can turn my computer quickly if thats okay PM Thank you very much Brian PM If you want me to help yeah ME Um yep PM Yeah ME Okay and then what do I press F eight PM Uh F eight UI Function F eight PM Function F eight ME Oh right PM Mm s ME Okay cool PM Its not coming ME Oh PM Function F eight okay PM Yeah ME Yeah ME No signal UI Hmm PM Computer UI There you go PM Computer adjusting yeah ME Okay ME Cool ME Okay and then how do I press the the big one to get it on to the big F five and I press that again to get it off as well do I PM Yeah UI Uh F five UI Um F five and escapell bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing PM Escape ME Okay so um Im the interface design designer User Interface Designer sorry uh Im concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um Im Im also I want to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable its a big concern of ours ME Okay and how do I press n just the next button UI Uh just a left uh left mouse button ME The arrow ME Okay ME So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like what people dislike ME Um and what people fashionable because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our TV I think UI Mmhmm UI Okay ME So um what they like and what they find fashionable UI Kay ME And ergonomics we said um I dont know I havent actually been able to do any of this myself but um maybe that comes up I dont know UI That can come under Arlo as well ME And the findings well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set ME Thats what people want to do UI Uh ME Um so they need to be included um but Ive got some pictures here of some leading ones ME I dont know how to get to them do I press F five is it UI Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar ME escape ME Oh okay cool ME I havent got my glasses on so I hope its this one ME These are two leading um remote controls at the moment UI Uh okay ME You know theyre grey theyve I mean this ones got loads of buttons its hard to tell from here what they actually do and they dont look very exciting at all UI Kay ME Um personally I prefer this one just because its looks easier use its a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff um but there you go thats what were up against and I think we can do much better than that UI Mmhmm ID Of course ME Um hang on UI We hope so ME F five okay sorry ME Personal preferences ME Um well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important um Uhhuh UI Yeah particularly if weve uh there was a bit in Rajs about RSI and things as well PM Yeah ME And um I thought not too edgy and like a box more kind of handheld more um not as uh computery and or organic yeah more organic shape I think UI Organic ME Um simple designs like the last one we just saw not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks UI Mmhmm UI Sales UI Okay ME Um handheld and portable I think is portamint is important because TFT have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen anyway so um Yeah no seven inches isnt that big but um anyway um so handheld and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for TV but as you pointed out people dont actually want that so maybe we forget about that UI Yeah its like a yeah UI Its UI Right UI And also the company want to keep it stuck to the TV for uh to keep down the production time PM Yeah ME Its for one TV oh right okay sure ME And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glowinthedark um which does already e exist but its not very widely used I dont think UI Mmhmm PM Exactly PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Easy finder with the a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because its a pain when you run out of batteries UI Okay UI Yeah ME And I think that yep thats it UI Thats cool ID So uh I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling and uh I was just curious to know have we done any research into how many people can whistle ME Okay ME Mmhmm ID Um or if is that a function we want in the remote ME Um I havent been able to Mmhmm yeah or some sort of voice Yeah UI Um do you have trouble whistling ID I dont but I I know a lot of people do right UI Really UI Ooh ID Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too right UI Yeah I suppose thats true UI Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if its got the voice recognition you could have it just you know where are you PM Yeah ID Thats costly though ID Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um shouting you know uh and then what would the response be ME Mmhmm UI Hmm PM Yeah UI Sounds good ID It beeps back at you or something ME Yeah something ID Okay ID Well uh let me set this up ID So I plug it in press F five ID Function F five UI Function F eight for the um the uh Yeah ID Or function F eight ID Okay ME Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing ID Okay ID I think its uh just to lock it in ID Its got it ME Okay ID Okay ID Um ID So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys um so its good you went first and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others UI Alright UI Lets remember that ID Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products and um he also mentioned that uh the current products dont always match users operating behaviour ID Um a lot of the buttons arent used and uh he mentioned that theyre not fun to use ID And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote there could be a little microphone on it and any noise over a certain threshold um itll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and itll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort UI Mmhmm UI But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold cause if you had a loud movie on youre likely to get it beeping back at you ME Mmhmm ID Oh yeah yeah thats true ME Mmhmm ID Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes ID Um UI Sorry I didnt mean to derail you there ID Yeah well tha thats uh for later down the road um and then as for the user interface it should be trendy um and not computery right so more low tech and not too many buttons ME Mmhmm ID So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss ID Right um and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window ID And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products weve made before which include you know um space craft coffee makers and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train UI Ah is that what that is ID Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these UI Well thats cool UI If you if you can build space craft youll have no problem with a remote control yeah ID Right ME Yeah sure ID So I figured just put em all together ID You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your TV and um as for the user interface problem you know too many buttons PM Hmm ID Give it one button and and its a you know for the the cowboy in all of us I Im not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah its a g I mean you could have a you know a Right UI Right okay ME Well I like that design UI Is that just switches on the speech recognition and its entirely speech operated is it UI Yeah ID So I think I I missed the budget thing it was fifty million Euros UI Yeah ID And we gotta sell twenty five of them ME Yeah not a problem ID Right PM Fifty million was uh prof As a profit ID Okay UI Ah now its fif fifty million Euros weve gotta uh weve g gotta make profit so were making that at twelve and a half Euros a time ID Oh okay so I I mixed those numbers ID Okay ID Well I guess more realistically then we need a product thats got some kinda nifty outer casing cheap plastic uh you know um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less ME Mmhmm ID An energy source whichd probably just be uh your regular batteries um we dont wanna have it Uh UI Okay UI Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea UI Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ME Or a little base station or something UI Yeah ID Yeah yeah we could do that too ID Um I hadnt thought of that ID Yeah ME That might cost more though cause obviously with batteries we dont need to provide well we provide the first batteries but its more its thats cheaper to just provide batteries UI Yeah yeah ID Right UI I mean if you think about these base stations now its essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it so I dont think itd up up the price that much ME A battery in it kinda ID Right so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons but since were a cutting edge company we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product ME Okay ME Okay UI Okay ID Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh just some engineering thing you dont have to worry about UI Okay ID Um so heres you know a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me ID Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know its got a little operating procedure that looks something like that ID And I suppose you all know how it works because weve all used it and we wouldnt be in a company designing remote controls if we didnt know what they were so uh personal preferences I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory uh non volatile memory just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on its not blasting ME Mm ME Mm thats a good idea actually I like the programmable options PM Yeah me too ID Oh okay ID And the uh the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know they take more budgeting um more technical uh expenditure of effort and its also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles UI Right ME Mm kay UI Yeah ID Thats all I got UI Kay thank you very much um Ill take that back ID Ooh thats tight UI Right also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting so didnt manage to forward it on to you it is lets see Ill find it myself um Ta nah ID Okay I dont think we need to screw it in ID Just push it PM Yeah UI We had that um to disinclude teletext um because its become outdated and everybody uses the internet anyway ME Mmhmm UI Um dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind UI Um its only for the television which Im presuming means its for a specific television and um instead of colours and sorta colour options they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design ME Okay ME Corporate colour UI Yellow ME Okay ID Yellow UI I presume UI Um everything all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everythings yellow ME Mmhmm UI And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I dont know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean I guess if youre going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something ME Yeah UI Uh where am I ME Okay UI Okay so we have to decide on which functions were going to actually have ME Kay UI Uh now we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially flat screen interface LCD interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so well pretty much take that one as read ME Mmhmm UI Well use the the basic functions for a television ME Mmhmm UI No teletext UI Um okay hold on ME Although the the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap UI Not enough buttons you mean ME Yeah ME Well Mm UI So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like were just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head that they dont want teletext on it ME On the number of buttons kind of functions and stuff ME Mmhmm okay ME Okay cool UI Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that or maybe theyll send some information about that about um what people whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control PM About cost PM Okay UI Okay um UI So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles weve gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick ID Yeah yeah UI Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling Im getting from little bits of um web chatter that Im getting sent is that theyre quite interested in a TFT display interactive display UI However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didnt like ME Mmhmm mmhmm UI Although I guess if theres a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already sort of Windowsstyle drop down menus or whatever I think maybe thats a bit going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons so it sorta keeps it simple ME Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay UI Um glow in the dark is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ME Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking PM Uh UI Okay UI So Yeah ME Um so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think PM I Uh may I say something about UI Yeah PM Uh actually I think its really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote in the room PM But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time ME Often lost s was that yeah UI Lost yeah ME Mmhmm PM But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark ME Mmhmm PM Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales so we should take it into consideration also UI Thats cool ME Mmhmm mmhmm UI Thats cool UI Okay cool UI Um speech recognition I take it I dont Ive I know of no products um that use speech recognition well ID Well hmm ID Oh its Theyre act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it ID You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh BBC one and it goes to that channel UI Really ID Yeah it didnt work very well though because of this noise interference problem ME Mm UI Mmhmm ID They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to BBC one UI Yeah or a yeah an advert an advert for BBC two on BBC onell switch the channel for you kinda thing ID Right right and so there was a lot of this youd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden itd itd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something but if you can work around that that noise problem Right ME Mmhmm UI Mm ME Kay UI Uhhuh ME Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually but what about um something thats built into the TV um that you can press and itll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we cant hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep UI Ah thats a good idea UI So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly ME If you find if y Yeah ID Right and then it would do just you know uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise ID What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the TV speaker or not a remo Im sorry a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote cause you cant um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their TVs ME Mm ME Yeah thats the only thing yeah ID But yeah then you have like the little se separate module by the TV speaker which Right and then the remote control would know um whats being produced by the television UI Right UI That we should just stick on yeah ME That comes with our remote control UI Yeah ME Yeah UI And thats a sort of basic RF kind of frequency so itll be cheap ID Right right ME Mmhmm ID Right right ID Um ID Yeah thats certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again ID If you do have this sorta speech interface to it you dont even need to find it ID You just say you know um whatever you whatever you want the remote for you know to change the channel or to uh turn the TV on and off you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if its within you know within hearing range UI Uhhuh ID And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that youve no idea where it is and it would still do its job ME That could also be built into the TV though which might make our remote control a bit obsolete UI Yeah ID Well hopefully were uh were ahead of the curve UI It might do us out of a job ME Yeah okay UI Um Okay UI I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing UI Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that so I th yeah and expense and the time ME Mm ID Hmm ME And the expense ME Mmhmm UI So I think if were going to go well I mean like the thing about the theres the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if youre also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen ME Mm UI Um but I guess not I thin well just well just pretend thats not a problem UI Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material UI Is that Contrast contra well ID Um ME Maybe not even all of it cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line thats kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour ID Mm ID Yeah no th the materials cheap but its just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know and then uh if youre if youre sitting in the dark for too long it uh it wont glow any more ME Mmhmm UI Yeah okay UI So if its dow its d uh yeah UI Or if its down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine ID Right ME Mmhmm ID Right UI Um Okay well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially um if were gonna have to if were gonna have the logo on as well bright yellow logo in our our um slogan ME Yeah cause what I thought main Slogan yeah UI Uh then you know theyre gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well of the glow in the dark material just as gimmickyness ME Right ME Mmhmm ME Cause yeah that w more than finding it that was more like you know if youre watching a film in the dark you can um still see the remote control UI Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Alright so n sorta if if if were gon if were gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback sort of remote finder then that kinda stuffs that one out then ME That was more of a a gimmick UI Do you think ME Mm UI Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then ME Yeah unnecessary UI Okay ME Yeah UI Um okay so scratch that UI Uh so weve got do we want to go with the TFT idea or the is that far too expensive ID Um yeah were getting a lot of features now I I think Yeah UI Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean its uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself UI Um Mmhmm ID Well I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot you know they get thrown around theres a good chance the the TFT screen would break or uh get damaged ME Mm ID Theyre pretty fragile ME So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a TFT screen UI Okay UI Um no I mean that was going on ravs uh Rajs sort of um marketing research I guess UI Um Uh So well stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have UI Um UI So thats sort of included in your submodule kind of stuff um Uh you were finding out about teletext ID Yeah mm UI If you could find out that uh Um I think were gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive no PM Yeah PM Totally it takes cheap speech recognition she they wi Yeah ID Oh ME Yeah you think so ID Oh no its its much cheaper than the TFT its just a microphone and some some integrated circuits UI Oh right okay UI Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right okay ID And itd itd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like a Okay UI Uh well that kind of takes back the RF the RF remote sort of idea as well ME Okay UI Um UI Five minutes UI Okay UI Decisions UI Uh votes lets vote UI Who wants TFT UI Noone does UI Excellent so well go with speech recognition yeah ME Mmhmm thats cool UI Um speech recognition limited buttons organic design ME Um if its not too expensive s I think its a good gimmick UI And what else was I thinking of that I havent written down and therefore fallen out my head programmability PM Glow in dark UI Uh Uh o okay ID Yeah UI And also integrating the remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan ME Mmhmm UI Okay so UI Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if theyre not already in there as well UI So it just helps me summarize them ID Yeah yeah PM Here PM Sure UI And um Ill put any Im Im putting anything I do in there anyway so uh Uh pro uh project documents ME And where is it sorry UI On AMI scenario controller ID So it should be when you save on your desktop so it goes save as or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again ME Oh PM Uh it is in shared documents UI Where am I PM Projoct uh projector UI Project documents yeah its on your desktop as well ID Again ID All the way to the top yeah thats up to desktop ID Right and then project documents ME Okay cool PM Hmm PM It is not giving anything PM Shared documents UI And I will tr getting strings of um information Ill try and forward any specific to anybody in particular as soon as I get them now rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting and then the meeting turned up so I did ME Okay ID Mm ID Did you get my email ID Okay ID Just making sure ME Okay UI So Okay ME What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material its a bit more bouncy like you said they get chucked around a lot ME Um a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls UI Yeah ME The rubber rather than Mmhmm mmhmm ID Yeah UI More sort of um fleshlike than plasticky sort of ID Wow PM Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldnt be too harmful PM So whatever material we use it should be yeah UI Oh no ethics thats gonna cost us money PM So we have to safety point of view also we have to take care UI Okay safety ME Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it wont be as it wont as have many sharp corners as that so thats something good um I dunno I mean Thats a good idea UI Yeah UI It sme smells good for children ID We could go comp yeah PM Yeah ID We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball ID And its got the thing on the inside ID And theres no buttons at all its always on and just yell at it and it works UI That sounds yeah its gonna have to be its gonna be have a big yellow foam ball yeah sorry ID And then ch children will love it ME Interesting ID Oh yellow yellow ball ME Yeah d with the colour um does it have to be all yellow do you know ID Right UI Please God no UI Um ME No UI Well I wouldnt th I mean my reaction to an allyellow remote control wouldnt be anything other than horror so I think just having it surrounding the logo ME Yeah PM Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it ME Having a little bit ME Okay cool ME Mm mm UI Yeah ME Mmhmm okay ME Cool UI And Ill see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it UI We put we put fashion into Whoops its not working UI Cant believe Ive forgotten it UI We put the fashion in electronics ME Oh yeah thats a good one that UI I bet thatll catch on well ME Yeah so UI Okay any last worries queries PM Yeah ID Twelve thirty UI Okay UI S s I know what youre thinking PM Hmm UI Okay then lunchtime yay PM Thats good UI Okay that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one UI This is quite fun actually ME Wow ID Mm ME Has anybo oh UI I really dont Yeah yeah ME Has anybody pressed okay it vibrates ME Its pretty cool ID Yep PM Check here UI Wow youve your first page UI I was just writing really big ME Yeah got small writing ID Yeah Ive been using up the pages ME I dont wanna waste it UI Ive finished the meeting now UI Oh everybody needs k questionnaire ID Another questionnaire,"The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design."
UI Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time UI So switching over Ive just left uh my first two screens ME Mmhmm UI Um I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time ME Okay ME Cool UI Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ME Mm um UI N No ME No I dont think so UI Okay cool ID No UI Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj PM Yeah PM Hi me Raj again PM Uh in this meeting I Im going to discuss about the trend watching uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this PM So we have to look on this PM First of all methodology PM The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit PM So what are our findings PM In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel uh good PM So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls PM So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor because this factor is twice as important the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor PM So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls ME The last one is the most important one is it PM No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile the it should have a fancy outlook the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good it should have a fancy look and foo feel good ME Oh sorry ME Okay ME Okay PM The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative PM We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are PM So it uh should be technologically innovative like glowinthedark or speech recognition something like that PM So that indicates our technological advancement ME Mmhmm PM And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use like it shouldnt be too much co complicated there shouldnt be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control it shouldnt be too complicated uh like this way ME Mmhmm PM And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language something PM So that they could know how to use these remote controls PM When we did uh f fashions uh recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah ME Sorry ME I was just reading fruit and vegetables ME Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that PM Y yeah uh yeah we have to because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes shoes and everything with fruits and vegetables because the g world is now changing its trend towards organic becoming more and more organic becoming Yeah ME Okay ME Yeah ID We should make a big sponge lemon and then itd be it would be yellow ME Yeah PM So Yeah ME Th thats very good ID Its Yeah PM So something like that we we should do ME Glowinthedark ME Okay PM And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look ME Well thats good ID Mm ME Thats what we kind of predicted anyway PM Yeah PM Yeah PM So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it ME Okay PM So that should also be taken into consideration ME Okay PM So these are my views ME Okay ME Okay the spongy not real spongy you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff PM So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah ME Okay ME Quite disposable ME Okay PM Cause we It shouldnt be have any harm to the environment also because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration so we dont want to have any harm to the society so So thats all ME Oh okay UI Alright okay ME Uhhuh ME Okay UI Fashion ME Cool UI Mm kay UI Fruit and veg well there you go UI Just what I think of when I think of a remote control ME Mm ME A remote control ME Yeah ME And were there any factors that werent important in the survey that they said we dont want PM S uh we didnt find out any such point ME Or was it just Okay PM Uh yes there could be but we couldnt find out any so Yeah UI Mmmmmmmm ME Cool UI Mmmmmmmmmm ME F what is it ME Um UI Function F eight ME yeah UI Hmm ME Okay ME No signal PM Oh no ME Is that ID No its got its got it PM Yeah uh yeah uh yeah PM Yeah ME Okay and then F five right UI Excuse me UI Uh yeah ME Okay ME Um okay so the interface concept um ME Yeah ME The interface specification what people um how they interact with it basically I think ME Um so the method we looked at existing designs what are the whats good about them whats bad about them um I looked at their flaws so were going to look at their flaws everything ME Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good so a bit of imagination UI Mm kay ME Uh the findings Ive got some pictures to show you as well UI either ME Yeah PM Hmm ME Okay so most remote controls use graphical interface where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something UI Uh okay ME Um and we also found that theres inconsistent layout which makes it confusing ME So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something I think people find that importantcause then its easy to use UI Right okay UI Yeah ME And weve got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you ME Do I press Escape F five UI Excellent UI Uh no just escape should uh Kay ME Or just Escape okay ME Um oh I still havent got my glasses on ME Yeah okay ME So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones ID Wow ME Ill just walk you through them ME This one is a voice recognition ME And thats the kind of idea were going for UI Looks pretty complicated ME Theres um an LCD thing which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us UI Right okay ME This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which Yeah UI Mmhmm like the middle button UI Okay ME Um and But Im not exactly sure how youd use that like would the computer come Uhhuh thats like the LCD one is it UI Ah its kinda like scrolling uh right well if I s if Im thinking of the right one Ive got the same thing in front of my monitor you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require you press the middle of the scroll UI Right okay ME But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side ME But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen UI Yeah presumably ME I think thats what that is PM Yeah ME So these are just a few ideas ME Again thats just quite boring shape grey looks quite spaceagey but too many buttons I think on that one UI Yeah looks like uh looks like something out of a jet ID Uh it looks threatening ME Yeah it does look kind of dangerous ID It looks like yeah PM Hmm ME Um this one I thought was really cool ME Its w its got the programmability function that we talked about ME You can put it in there its for your kids and its quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool UI Okay ME And thats really easy to use bright so I like this one lot for our design ME I think something like that would be good ID Wow UI Yeah I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um Ive seen a lot of them with the the cover missing ME Of course yellow ME Right yeah UI So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever ME Yeah thats true ME Yeah ME Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something ME And this one the oversized one I dont know about you but I think its a bit too gimmicky ME I dont think that will sell very well UI Yeah UI I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something is it ME I guess so ME I dont know ME I think thats a bit Yeah exactly UI Strange ID Then d blind dont watch TV UI No they do they do UI They listen to it ID They do UI Yeah ME Yeah ME And um this one is just pointing out ME I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape UI Right okay ME So that could thats a bit confusing ME Um but the buttons on this I think are its just showing you how you can have different different um buttons ME They dont have to be all the same ME So thats quite cool ME Um UI Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway dont they ME Yeah exactly ME Um F five ME Yes ME So there are some of the findings ME So we need to combine those ones um and Ive just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in UI Brilliant UI Thats handy ME Um yeah it is just in time very handy ME Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good ME Its you program it like you say record um and then play and then record play machine and stuff like that so thats And its much Yeah UI Okay ME So thats quite cool ME Uh personal preferences just some imagination the raised symbols I thought were good the LCD it does look smart but I think maybe for our budget do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah ID The LCD and the other stuff uh I think ME And the speech recognition cause I think were definitely going for the speech recognition are we PM But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more but they want the quality they want f fancy look they want some new design something new ME Uhhuh UI Okay ME Uhhuh PM Uh yeah ME But our budget weve Yeah UI Its still its still got to get within our twelve fifty you know PM Yeah PM So even if we increase our cost little bit within uh some limits and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market ME Uhhuh ME Okay ME Im not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost UI Okay ID Ben bana Hmm UI Yeah UI I cant see tha Although th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the LCD technology now so that youve got your LCD TVs and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white I guess it just doesnt look funky enough ME The LCD ME Yeah ME No UI Um but I mean like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour LCD screens w I ju I mean I wouldnt know about the costs of them ME Yeah ME S Uhhuh ID But uh price price not withstanding um is it too complicated is it gonna be too much just overload UI Twelve fifty PM And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be on LCD s screen there will be different frent icons they can just click ok okay whatever they wa Ah yeah ME Yeah thats the thing because Yeah UI Possibly ID But but the thing is when you use a remote control you never look at it right UI Yeah ID Youre looking at the TV and and its uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable UI Yeah ME Thats true yeah ME And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use so I think Im not sure about the LCD UI Right ME Its a its great its a good idea but for our budget and for the thing were trying to go for eas easy to use its not the thing we should go for I think ME Childfriendly I thought this was good as you pointed out the um the bit it often goes missing especially with children but its a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape I think UI Yeah UI Well I mean we could make a Yeah ME Yeah I know carrot UI Well si since were going for the uh the k the sort of company colours I think your lemon wasnt that far s And if it doesnt work you know weve just made a lemon ID Okay ID The the lemon ME Yeah ID Well what are the options ME But we dont want it to be Yeah ME Um the childfriendly yeah ME Easy to use it seems quite easy to use ME I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff UI Mmhmm ME I think thats a good idea to go for UI I like I like the colourful buttons as well ME Yeah ME And the mouse one I thought it was a good idea because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing UI Yeah ME Um UI I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use ME Yeah ME S yeah ME So theyd be able to use that um as I said I think i Id presume it would come up on the screen UI Yeah ME Um so there you go UI And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the TV maker so Kay ME Yeah ID Oh ME So thats um the user interface design ME So okay Ill take this out now then ID Okay ID Um so I guess there are a lot of options that were gonna have to choose from among and Ill Ill give you the uh I guess technical considerations for those ME There you go UI Yeah looks like it ME Mm UI Uh Yeah I was just thinking the self same thing ID And Im gonna use the whiteboard just cause we havent used it ID Right ID So the way Im gonna do this is uh were gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it and then well throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget ID So uh yeah looking inside a a very simple remote control UI Magic man ID Um this is what they sent me ID Kay ID Heres uh the competition I suppose ID Um you open it up theres a circuit board inside um and theres a a chip a processor the TA one one eight three five which um receives input from the buttons and ch Right its very theyre very cheap remote UI Mmhmm UI So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it ID This remote costs nothing you know ID Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier which is made of some transistors and amplifiers opamps and then that gets sent to the uh to the LED light which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television ME Mmhmm UI Right ID Oh here it is ID Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control because it it defines the uh R Um no I mean this is a very old one so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make UI Okay UI So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or UI They gotta be Almost a keyring ID Right ID So this is what we need to have for certain ID Um UI Okay ID So you know as we said we got the outer casing which we have to decide you know whats it gonna be um the board we have to use basically uh the same setup processor um well probably use the more advanced processor than they had amplifier and transmitter are all standard ID Um so for the casing uh this an email I got from our manufacturing team uh you know we have a bunch of options from wood titanium rubber plastic whatnot um latex doublecurved curved ID So lots of choices what do we think UI Kay ID Uh or sponge I guess isnt on there right UI Well ME Mm ID Organic sponge UI Well I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it doesnt it ME Im not sure about the sponge UI Um Yeah ID Uh yeah its very elasticy for sure ME Yeah UI And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther thats also f sorta relatively cheap to cast ME Yeah ID Um ID Yeah so Okay so here are a a plastic uh latex Oh right UI Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ME I like the rubber the stress balls I think you know that could be a bit of a gimmick like its good to hold and Yeah UI Oh right okay UI I dont know what that stuff is ID So something with give to it UI Yeah ID Okay ME And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around ID And and the colour is yellow right ME Yeah y yellow incorporated yeah UI Or at least incorporating yeah ID Yellow okay ID Um UI I mean I forgot i were sort of uh I dont know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mmhmm ME I think Mm ME Yeah the buttons w like cause theres gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if were having buttons actually I don Yeah ID Mm kay ID So yellow for the body and then what colour for the buttons UI Um UI Um I quite like the multicoloured buttons myself ID So multicoloured buttons ME You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red and stuff like that yeah UI Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multicolour so it it doesnt look too childish perhaps ME Makes it easy to use ME Yeah thats true because that blue one did look quite hardish UI Yeah ID Okay UI Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well UI I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean doublecurved sounds good to me if were talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use a bit comfier you know ID Okay ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Yeah ID Mm kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly ID Maybe double What about a banana ME Like uh an hour glass kind of figure is that what youre thinking of or just like a Its not Yeah UI Yeah its uh yeah that thatd be thats sort of comfortable to hold easy to hold so you dont drop it ID Yeah ME We could make novelty remote controls ID Okay like we could have a big banana shaped remote control cause its yellow fruit right UI Well yeah I mean like Yeah yeah UI Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip ME Yeah ME But then how would you point it UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ME How would you point it ID Oh i it doesnt matter which end you point I guess ME What Yeah ID We could have a little LEDs on each end UI They only cost pennies PM Yeah I appreciate this idea because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables the peoples choices PM That what our data shows that so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables like people uh now Spongy UI Huh ME y Im Im not sure about the banana idea ID So a spongy banana re Yeah UI Um ME Rubber banana UI I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe ME Okay ME Yeah ID Okay okay ME I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape ME And what else did you say about fashions ME What was trendy UI S And sponginess ID See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a itd be s axially symmetric ME And spongy yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Maybe yeah UI Huh ME Like whats whats that I dont even know the name of it some kind of you know where its like looks like a little snowman kind of thing ME I dont know the name of that ID So itd look like this kinda ME Yeah thats what I was thinking ID Like a gourd almost or a squash of some sort UI Uh ME Yeah maybe thats what they are ME Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah ID Yeah and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say you know it transmits from this end UI Yeah why the hell not UI Lets thatll make us fifty million Euros ME I dont know ME What do you guy What do you think UI Um UI Well I guess its kind of dra uh you dont necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape yeah ME No ID Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah then only we can relate it with something UI Yeah we can relate it by advertising or Yeah PM Yeah PM Exactly ID Okay so doublecurved singlecurved what do we feel PM Or we can do something we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey let the public choose what they want ME Uhhuh UI Theres a good man ID Okay UI Theres a good idea ME Okay ID Okay um I guess since youre the marketing guy PM Yeah sure ID Well uh Okay we could do that PM I will be happy to do that ID Um ME Okay ME And buttons would did we say ME Uh different shapes of buttons UI Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions you know up and down uh play stop ME Mm ID Okay so so buttons UI Theyve got I mean theyve got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used ID Okay just like that ME Yeah UI Thats cool UI I like it ID Okay UI Um ID With the scrollwheel or no ME Yeah what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition UI Uh speech recognition I think so we need a microphone presumably ID Okay uh I could put the microphone here ME Mmhmm ID Okay theres the microphone UI Yeah ID Where should I put the microphone UI I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ME Yeah Im not sure ME Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration I think UI Glad were not doing this for real ME Um yeah I can no Im not sure ID Okay well we can do some user test with scrollwheels right ME I couldn Yeah UI Yeah ID Okay UI And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of subcentrally so its Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay ID So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or Kay theres the mic ME Yeah UI So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it if its gonna be voice recognition ME Thats cool ID Um n well we can Whoops UI Oops ID Um UI Um ME So lets not use the whiteboard any more ID Yeah ID Um UI Upsidaisy ID Oops sorry ID Okay ME And uh so what else was there ME Um the What about the glowinthedark thing the strip around it ME Are we just gonna leave that UI I s I still like it UI Um but thats me ME You still like it ME Cause weve got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system ID Right UI Yes or maybe its just going a bit uh too far UI I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes ME Cause um it could Yeah UI Um dont wanna sort of overkill ME Especially with yellow ME Mm ME I dunno ID Hmm UI Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing UI Do we want to go for buttons at all do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends its a fruit ME Then you put it in the fruit bowl UI Yeah you know and then you just tal I mean like everybodys got fruit bowl in front of the telly ID They can work from a You dont have to hold it ID Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Um ID I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers you know they have uh fruits all round them ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Make them make them think of fruit yeah ID Now just make sure they dont eat the remote PM Yeah UI I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh I dunno an apple ME Yeah do we need buttons ME Mm UI Then its just apple so sort of Uh yellow apples though Hmm ID Yeah ME I quite like the shape ME I quite like the design of that uh cause that could sit on its own and its quite got a quite steady base UI Yeah UI Okay yeah thats good UI Groovy ID Okay ME Um and as we say we n we dont wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know ID But yeah But yeah about the speech thing it doesnt have to be hand held or close UI Yeah ID It can sit at a distance and pick it up still UI Yeah ME Okay UI So I mean like you could actually Yeah gives you the options PM Or we can we can do one thing we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM So whatever people want like if somebody want it in banana shape we will put that casing onto that mobile phone okay it will look l Uh yeah ME Mmhmm UI So a selection of casings ME Yeah cause you said about disposable didnt you PM In that w S s sorry UI It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles yeah ME You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that like have a choice PM Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of we need not to have a full cover we will just have a half of cover okay ME Yeah PM If somebody wants it i in banana shape we will fit banana shape casing onto that so it will give a banana shape look ME Yeah PM If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that we will put we will put apple shape casing on that PM It will give apple shape look ME Okay PM So in that way you can have any that means whatever you want without uh yeah ME Okay ME We still need the buttons in the same places thought dont we PM Yeah button will be on the upper side buttons will be the on the upper side UI You can standardise those I mean ME Oh thats the other side PM Yeah buttons will be on the upper side lower side we will just put the casing so half of that will be look the Yeah not not the upper side ME Oh okay ME Oh half a fruit ME Oh okay okay PM So from lower you can it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look whatever ME Okay okay PM So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything we will just design casings fruit shape ME Okay ID Yeah yeah UI I think tho I think if youre gonna have a facia then youd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons cause when if you think about it if theyre wanting it cause they want to look at it if theyre using it and what they want to look at is facing away from them PM And Yeah ME Mm mm UI It doesnt really You know cause thatd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldnt be able to see it unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down ME Yeah UI And youve got the facia and you can just talk at the Maybe ME Mmhmm ID Okay um so Yeah s I guess we decided on material right UI So youve narrowed it down to half a dozen options ID So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel and the colours we got down and the shape maybe well just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Well um because Well I Im not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah w I think wh wha would were trying to get to twenty five thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said UI Okay so we stick with what weve got there ME They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick but something ergonomically shaped and organic like good to hold based on fruits and natural things like that because al already were going a bit gaudy with the yellow you know UI Mm kay UI Mmhmm ME I mean we could make it nice pale yellow UI Well its kind of gotta be our companys yellow ME Okay ID Okay ME Okay UI So again I mean like we could have uh I mean we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour but have kinda going round yeah ME Yeah ME Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with you said the logan the slogan ID Mm ME Because Yeah UI Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together UI So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Uhhuh ID Mmhmm UI W sort of Uh Its I think its basically the more you move i it its got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it ID Great ID Um as for the energy source um you know almost every remote control uses just batteries but we dont have to be limited by that ID We can use a handdynamo ID Um I dont know what that means we crank it ID Right its like those watches that you c So this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab you can shake it if its out of power UI Uh yeah ME Oh a d a dynamo ME Yeah ME Yeah like with those watches that you kind of twist UI Yeah I like that yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah thats quite cool ID Okay ID So if it if its not working I guess peoples natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing UI Okay PM But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo tha these type of cells UI You shake it and scream at it UI Yeah ME Yeah it is yeah PM Because then people have to well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah to mo Yeah UI It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated PM Yeah because most of the people Yeah UI Then if its just sitting on the Okay okay ID Right ME Yeah then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah ME Thats true ID Okay UI Right um what are the other options ID Uh theres solar power PM Uh solar power will w also not be a good idea because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah ID Um UI Yeah ID Yeah UI Im Im with uh Raj on that I think you know Ive got Ive got no Ive got a north facing house theres not really ever sun coming in my window ID Okay so probably just Mm PM Yeah PM What we w yeah ME But w like just normal light PM I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea UI Oh thats true PM They can they can recharge it UI I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a yeah having a rechargeable stand so that not only it doubles as a stand but um for using it as uh recharging it but also for using it as sound recognition ME And were a very environmentally friendly company arent we as well PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah ID Kay ME Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing UI Yeah that kind of thing PM Yeah thats Yeah exactly ID Okay ID So uh a rechargeable battery UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Okay UI Rechargeable ID Um the user interface the buttons I guess we talked about this already ME Mm UI Whats chip on print ID Um UI Whats Sorry never mind ID Hmm ID Uh th the uh the electronics um basically the more features we add um Oops this one ID So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost as you can expect ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Um ID But uh I think we can keep it all under budget ID So uh yes so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some breakthrough ME Mmhmm ID So just in time UI Yeah and if we if were just having buttons and the speech then were getting our cheapest option of chipping ME Just in time ID Right right UI Thats good UI Uh woah ID Yeah and keeping the LCD screen out UI Okay were were kind of uh were kind of um Excuse m Ive just deleted that whole thing UI Um were kind of running out of time so if you could Uh UI Was that you UI Um that was your bits covered I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next ID Huh ID Oh yeah that was that was it PM Uh excuse me Bri You just touch the pad yeah UI Um yeah ID So control F eight right UI Oh yeah ME Yeah mine seems to have turned off ME I cant do anything UI And I just touch the pad ME No PM No UI Its actually shut down ME Its on but theres nothing on the screen UI Okay um now what we have uh our next meetings in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay ID Try uh flipping the screen down ID Kay ID Oh I get to do it too UI Yeah ME Cool UI Its you guys ID Oh neat UI Yeah UI So um you know I mean luckily we chose a nice simple shape ME Yeah ID Yeah yeah ME Mm UI Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches ME Okay ID Okay PM Thats great ID Save everything to the shared documents is that right UI Uh yeah I hope I can recover this cause Ive accidentally deleted it ME Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Which doesnt really help me much ME I think Ive saved mine already UI Yeah can you save that uh send that last one again please Raj as I still cant find it on the Okay PM Yeah PM Uh it was under a different name PM I will show you in shared documents PM Uh working components PM Oh you didnt get that UI No PM I will send new UI Okay thank you PM Uh Ill put it in shared documents again UI Um yeah Project Project Documents PM Project documents sorry I put it in the shared documents UI Uh right thats thats the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents PM Uh yeah UI Project Documents is on the um desktop PM Right thats great PM But I cou cant open that because it w asks uh for some username or password ID Oh UI Really PM Ill show you ID Uh these lapel mics are trouble PM Ts Sorry UI Oh right I think um Hold on PM Uh UI Yeah I dont know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda UI S Um presumably theres clay somewhere UI Um UI Four PM Yeah thats great UI Whoops UI Light light please UI Light UI Right there you go PM Yeah th thank you UI Yeah quite UI And were using this our basic chip set so its all good PM Oh sorry ID Are we done with our meeting PM Uh excuse me Brian UI Um I think were almost done yeah PM You have to keep your pen separate because I used your pen ID Yeah UI Oh oops UI Sorry man PM S Hmm UI Uh okay still didnt manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and Uh UI Apples UI Mmmmmmmmmm UI Kay so we came up with that thats okay UI Whats supplements UI Supplements UI Uh uh UI See ME Cool ME Fun UI I shoulda something like that UI If I kn see I I knew that UI I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape UI Just for cruelty ME Yeah PM Hmm ME Star fruit UI I wonder if they mean like literally make it sort of buttons and everything PM So sh should Should we leave now Brian ME No ME Oh yeah we can do buttons PM Or we are going to discuss something UI Um UI Uh no I think thats us our discussion over unless anybodys got questions or confusions cause Im confused ME No Im good PM Yeah UI Huh ME Okay PM Excuse me UI Um uh well probably get questionnaire in a minute its a There we go ME Mm PM Sorry PM Thank you PM Yeah UI Warning finish meeting now PM So UI I rounded it up far too fast UI Um UI Where are we going UI My Documents thats not what I want UI My Project Documents UI There we go,"The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype."
ME Okay ID Okay almost there UI Okay UI Well sta Ill use the PowerPoint I guess UI How was that was that fun ME Mm ID Yeah yeah ME Very fun UI Okay UI Uh oh Ive forgotten to mail you the minutes but I will do ID Okay UI Upsidaisy PM Hmm UI Um Um we Yeah PM E excuse me I forgot my copy UI Alright okay yeah UI Hes gonna get his pen ME Oh right ME Okay UI Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ID Yeah theres good news UI Uh we have budget problems ID Oh ME Mm ID Oh ID Cutbacks UI Im afraid youre all sacked UI Oops UI I dont even have this on ID Hmm UI Okay have you got a presentation to make ID Okay PM No not mine yet UI No UI Okay so its just your your show ID Oh ID Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see ID Yeah ME Okay ME Sure ID Okay ME We made three for you UI Three UI Oh ME Um ones based on the banana ones based on the tomato and the other one is st Look UI Tomato UI What tomato UI I dont recall a tomato ME Oh yeah well yeah we had v some red left over ME So UI Ah I see okay ME Okay so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one or as mm few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition UI Mmhmm ME The yellow there is the um the slogan yeah that we need to incorporate its very simple UI Logo UI Okay brilliant ME If you do need buttons you can flip it over and theres some there um but mainly its speech recognition UI Okay UI Okay so the buttons would be like you know individual users or Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there UI Alright okay ME Mm Im not sure about that ME Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier UI Right ME Yeah you guys can have a look at that if you want UI Thats groovy PM Yeah PM Uh can I have Oh sorry s Mmhmm UI Well I like the feel of it I like the feel of it ME Yeah sure ME Um that one is Oh no its delicate UI At Oh dear ME Thats thats already got its stand that one ME Thats it stand UI Alright okay ME It does also lie flat but thats the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand UI Okay brilliant mm ME Um the black on the back is the slogan UI Okay nice and obvious there if its standing up I guess yeah ME Uh yeah that Well we did think of that ME Yeah if its standing up its its on there but also were gonna have the company name on the front which is the little black kind of line in the middle UI Oh right okay brilliant UI Like that from its centre ME So um and thats the um transmit the LED thing ME These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down ME We n were werent sure about putting them there because um i its it kind of could get bashed UI Where youre yeah uh were youre holding it kind of Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Well if you hold it you can you all can hold it is it does actually feel quite ergonomic if youve got small hands UI Yeah ID Mm ME Um obviously I dont think thats real sized UI Okay ME It would have to be a bit bigger UI Yeah okay UI Yeah scale model yeah ME Okay ME Um thats a speaker at the top so you can speak into it like a little walkietalkie as well for speak recognition UI Mmhmm ME Um and um then the buttons ME Yeah kind of selfexplanatory just buttons whenever you need them ME Tried to keep it simple ME Oh thats the charging base prongs at the bottom ME We used those ME And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one UI Alright excellent ME Its not in the traditional place but um its quite an obvious place UI Okay UI No UI Its out of the way as well I suppose so UI Excellent ME So there we go and and um we have the bananabased one too ID Oh yeah yeah UI Yep ID This one is uh I suppose for the younger audiences UI Okay so so Barney the banana ID A a more friendly type of Right right ID Its to uh induce more television watching I suppose or Yeah UI Ah excellent just what we need ME Yeah ID Say it for the camera UI Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana ME Mmhmm ID Right right UI Cool yeah UI Well nice to have uh options at least ME Yeah ID Yep UI Kay and Oh there are issues oh there are issues ME So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh ID It wont stand ID Just let it lie down it wont stand UI Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance UI Uh lets just enter in the um evaluation criteria UI Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons uh its gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros PM Mm ME Oh UI So we have to rea Sorry Ive accidentally highlighted somehow Um ID Whats on the uh on the left UI There we go ID Okay UI Oh god why is it doing that ME Ooh UI There we go UI So basically um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape but just have it flattened ME Mmhmm ME More like a traditional remote control UI Um UI Yeah I mean its already got a kind of cool shape so but it wouldnt have to be curved sort of in and out ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm UI And by doing so Oh no hold on UI Doesnt save us quite as much UI I dont know whats going on with this again ID W why is the uh double curved two of them UI Oh good point PM And double curve on both sides UI Um PM Curve PM Yeah this is doublecurve no UI Thats sort of curve in and out PM This is doublecurve ID Is i Mm PM It This one is single curve PM Cause this is single curve this is curved on both sides PM So doublecurve UI No I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward ME Like an S shape ME Okay UI Okay I might be wrong though PM Like this one curve on this side one curve on that side UI I dont think that counts as a curve I think thats just a shape PM Hmm PM Hmm ME Okay UI A curvature is like the this case PM Maybe ME Okay ID Cause thats the uh the biggest expense there right UI Yeah and why why Ive got it two I dont know I cant seem to select any more however ID got two of them Okay ID Well we can work around that um Cut things out ME Mmhmm UI Right UI No ID But you think it should be one UI Its meant to be one yeah I dont know why I put two in there but um Hold on till I find it I think this shift button might be stuck again ID Okay UI No maybe the shift buttons stuck in ID Yeah UI Um okay so that would take away three which would give us Oh thats fine PM Mm PM Should Uh you can do one thing ID Yeah so were We should fire the accountants UI Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty ME Cool ME Cool UI Um We cou Oh not quite have the scrollwheel unfortunately ME So we could even add something UI What ID Fire the accountants ID Ah yeah we could add things ID Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell where youre starting from and then use the arrow keys UI Yeah ID Does that work UI Yeah I know that just extends it as well ID No mm UI I dont know PM You just select one box outsi yeah this box PM Then move it with the help of this Okay UI It One of the buttons is sticking I dont know PM Just uh just uh Okay just a minute PM Okay PM No input like this PM Shift PM No its not UI No its cause the uh the shift buttons stuck or something PM Yeah its not working ID Is it the other shift button maybe PM Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa UI No thats fine UI Um weve worked out what it would be anyway ID Did you try both shift buttons ID It could be the other side UI Yeah UI Cancel UI Piss off ID Thats too bad UI Oh well never mind UI Um UI Right so thats finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add UI Um Well I suppose thats our thats thats our design that weve got ME Well maybe we could add something but maybe if What do you th Were trying to save money so ME Yeah if were happy with the design theres no point in spending money if we dont have to UI So Yeah ME But if there is anything you think weve missed out there then you know feel free to add it ME Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front because its not in an ideal place right now UI Yeah yeah UI Well thats thats uh Okay so project evaluation UI We have under twelve Euros fifty UI Project process how do we think that went UI Are we happy ID Oh ME Mm ID Yeah I think we have a a winning product UI Okay UI Evaluation UI Oh weve been writing this up for m months ME I think it went quite smoothly UI Uh room for creativity were we happy with that ME W I think we were very creative UI No I mea I think it means sort of individually ME Oh right okay UI Yes no maybe ME Mmhmm UI Okay UI Groovy UI So uh were just gonna UI Uh yeah okay UI Teamwork UI Leadership sorry ID Great leadership ME Excellent leadership UI Thank you very much UI Youre all get youre all getting a raise UI Uh teamwork UI I thought went well ID Yeah yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah everyone got enough input I think UI Yeah UI Uh and well means yeah PM Yeah we Yeah UI The technical stuff was brilliant UI Lets buy more ME Yeah UI Uh Right UI Um I dont know what new ideas found means to be honest ID These pens are are neat though PM Yeah these are new ideas like glowinthedark or something like that PM We discussed all the new ideas but of course we couldnt reach any proper goals we couldnt use these but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this ME Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM These are new ideas we And new shapes everything ME Yeah UI Mm kay PM At le Yeah UI Groovy UI So just general thumbs up for all of us then PM Hmm UI That kind of unfortunately is too quick ME Okay PM Hmm ID Okay ME Well um UI Uh UI I suppose yeah ID Uh so lets talk about our bonuses and the raises were getting for this right UI Um UI Thats it um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you ME Mm ID Right right UI Uh Lets see if I can get this bloody thing to work ID Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay UI Whoops ME Yeah maybe PM So So Uh Brian have you have you finished UI Does it go back in does it UI Reusable ID Something we should get UI I dont know what this is but its really really annoying UI Uhhuh UI Um I have yes PM Uh mine needs also this UI Huh PM At last mine is also the presentation UI Oh right okay youve got more okay ME Oh you got a presentation sorry PM Yeah yeah UI Sorry uh ID Oh ok Uh UI It didnt bother to tell me that on this thing PM S Uh is the project evaluated that is mine UI Is it UI Okay UI Doesnt tell me UI Oh youre doing that PM Yeah UI We evaluated ourselves we thought we were great ME Yeah ME Mm love to eat that now ID Anybody Clay covered banana ME Kind of a green banana now UI Mm ME Its this as well sorry we forgot to mention itll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that weve got UI O okay hold on ME Ive got ID blue UI I wonder w which cell do I want ID Its fun to touch ME Yeah PM So UI Okay I didnt realise you had that bit PM Yeah ME Oh could you pass the tomato please PM So ME Sorry ME Thank you PM So now is the final evaluation final evaluation of the uh uh of our product ME Mmhmm PM How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not PM How mu What rating we will give to these products PM So of course this is will be a team work w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything UI Okay PM So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this PM We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product PM Then trends whether it is as fashion trends or not PM Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays ME Mmhmm PM So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also PM Then marketing strategy of the company PM As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market not only in terms of providing quality products not only in pro providing latest technologies but also in terms of providing environmental s Yeah ME Sorry ME Sorry carry on PM So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues PM So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale UI Okay PM Im having this scale this scale so we have to do it on a board ME Mmhmm ME Okay UI Alright okay UI The board working again is it PM the user requirem I think ID Do we have the uh the marker for the board ME Um UI Uh ID There it is PM Thank you PM So PM So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product ME Mmhmm PM First of all uh comes user requirement PM So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not PM I I will first I would like to have your views what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ME Um I think Yeah it did ME It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted PM S So what do you think you will personally give UI Yeah ME Um so UI When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the TV so yeah of course we havent actually got a working model yet ME Does it work ME Yeah ME So ME I would say seven PM Seven PM Uh ME Seven is good yeah isnt it ME I cant True or false ME No sorry tr one is true UI One yeah PM Uh one is means highest ranking okay ME Yeah PM But I think highest ranking is seven or one UI No its its like true is one end and false is the oth Oh Ill go for a one ID No thats false PM Okay right right ME Okay so one PM So its one for from your point of view ME Yep PM And what do you say our Industrial Expert ID Uh ID Its hard to know ID I I give it a two PM Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design because she was our i Interface Expert ID Okay PM But you can give your views based on technology whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ID Um yeah I think i it might even exceed it um ID But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons ID Um Im gonna give it a two PM Two ID Two PM And what about uh you Brian PM You will go for one UI Basic requirements but of the pro of the project PM Okay PM Uh for me personally it is everything fine it may be having good design it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technologywise pricewise but there is one thing which limits the customers like we are having only two three designs like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange and Uh yeah lower end ME Mm yellow UI Yeah th Come on that was the tha Kay PM And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look ME Uhhuh PM But if a person doesnt like banana or orange you are limiting him ME Uhhuh PM No dont buy our product because we are l we like this only ME Okay PM So we are showing our preference for particular fruits two or three kinds rather and Yeah UI Being fruitist ME Is that no is that not trends PM So PM Uh no uh personally as a Marketing Expert I dont believe that because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits they give a range of products a range of shapes like if we see look at the smallest thing toffee chocolates they give a variety of different things ME Mmhmm PM Some children like to buy banana shape some apple shape some even pineapple shape some orange shape ME Mmhmm PM So you can what shape a person will like PM So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers PM And by limiting them we are limiting our sales limiting our profit also ME Uhhuh ME But in electronics I think its not q always quite so um you dont always have so many choices as with chocolates ME I think you know if youre going to buy a TV maybe a companyll have That youre going to choose from a companyll have two or three choices but theyre different designs ME We were coming up with one product PM Uh maybe PM Okay but I will I will personally wont give it beyond three ME No I mean uh obviously your opinion Im just trying to Okay PM So we can Yeah on an average we can think three four sevenths maybe UI Hes a tough cookie PM Three or four PM Uh no sorry it should be No sorry sorry sorry sorry we are doing a very wrong thing UI Six UI Five or six ME What are we doing ID What are we doing ME Adding them up ID Were gonna average them PM Yeah yeah we are taking everything and thats I have taken it very wrongly ID Okay ME Oh ID So seven fourths PM Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly ID About one point f one point eight PM So we can say one or two ID Okay ME Okay PM because it is one point eight uh two so we will do two UI Oh I see ID Yeah round it up to two PM Yeah ME Okay yeah PM So where were the trends ID So trends ID Can you explain what you want us to write there PM Sorry ID How it how conforms to the current trends PM Yeah again the the fashion trends this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something ME Mmhmm ME Okay PM Uh ME Well um going on uh the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons I would give it um well because its hard to make a fruit good to look at that that looks cool you know so I would actually give it a three ME Tha three or four Im not sure ME Three PM Okay ME Go for three PM Yeah ME Thats fine PM Uh Okay ID Kay ID As far as the uh technology it its got the latest trends in speech technology but its missing the screen as we said um but it does have the pushbuttons or the scrollbuttons um but it doesnt have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism ID So I give it a a four ID Id give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology ME Mm UI Yeah I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some but Im just not swallowing the fruit so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the LCD screen in it ME Yeah UI Um so yeah Id say about four as well PM Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends these products are quite good like these products are in fruit shape because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised like clothes shoes and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables or getting them or showing some association with them ME Mmhmm PM So and in this way our product is good PM And the second thing now people dont want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy ME Mmhmm PM So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market PM And yes PM It is cus spongy also PM So they can play with it its quite good PM So then I think maybe I can give it two PM So four five ten thirteen thirteen PM So we can Is it fine PM So what about company strategy ID Yeah ID Well it was yellow ME Um ME Yeah the company strategy okay ME Um there was lot of discussing that was good ME Um I feel I got my say ME Um so Id give the company strategy a two PM Okay ID Well I think its the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy ME Okay UI Yeah yeah ID Is that the question ME Is it ME Okay ID Um ME Okay so one or two ID Yeah ME One ME Okay just leave it its fine ID Ill go with two PM So what about you Brian UI Um yeah a three UI Pretty much kept to the company strategy so I would go for a a one as we not only kept it but we were limited by Cool groovy ME Mm PM Yeah and me also like this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers requirement as per latest technology and it should be environmental safe PM So since our product meets all these requirements so I would also prefer to give it rank one PM So four six six half ID So one and a half ME Yeah one PM So we can say two or one Okay ID A two PM So th seven seven PM Uh overall we are getting two something but we can round it as two ID Yep ME Okay PM Yeah PM So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good ID S Okay UI Cool PM So we can launch it PM Yeah UI Brilliant ME Woohoo UI In which case we are done UI Cause weve evaluated and we are within budget ME Cool PM So yeah UI Champagne lunch anyone ME Yeah ID Uh PM Great,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product."
ME UI Okay UI So this is uh first meeting of this design project UI Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting I dont know if it was sent round to all of you ME Mm yeah UI Maybe not ME I didnt receive it yet UI Anyway this is the the plan for todays meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly um although Im sure youve actually got some of the information already UI Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more ID Mmhmm UI Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that well be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings um specifically the whiteboard over there UI Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it UI And then thats it UI So weve got twenty five minutes to do that thats until eleven twenty five UI S so any any questions ID so sh UI Is i not at this point ME Not at this point UI So this is our project UI What were aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television UI Um we want it to be something original something trendy and also something user friendly so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product UI The method that were going to use to complete the project that has three components as such UI Theres the functional design of the the remote control UI Were going the way well do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that UI Um similarly with the conceptual design well start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then well bring what weve done together UI Um and then the detailed design will come after that UI Well pull it all together ID Im a bit confused about uh whats the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ID Uh i is it just uh more detail uh as I understand it UI I think it th w were talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where youll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing ID Right ID How how it will be done ID So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ID Uh I think its its in the conceptual design phase that we identify the its in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product UI Um I think well well start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah ID Okay UI Okay so thats just a brief overview of the p the the project itself UI Um what Id like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that were using for for the project specifically the whiteboard ID Hmm UI So each person in turn Id like us to go up to the whiteboard the pens just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while youre doing that tell us your name what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that youre taking in this project PM Why are you looking at me UI Would you like to go first PM Do I have a choice PM Okay PM Ooh ooh things falling everywhere UI Oh yeah p put them in pockets PM Right okay PM Cool UI You dont have to hurry weve got plenty of time PM Okay PM So my names Cat and Im really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um Okay UI Its got no eyes PM Oh good point PM Ah the eyes always ruin it PM Right PM Okay what do its eyes like PM Okay cool PM Um this is a rabbit UI I thought it might be a cat ME Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat PM Yeah I dont think its furry enough so well make it a fluffy rabbit ME Yeah now I now I understand now yeah UI Yeah I can see by the ears ME Yeah PM Okay right its a fluffy rabbit blue PM Rabbits dont come in blue but you know PM Um okay and I like it because its small and its fluffy UI Mm PM And one day youll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink ME Ah PM Okay UI Excellent and whats your whats your role within the team ID Mm PM I am the um I need my notebook mm ooh top banana PM Thank you PM Okay cool I am the Marketing Expert um so like Im gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evadvaluation in the detailed design um so yeah ID Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Okay UI And more about yourself youre from ID Kay PM Um Im from Leicester um second year UI Mmhmm PM Um what else do you want to know PM I like sports um yeah aerobics kickboxing spinning um and uh not with rabbits no no UI But not with rabbits ID Mm PM And vets I like vets as well PM And yeah um and I like cocktails especially pink ones PM Okay ID Cool UI Excellent to match the rabbit PM Cool ME Okay ME Um so my name is Maarika ME Wheres the pen ME Okay UI Theres a an if you have not enough room theres an eraser there and you can rub it off ME Yeah well or I can make it smaller ME Uh so um um Im the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal I m I mean Im not so sure because Im not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals but I do like dogs ME Oh sorry maybe I should have shouldnt have said it beforehand but mm hmm ID Mm ME Um well there are different kinds of dogs but okay um ID Thats not bad at all UI Ah it looks like a dog ID Yep ME Okay PM Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit PM I think it needs four legs if its gonna walk though ME Yeah maybe it has some colourful patches yeah ME Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal UI the other legs are on the other side ME Mm well thats compared to some other animals like cats ME Um theyre really much more fun because they are not so independent ME Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well yeah ME Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say ME Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something yeah UI And where where are you from ME Im from Estonia uh yep UI Estonia ME Um so is there anything else youd like to know ME Oh right my roles um so um in the different um stages of the design so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design ME Okay thats it ID Thank you ID Okay um Ill do some Ill rub the features and let the drawing stay ID Kay um my name is Gaurav ID Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow ID Ive got no idea how to draw a cow UI Good luck ID Uh this is going to be Yeah thatll do PM Theyre not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns ID Okay so let let me draw the body first UI Mm ID Big round body really skinny legs and theyve got a long tail and a long face UI Its eating PM It looks like Eeyore ID And there is some grass there UI Yeah ID So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass they do not disturb anybody um theyre kind of Buddhist in a way PM Horns draw some horns ID So yeah I like cows ID Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer so Im supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever itll mm take during the functional role what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design what are the various components of it and um finally Im not too sure what was the last part ID Um the detailed design I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other ID Um Im from India ID Uh Im doing my PHD in Psycholinguistics I sit at the Department of Psychology ID Yeah UI Excellent ID Thank you ME Thanks UI Right now now its my turn obviously UI Okay heres a space ID That doesnt look like a cow does it ME It looks very very cute UI Yeah I like the cow UI Im Jen ME Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Um I like dogs too but I cant do that already because I cant draw a dog as well as you can UI I like Mm PM Is that a lizard ID No way UI Hmm ME Wow UI Its a gecko ME Ah a gecko okay ID Ah okay UI Yeah PM Is there a difference ME Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah they are mmhmm UI Theyre Yeah theyre l its a kind of lizard UI And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening ME Ah ID Uhhuh ME Mmhmm ME I hope you dont like snakes do you UI I dont like snakes UI I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes ME Okay ME Mmhmm UI Thats where Im from Australia UI Im from Melbourne and Im your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product ID Mm ME Wonderful UI Okay ID Thank you UI So lets see whats next in the PowerPoint presentation UI So Ive just thought yeah Ive just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go PM If you right click on it you can Yeah I was looking at the website and the other things that theyve made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures ID Mmhmm UI Okay so this is the um overall budget for our project UI Weve got um were planning to sell these remote controls for lets make that go away that means weve got five minutes UI Um were planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each UI Um and with that were aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros UI And thats selling them on the international market not just in the UK UI Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target UI So thats something to keep in mind while youre designing UI Okay UI Hmm UI This is let me just skip ahead to see thats the last thing okay UI Weve only got a couple of minutes UI Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what were thinking of this remote control ME Yep ME Im just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones UI Mmhmm UI I think thats probably something that w its best if we take away with us but if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary ID Mmhmm ID I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this UI Something something new ID Mm UI Mmhmm PM So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so its something that is sleek and stylish but its still functional you know UI Mmhmm PM So Im kind of thinking you know like those phones that they have the new generation ones where they dont actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that UI Uhhuh ID Alright PM You know so something heading towards that so its not overly I mean I dont know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls so I figure how many do you need you know UI Mmhmm ID Mm PM Okay UI So perhaps some sort of menubased thing or Mmhmm PM Something thats a little less crowded than this like I mean you know theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV right UI Yeah PM But what do most people do PM They turn it on they watch certain specified channels you know and then they turn it off again ID Yeah UI Yeah ID There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time yeah PM Sometimes they play a movie PM Yeah so theres no need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do Yeah UI Yeah UI So no ID Yep UI It could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that ME Mmhmm ID And then use the Mm PM So if youre the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works then you know thats fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons which just confuse them UI Mmhmm PM Hmm UI Excellent PM Cause like if you look at the train its just very like theres no extra bits on it the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people but it looks really pretty too UI Oh I havent had a look yet yep UI Mmhmm UI Great UI Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ID Mm ID Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life although I dont think that um its a huge problem for remote controls anyway battery life uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries UI Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Um Hmm ME Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldnt uh go like too far away from from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning yeah yeah ID Yeah ID A big learning curve yeah UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID So i it should kind of fit in as well and the stereotype of a yeah UI Its like those fancy websites that you cant access because you have no idea how to get in but the designers thought they were great ME Hmhmm UI Okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this UI Um weve got another meeting in thirty minutes so youre youll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace but im basically youre looking at the working design youre looking at the technical functions design and for you its the user requirements specification like you said at the start ID Alright PM Mmhmm UI Okay ME Okay UI Thanks for that ME Thank you UI Uh Ill see you in half an hour ME See you UI Carry the laptops back again ID Hmm UI Do we need to unplug things UI Probably,"The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda. She explains the project, which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The three components of completing the project will be functional, conceptual, and detailed design. They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name, role, drawing their favorite animal, and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal. After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have. They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional. They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting."
UI All hooked up UI Okay so now we are here at the functional design meeting UI Um hopefully this meeting Ill be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time cause this is when you get to show us what youve been doing individually UI The agenda for the meeting I put it in the sh shared documents folder UI I dont know if that meant that you could see it or not UI Did anyone ME No ID Mm UI No UI Oh well UI Um Ill try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there theres a shared project documents folder UI Um and it should be in there ME Mm ME Um um wi on on a what ME Oh project project documents yeah yeah yeah okay UI Project documents yeah UI So Ill put it in there ME Oh okay yeah UI Is it best if I send you an email maybe to let you know its there ME Yes I think so UI Yep UI Ill do that next time UI Um Ill act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through and then Ill send them to you after the meeting UI The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that youve been preparing during the time so well go through each of you one by one UI Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us UI I just sent at the last minute Im sorry about that but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing ME Yeah the last minute yeah yeah ME Yeah UI Um and then we need to by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target groups going to be and what the functions of the remote control thats the the main goal is to come up with those two things target group and functions of the remote control UI And weve got forty minutes to do that in UI So I would say yeah ID You said uh targ target groups what does that mean UI As uh who it is that were going to be trying to sell this thing to yeah ME Um Okay ID Uh okay kay ID So are Okay UI So we need to yeah we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself UI So with that I think its best if I hand over to you UI Does anyone have a preference for going first ID Alright ID I can go first yeah UI You wanna go first UI Okay so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours ME Hmm UI I assume we just pull it out ME Mm ID Right ID Um so f from the Right sure UI Just before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations UI Once we you dont have to do it now but when once you go back just so that I dont have to scribble everything down ME Okay yeah afterwards yeah okay ID Uh okay ID So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh Ive identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other ID So this is the method that uh Ill mostly be following in my um in my uh role ID Um the identification of the components uh and uh since since Im dealing only with the technical aspects I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person UI Hmm ID Uh well then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design so its a cyclical process ID Okay so these were the basic findings from today ID The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email ID Uh I just quickly jotted them down ID Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other ID Um okay so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control ID Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex ID And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television ID How however our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television in order to keep things simple ID Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard ID Okay so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control ID Um theres basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface ID The user interf interface communicates with the chip so Ill basic go over to the Okay ID So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything ID There is a user interface here ID So whe when the user presses a button it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code which is then communicated to the remote site which h has an infrared receiver ID Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating ID Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control whatever new functions that we need to do um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger basically UI Mmhmm ID Okay ID Um so i in my personal preferences um Im hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible ID This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time ID And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and its compatible with mot most uh televisions ID Thats about it ID So anything that you would like to know or No I dont have any idea about what each component costs UI Okay ME Thanks UI Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point UI Br Okay ID Um yeah UI Cause thats something to consider I guess if were if were using more advanced technology it might increase the price ID Anything else ID Yeah ID Certainly yeah ID So so tha yeah we definitely need to operate within our constraints but um unfortunately I I do not have any data so uh I just identified the functional components for that UI Yeah UI Thats fine UI Are there any more questions or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ME I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably UI Yeah I think that will do ID Yeah okay ME Yeah UI Okay so do you want to Yes shall shall we pull this up ME Yeah I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay yeah UI I think that has to come out of there ID Yeah ID Mm kay UI Yeah ME Thanks UI Yeah I thought those last minute things theyre gonna hit you the worst ME Oh i Okay I hope wait ME Should it just Theres just nothing ID I itll take some time UI It ta takes a little Oh and have you you need to then also press on yours function F eight so the blue function key at the bottom and F eight ME Oh right right right um Okay ME Nothin okay something is coming up ID Oh there it is yeah UI Now its coming computer no signal ID Itll come up it um uh no signal ME No signal ME Why UI Maybe again ID Yeah yeah it says something now adjusting Okay ME Oh ME My my computer went blank now UI Okay adjusting ME Adjusting ME But I dont see anything I dont see anything on my computer now UI There we go there we go ME This is the problem but Um ID Oh thats strange UI Oh if you press if you press function and that again theres theres usually three modes one where its only here one where its only there and one where its both ID Okay ID And one more time UI Okay so one more time ME Uh now its okay ME No ME No UI Should yeah just wait for a moment adjusting ID Mm ME Oh okay ME Okay thats fine thats good UI Okay ME Okay lets start from the beginning ME So Im going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up ME Um kay so the method I was um adopting at this point its not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but its just at th at this very moment UI Mmhmm ME Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used ME And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities ME And yeah and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words UI Mmhmm ME Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set so this quite straightforward ME And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on switching off uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel so we would need the numbers ME And and also the volume is very important ME Um um I als okay ID Sorry cou could you go back for a second ID Uh switching on off channel uh volume okay thats great ME Kay ME Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design like operating a VCR but they dont seem to be able to deal with DVD players but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design UI Mmhmm ME So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size ME And then it must be easy to use so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something ME Um then yeah the musthave buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel and then volume has to be there ME But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu ME And yeah the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities the answer was already no because of the last minute update UI Mmhmm ME So at the for the time being thats uh thats all ME If you have questions Yeah and also its its um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and DVD there are the mm um video CDs and whatever so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things UI Yeah UI If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management but if we had a a decent case for that we really think its important to include video and DVD I could get back to them and see UI Its w its just whether its worth arguing about UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ID So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want ID Um but um so so at this stage uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that ID But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ME Um well I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use I mean um what other options would you have ID Right ME A little screen or something but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno ID Yeah and itll make the costs yeah ID Right UI Mmhmm ME I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons but if if you have other mm proposals um ID Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them UI Mm ID So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that ME Yeah UI Mm ME Yeah ID Uh i if the if the costs allow we can have like an LCD display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well ME Mmhmm ID So yeah UI Mmhmm ME Yep ID Cool UI Sure we can discuss that maybe after the next one PM Cool UI Do you want to yeah PM Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ME Uh am I going in the right direction ME No ME Wait PM Yeah ME Okay here it comes UI Oh Im getting hungry ME Okay here you are PM Cool PM Ah thats why it wont meet PM Okay cool UI You set PM Yep cool PM Okay functional requirements UI Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here PM Alright yeah UI Hello ID try to press oh okay yep UI Is it plugged in prop its working PM Its working UI Okay UI Excellent PM Cool okay PM So what I have wh where Ive got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire PM Um so it was all about you know how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control you know PM Whats the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and LCD screens in remote control PM Not that they actually gave me any answers on the LCD screens so I should have taken that bit out but anyway PM Um okay so PM What they found is that people dont like how current remote controls are so you know definitely you should be looking at something quite different PM Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly PM Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense PM Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know a nice looking remote control PM Um current remote controls they dont match the user behaviour well as youll see on the next slide PM Um I dunno what zapping is but Oh right UI Its um switching between channels sort of randomly going through PM But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you whats on PM Um okay fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons so thats going back to what you know we were saying earlier about you know do you need all the buttons on the remote control they just make it look ugly ID Mm ID Right UI Mm PM Okay PM Cool PM Um so this is my little graph thing UI Ooh thats a bit difficult to see PM Mm k Okay well I can send it to all of you UI If you explain it to us itll be fine UI Yeah PM What it is is um its cones cause I thought theyd be more exciting PM Um but ooh wheres it go UI I liked the I liked the litt ooh come back PM Back PM Oh UI No PM Oh yes cool PM Okay Im gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing ID Mmhmm PM Um okay so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing thats used most is the channel selection UI Okay PM What you cant see is volume selection its a little bit higher than all the others UI Mmhmm thats the next one along yeah PM Yeah so what the graph shows is that you know power channel selection and volume selection are important and the rest of them you know nobody really uses and so thats the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance you know so on a scale of one to ten how important is that and you know channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential and the power well its not quite so essential apparently although I dont understand how it couldnt be um and everything else I think you know you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control cause theyre just not needed and theyre not used UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Okay PM This is the bit that the email messed up for me and thats what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing PM Okay cool PM So um okay so this is what people find annoying about remote controls PM Uh that they get lost that the uh you know theyre not intuitive and that theyre bad for repetitive strain injury UI Mmhmm PM I think if youre watching enough TV to get repetitive strain injury from um you know watching TV then thats the least of your problems but you know its up there UI The remote control ID Mm PM Um that yeah PM Okay so um I mean the the RSI thing would be that like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know not straining your wrists watching TV ID Right UI Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Hmm PM Yes PM Okay cool PM Right um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table and I didnt have time to white it out again UI Thats alright PM Um okay but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software PM So you can see from that that you know younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software whereas as people get older theyre a bit more sceptical about it and theyre less willing to to try it PM Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV you know tends to be people talking and um you know how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching TV UI Mm ID Right PM Um okay PM Cool PM Um okay so these are my personal preferences PM So you have sleek stylish sophisticated you know so something thats you know a bit cool PM Um you know functional so its useful but minimalist PM Um theres a theres an important thing that you know people use when you know when youre filling up your home you know a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap basically you know and youve got all this stuff and youre just like what the hell is that who is ever gonna use it PM You know so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both so I think we need to aim for both ID Mm ID Mm PM Um okay then a long battery life like you were talking about earlier and um you know I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because you know your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit PM Um and then like a locator so you know kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah thats it you know ID Mm ID Some kind of a ring some Right UI Keys and things like that yeah UI Whistle and it screams at you yeah PM I know its weird PM My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything PM So yeah so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps something a kind of sound that you dont often hear on the TV you know cause you dont want your remote control beeping every five minutes cause you youd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something UI Mmhmm PM So okay ID Hmm PM Cool PM Thats me UI Thats you excellent ID Okay thats great thanks ME Um thats very good very interesting UI Um UI Im just gonna tick yes UI So weve got about ten fifteen minutes to discuss Mmhmm ID Mm ID I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cats uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people PM Cats PM Ca ID So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned if we want to have something sleek and uh you know good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know people who are comparatively elderly ID Um PM Yeah I mean thats the thing is that it didnt say in the survey you know whether you know these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control but Im assuming you know yes ID Right ID Right ID Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish then uh th itll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people yeah UI Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I dont know how often theyre buying televisions ID Right and Right PM Well thats when you go to uni isnt it ID Mm PM So you know Yeah UI Yeah but you dont have much money generally ME Yeah ME Yeah you share a television or something that yeah UI I wouldve thought its its more that twenty five to thirty five when people are really moving out and theyve got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh its on sorry we unplugged it ID Right ID But uh still if if you can go back to that slide and uh how popular was it PM Oh Ive unplugged it PM Do you want me to Yeah ID Oh oh okay UI Here let me Yeah ID Thats alright if you can just look it up on your computer wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them PM Seventy six point three percent ME It was seventy something yeah yeah PM Yeah UI Mmhmm ID So even they are seventy six percent is that high amount PM Yeah I kn I mean I know what youre saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they dont have like I mean you know if youre at university youre paying your rent but you dont have a mortgage you dont have a life insurance policy you dont normally have a car yeah so UI Yeah UI Yeah theyve got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things ID Alright UI Kids ID Yeah PM Youre still learning to drive actually so that just costs more than a car but yeah UI Yeah ID So youre more likely to b Yeah PM Um so I mean like it is an age group to target really I think UI Yeah and if were if were talking twenty five Euros as a price thats not unaffordable even for young people PM No I mean thats what thats like fifteen Pounds UI Yeah PM You know I think Yeah I d I dont know many people without a TV ME Yeah this this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it whether they do have a TV to use its full Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah UI But do they But the TVs are often kind of someones old TV thats blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote PM We didnt have a TV last year and everyone thought we were off our heads you know ME Common the students yeah yeah ME The s the stu yeah and the remote control might not yeah it might not even function with the old TV ID Mm PM Yeah I d well weve weve got quite a d decent TV UI Mm ID Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five its quite popular right ME Yeah were still yeah UI Yeah ID So mm uh are are are Mm ME Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target because actually I mean theyre all still re young people PM Yeah PM I think I think the fact that you know ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control does say quite a lot really UI Yeah PM You know so I mean that and the disposable income and I dont think its something to ignore you know UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Is not a massive difference you know ME Yeah UI Yeah if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition PM No do totally ID Mm ME Yeah UI Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ID Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features but voice recognition itself Im not very sure about because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it UI Mmhmm ID Uh and uh Yeah PM You do have it in your mobile phone though dont you PM Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them UI Yeah ID But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah PM I dont know UI Yeah UI With um but with a TV remote its gonna be quite limited if were t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five louder tha that should be relatively simple ME An Yeah PM Yeah ID Right PM S so y youd maybe need a code word ID Right ID Okay ID O Right PM Do you know what I mean UI Mm PM So like when you say change except thats being said quite a lot on TV so maybe like you know remote PM I mean how often do people say remote on TV UI Yeah ID Mm PM Although I only watch Charmed so really I wouldnt know but like so youd just say remote five you know remote ten remote one two nine ID Right ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Okay so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check UI Um so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course were going to get th anyone whos older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money then theyll theyll still go for the same advertising ME Yeah but uh um Yeah yeah sure yeah yeah ME Yeah PM I dont think theres a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls ME Yeah w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons but I think this is not really the right moment yet because people are just so used to buttons and um yeah its its kind of safer so we we need both so the voice recognition would be just an extra it wouldnt really reduce the size of the remote UI Yeah I think we need both ID Mm ID W What uh Mm UI Yeah UI Mm ID What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control ID If we can do with away with that our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say I want to watch uh ITV one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five UI Uhhuh PM Yeah that would be another way to do it UI Uhhuh ID Yeah so if uh if something like that can be incorporated some kind of Mmhmm UI So that if that was in the the voice recognition that would be great PM Yeah but then the code word would be even more important because I mean Sky advertise on every channel dont they you know so then it would be youd be watching Charmed and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Watch Sky and yeah PM Yeah yeah and that would be really annoying ID Alright ID Yeah thats Right UI Mmhmm UI But thats definitely a possibility ME Yeah but m but on the other hand remote control isnt as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the TV would be already further away so it might not pick up the other things coming from there ID Mm UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though UI So that you can yell at it yeah PM Yeah you know so you have to have the remote control PM Its more like if you lost it and its down the sofa sometime you can yell at it and itll just change it you can look for it later yeah UI Yeah UI Alright ME Yeah but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of its its not that its sitting there on on top of the television because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldnt you you wouldnt need the remote control so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself PM Yeah yeah I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah ID Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what youre saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean itll itll mm UI Mm ME Yeah yeah yeah UI Yeah ME No but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us a and uh not to yell at it from the distance UI Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Mm UI Yeah ID So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the TV so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control wherever it is itll beep so we we can probably come to know where it is UI Mmhmm UI Thats but then if youre buying the remote separately but y you could have something but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the TV or something some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack so one part attaches to the TV ME Okay ME Oh yeah yeah ID Right yeah yeah yeah ME Okay yeah mmhmm PM Yeah cause its its quite important that you dont lose the the bit to locate the remote control UI The l Well thats right but it solves the problem of having different noises ID Alright yeah PM Yeah definitely yeah UI Yeah UI Okay I think were gonna have to wrap this up um UI But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that were looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds we want it to look simple but still have the buttons so its easy to use but only those key buttons the major buttons and then one sort of menu one and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether its really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um ME The major ones yeah ME Mmhmm ID Right ID Okay UI What we have to do now is to go back to our little places complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation which y youll get immediately by email UI Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes and then weve got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work ME Mmhmm UI Um Ill put the minutes in that project documents folder but Ill send you an email when I do it so that you know ID So where exactly is this i Ah okay UI It should be on your desktop so on the yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah UI So Ill put it Ill put them there as soon as Ive written them ME Did you find it ME Its just yeah yeah ID Yeah yeah in that one right yeah UI Yeah and email them round PM Oh so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there hey UI Yeah that would be great PM Okay ME Oh so so well just put them i there we we yeah w we wont even okay UI Oh yeah put them in there UI Yeah then you dont have to email them PM There you go PM But is everyones called functional requirements UI No theyre all called something slightly different ID No UI Technical requirements and something something yeah PM Okay so thats good ME Yeah PM Thats me done UI So if you put them in there well all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to PM Okay cool UI Um as to where were going from here youre going to look at the components concept ID Right UI Yeah UI Whatever that means ME Yeah UI Yeah ID I guess Ill find out UI Youll be looking youll be looking at the user interface concept on something conceptual and youre watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognitionll fall off the map or something that um well keep keep our options op hmm ME Uh something conceptual yeah ID Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ID Con components oh UI Components yeah ME Hmm ME Sorry but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare okay yeah thats good UI No we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare so thats fine w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary ME Okay UI Okay UI Right on time ME Cool UI Okay so you can I guess well see you for lunch in a sec ME Okay see you,"The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control. She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions. The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable. The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator. They discuss the target group, deciding it should be 15-35 year olds. After they talk about features they might include, the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks."
UI Excellent UI So um I sent you the agenda it was on the in the project documents UI I dont know if you got a chance to just have a look at it UI Anyway its the meetings gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time so well go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what youve been up to UI Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what youve come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts so thats we need to know about the components properties materials the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching ID Right UI Okay UI Um do you wanna start again ID Okay UI Let me weve got forty minutes ID Right s so I havent made a PowerPoint presentation yeah I I thought Ill use the whiteboard instead UI You havent made a PowerPoint okay UI Mmhmm ID Um mm okay so basically Ill start off by uh I thought Ill use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that UI Lets hope the pen holds out UI Mmhmm ID Okay so uh Ill start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Okay so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote right UI Mmhmm ID If you open it you have a circuit board here right and this is the chip that I was talking about last time ID This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here which then uh sends the information to an LED device here UI Mmhmm ID If you flip the printed circuit board and this is th the most important point here uh everything else is kind of Okay so if you flip the circuit board this is what it looks like ID So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes the information goes to the chip which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation which goes goes out through there UI Yeah ID So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make you can ge get them printed as you want to so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost the way we want to have UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Right ID So thats the important point here so these are the different options that we have ID Okay ID So the batteries Ill start with the battery right UI Mmhmm ID So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells yeah UI Yeah ID Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes right ID So ID And dynamos ID Um yeah yeah PM Does that mean like a windup one ID So uh I dont know if even if you want to consider this but these are the different things that the company makes so th theyll theyll since uh theyll come internally from the company theyll be eas uh cheaper uh all these options PM A windup remote UI Okay UI Mmhmm ID So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones PM You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then people could exercise whilst watching TV ID Yeah UI And charging their remote yeah PM Yeah and stop worrying about the whole RSI from the remote thing cause thats just Yay ID Yeah its a good option ME So what was what was this k ka Okay ID The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches since our hand keeps moving it keeps the watch ticking UI Uh yeah ID But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control because itll just lie there for a long while sometimes UI Mmhmm UI For a remote cause you Yeah ID But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID And the fourth option is the solar cells which are also made by the company ID Environment friendly ID Okay um so Ill list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybodys perspective UI Yeah ID There are different cases that can be provided ID They can be basically the shape of the cases they can be flat they can be curved with uh onesided curved and one side flat and they can be curved with on both the sides UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID These are the three options right ID Um Yeah would it be flat on both the sides would be curved from one side or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available um like it can be in plastic rubber wood or titanium right ME Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control yeah mmhmm ME Yeah mmhmm mmhmm ME Mmhmm mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Okay PM Did you say wool ID Wo wo wood UI Wood wood PM Wood ID Yeah PM Oh right UI A fluffy remote ID Not wool PM Yeah youll understand why when we get to my presenta ID Oh really ID Okay UI Huh ID Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment so its kind of um uh itll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface ID If we choose this we cannot use titanium UI Mm ID For for these two we can use titanium wood rubber or plastic UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Uh okay the interface options now ID So we can have pushbuttons like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making pushbuttons ID Ooh ID Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah yeah something like that PM Sony UI Mmhmm PM Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it PM Mm ID So and they have they can even have an an integrated uh pushbutton inside the scrolling thing UI Okay ID The scroll plus push ID So this is something that has been recently developed by the company um in the last decade so not too recent ID And LCDs we can have LCDs ID So these two are recent and and this is q quite old UI Mmhmm ID The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so theres theres a chip behind this one right ID The PCB is uh inexpensive so we can put put in uh whatever we want but the various integrated circuit options are we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced UI Mmhmm ID And uh the price goes up as we go down obviously UI Mmhmm ID Um okay so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip UI Mmhmm ID Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels ID Right ID Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender which is did not explained what i what it was but Im guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker ID So Im guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know as soon as you press a button it it mm uh give gives you feedback one five or whatever ID Yeah on UI Mmhmm ID Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not but anyway UI Mmhmm ID So these are the different options that we have ID Okay so th thats thats basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important yeah UI Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Excellent UI Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to you can sit down but just we might need you to leap up ME Okay ID Yeah yeah sure ID Sure ID Yeah UI What are you PowerPoint or Okay ME Okay ME Um I have some PowerPoint yeah ID Right ME Oh UI Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ME Kay UI Some sort of radiation PM No its got its little camera in there plug it in UI Yeah ME Okay PM S a Ugly ID Yeah it should should do it ID Yeah UI Right interface concept ME Okay ME Um to be honest actually I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk UI Thats fine ME So um yeah this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again UI Mmhmm ME Okay ME So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so its the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data ME So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well and colour and so on UI Mmhmm ME Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant ME Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product UI Mmhmm ME So some findings um um ME So in in the case of many user interfaces theyre just so full of buttons that its actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and its just confusing it takes y know time to learn ME Um okay and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found ME Okay some of them are here ME Um well the picture is not very clear but as you can see there are actu oi oh oh oh sorry for that ME S go back ID Thats nice one ME Ah no please ME Okay so yeah theyre quite big and have many many buttons ME Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one because its its the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well ME And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice UI Mm ME Um okay ME So lets carry on with this ME Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh ME Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait no this is not the one ME Okay there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i its possible to record eighty different voice samples on it UI Mmhmm ID Mm ME Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the LC display UI Its yeah ME Um s another new development is a scroll button which was also th also already mentioned ME And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess its it should be UI Yeah ME Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition but its once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker there can be a um preprogrammed answer for example you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever UI Uhhuh hi yeah ME So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include ID Mm ID Uh sorry uh can you go back for a second ID Um uh are you sure wha what this means a spinning wheel with the LC display ID Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay the iPod thing yeah UI Its like the like you said no UI The scroll scroll wheel PM Yeah you cant Oh its like the iPod ME No no the scroll button is a different thing ME I I have a picture if you just a moment Ill Ill show you ME I wasnt completely sure myself but I think its just like um its its a wheel its like not separate buttons ME Look this one here ME But Im Im not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round its like you press this or this or Uhhuh PM G yeah no you can ID Uh its the iPod uh kind of uh Alright right PM Its like its like where you you know how you have your your mouse and y you go round and i its kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah UI Uhhuh ID Okay okay ID So instead of going down you just spin yeah yeah PM It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first but its actually very like fast UI Mmhmm ID Uhhuh UI Mmhmm PM I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get em much slower so its quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff UI Mmhmm ID Right PM Do you know if youre lookin if youre th scrolling through the A to Z of your music and youre looking for something at T then its a lot faster than the wheel but youve got a lot less control over it ID Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Right ID So maybe I should include that here as well LCDs um plus spinning ME Mm UI Yeah ME Uh Okay and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time UI Yeah UI Mmhmm ME It it has to be small simple ME Okay we decided to include voice recognition so to have the standard uh major buttons like on off um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen ME Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button I thought it could be for for voice like I dunno it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something ME There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldnt use something like this for for the remote control ID Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME So yeah thats uh thats it UI Excellent UI Okay straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once ID Right PM Okay Ive put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah UI The project documents UI Excellent UI If you two could both do that as well in case we need to refer to it ID Mmhmm PM Cool UI Here it comes UI Okay PM Fabulous PM Okay cool PM Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future UI Mmhmm PM Okay PM Right PM Now the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect which is twice as important as the third a aspect UI Okay PM So I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect really ID Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Um you know people want something new something technologically innovative and different so the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like quite the thing to go for UI Mmhmm ID Okay PM And um yeah it wants to look fancy fancy look and feel ID So um uh maybe uh as youre discussing things is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here PM So Yeah yeah UI Yeah yeah sure UI Yeah ID Right ID So mm uh so it yeah so probably voice recognition is is kind of important right UI Thats over on the interface if if you could put Yeah ID Um and an yeah UI And maybe the LCD and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing ID Okay I I have a point about LCD I dunno if it is the right point to take it up ID W uh LCDs are basically for feedback right to the user whos pressing buttons and the feedback can come through television itself so do we need an LCD on the remote UI Mmhmm PM Mm PM Depends how fast your television runs really dont dont you think PM I mean weve got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the TV and then you wait and then it comes so i it actually takes quite a long time ID Mm UI Mm PM And if you get the number in wrong then its a bit of a pain so I think you know a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that ID Right PM But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit ID Right UI It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you dont interrupt the picture on the screen so if youre watching something Yeah PM You know PM Yeah ID Thats true yeah thats also Right PM And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with new information about whats on and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah UI Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure PM But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone you know like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screens protected so it doesnt actually get scratched UI Mm ID Mmhmm PM So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control you know or like a minimalist remote control UI Yeah PM So you got your buttons one to nine your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it you flip it open and yeah ID Mm right UI And then you can flip it open ID Okay ID So now we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style and Right UI Yeah I think so PM Yeah so that kind of decides your whole chip thing UI Yeah ID You you agree ID Maarika yeah ME Yep yeah ID Yeah UI Right ID So LCDs yeah definitely PM Okay ID Go on PM Cool PM Okay apparently fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration PM Sorry I discovered clip art PM Um so these will be an important feature for clothes shoes and furniture PM So I mean Im taking this to mean you know curviness PM Do you know PM Cause you dont tend to get flat vegetables UI Yeah and possibly even uneven like not not symmet yeah ID Mmhmm PM You know PM Yeah bit of asymmetry and stuff PM But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um RSI issue in there because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that its suitable for use with the right hand UI Mmhmm ID Right ME Mmhmm ID Mm UI Mmhmm PM Um yeah Im not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy PM Um Yeah but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldnt get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber UI Something a bit squishy and Yeah and itd help if you drop it it protects it as well ID Yeah we we have we have rubber but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases they wont allow us to use solar cells as an energy source that is the constraint so um we could use titanium wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah w energy source ME So it could be like a rubbery yeah uhhuh PM Yeah yeah UI To some degree UI Uhhuh UI Or if we want to use the the latex then we have to go with one of the other um power things PM If its made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there you could just bounce it up and down UI From from bouncing it ID Yeah tap it on the desk yeah UI You can have it as like a little ball to bounce that flips open PM Yeah PM Um so yeah um okay ID Mm ID So probably double curved surface is the way to go yeah PM Yeah yeah UI Mm yeah ID Or or curved at one end and flat on the top because I Im not sure if it is flat on both both the sides then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etcetera ID Um Yeah PM You have to have a certain element of flatness I think PM It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it you know its like how you put your hands so y its the least movement basically ID Yeah ID Yeah singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much does it UI Uhhuh ID It uh Mm PM No I d I dont think it makes a lot of difference PM I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight but its curvy so UI Mm PM Besides you have four sides to a thing so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing UI Yeah cause the Yeah ID Uh I think uh Right ID Right UI Dunno ID Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three PM Yeah ID Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case ID It does not say anything about uh whether technically you know this this stuff is available at all UI Nothing to open them PM Yeah PM Uh its its more about the protecting the LCD which I think is where it came from ID Right yeah yeah PM But no my research didnt tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures cause I had nothing better to do with my time ID Right ID Okay PM Okay cool UI Anything else UI Whatve we got PM Uh combine style with a level of functionality um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function UI Okay so ID Cool thanks PM Okay ME Thanks Yeah uhhum yeah UI Looking at what weve got we we want an LCD display with a spinning wheel ID Yeah ID Lets lets try to r rub off things and yeah so um hand dynamos are definitely out right UI Yeah rub off some of those ID You you got a wind dynamo yeah UI Yeah its not thats not streamlined and sexy having a having a wind up ID Okay ID Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal but uh its Yeah UI I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs PM Its about the practicality of it really isnt it PM You know ID As against a watch which constantly keeps moving this this thing will have to be tapped every time which which might be very frustrating for the user PM I mean if I cant imagine a m wooden remote control ID Kinetic energy it needs I dont have too much technical information on that yeah right UI Pr presumably if theyre suggesting it then we could use it ID Okay lets keep it option uh keep an option yeah UI Id Id keep it on ID Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out right UI We dont want that its no its not not vegetable ID It has to be at least curved from one side yeah ME Yeah its yeah ID Um okay we still have all all the options ID Wood do you think wood will be a good idea ME N wood is I cant n how do you uh I mean you cant keep it really small uh you cant make it like thin and The wood thing ID Mm ID Right UI Mm ME Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mmmm yeah ID Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it its likely to break its its much more uh Right UI Mm ME Yeah yeah UI Yeah and given that were were looking at more spongy material preferences I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah ME Yeah ME U yeah wood is not really yeah PM Well its not very cleanable either do you know ID Thats true ME Yeah PM Its its not a practical I mean its its alright for a table but for a remote control you know ID Yeah PM And splinters and stuff and It just m doesnt make any sense I think is the thing with wood ID Yeah okay wood is out UI Yeah ID Right ME Yeah yeah in the case of remote control not really UI Yeah ID Okay now for the really interesting stuff the interface UI Yeah ID Right so uh the the pushbuttons is is our expertise uh in the industry but uh it seems to be out of trend you know nobody seems to be Mm right PM You have to have some pushbuttons dont you ME Yeah but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them wouldnt you UI Mmhmm PM G yeah yeah ME Yeah so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the LCD display is kind of yeah its faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control but if you do want to use LCD then you flip it open but its it its more timeconsuming ID Oh if if we have LCD displays that opens up a whole world you know if you have an LCD display then mm you can select almost everything on the LCD display UI Just for fast Yeah ID Right ID Okay UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah PM I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made where you know the buttons that people use all the time you want buttons for them and everything else menudriven ID Mm right ME Yeah UI And it yeah L LCD ID So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options ID Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ID Or do we have just uh channel plus channel minus just to just to scroll ME No no I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers because its uh otherwise people dont want to flip through all the channels ID The numbers PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as LCD ID Right ME Um Yeah I would say buttons because its yeah ID Or on the LCD we can you know Okay PM G yeah I would think buttons yeah UI Buttons PM Its its the I think the thing is so if someone just wants to turn on their TV and put on a channel then it should be easier to use than any other remote and then if someone wants to you know change the contrast on their TV and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible but you know I mean most of the time I mean theres a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the TV I think is the the the issue there ME I Yeah ID So mm Alright UI Mm UI Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Right ID Okay so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um Uh okay UI I think thats what you guys are gonna do next so if we put down the key um things that we want ID Okay okay so the components ME Yeah ID Right so uh what about the the scrolling uh ME Yeah but n I Im not completely um completely clear uh I yeah about the spinning wheel ME So I think it it doesnt make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing its uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah yeah in that case PM E either or G yeah UI Just spinning and not scrolling I would say PM I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel so you have to decide whether you you know you want to be going so fast or not UI Yeah PM But I mean the the thing with this whole if y youre planning on making it out of rubber on the basis that its spongy then Im not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work UI Hmm ID Mm um Im not sure itll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber UI But if youve got a if if youve got a flipped thing effectively its something thats curved on one side and flat on the other side but you folded it in half ME Ah but I mean you can Yeah I um I think so too I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons rubber buttons but then Yeah PM Yeah but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side UI Th that would be on one side uhhuh ID Uh i it Or or at the corners edges just the edges covered by rubber or something like that UI No I think its just the casing rubber on the outside PM You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it ID Mmhmm PM Cause I know like were going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel but I have like a you know obviously my iPods not made of rubber but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour theoretically to match my outfit ID Right right UI Mm ID Right okay so so that gives us a more trendy look as well ID Um Right PM Yeah I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now UI Mmhmm ID Yeah and uh were going more for the trends than for the usability anyway right ME Mmhmm UI Thats right thats what theyre after PM Yeah ID So Ill rub that out ID And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such you know just keep it black or Mm UI Mmhmm ME Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company so would it be like yellow grey and black or something or Yeah does Yeah UI I guess PM That doesnt fit in with the whole vegetable theme though UI Bananas ME Bananas yellow yeah definitely PM Yeah but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours do you know PM So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then youd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it UI Mmhmm UI Green UI Yeah ID Okay ID Um okay if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits ID Uh since were having LCDs there theres no way that were will be able to um what we do need to consider however is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering but since LCDs seems to be uh a definite yes so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend UI We need the advanced yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah ID So Ill rub off the other two UI Mmhmm PM So are we discounting solar energy because rubbers gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber UI That was the We cant have solar panels with rubber so ID Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah ID Yeah ID So I think uh well have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one I mean a although it does seem uh interesting PM Yeah okay so we lose that I think UI Shall we go for if were going for rubber we think uh on as our case and then Yeah ME Mmhmm ME And the buttons as well I think ME Yeah UI Weve got five more minutes UI Mmhmm PM Yeah UI Yeah ID But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah UI Yeah mmhmm PM Its just a gimmick ID Okay ID Uh okay so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback right UI Mmhmm ID It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that so Ye yeah we we dont have too much information about it um Yeah okay so so th this is in as well then the sample speaker UI Yeah UI I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost then Id put them in but if its Yeah ME Yeah but it it I think it should be quite cheap because its from our own company yeah UI Its from the company so Yeah UI Okay ID Right UI And the case is curved on one side but then flat flat so its flipped into each other ID Flat on the top ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Okay UI Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer PM Yeah sure j Sorry do you want me to What does um ICS mean UI Just so we can Nothing its right Im just There we go ID ICs ID Uh integrated circuits PM Okay cool PM So its advanced integrated circuits ID Yeah UI Uh oh now Ive gone too far ID Uh um we were definitely going in for voice recognition as well as LCDs mm ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Were on our way UI Okay UI So weve basically worked out that were going with a simple battery the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber ID Right ID Yep UI Were having pushbuttons on the outside and then on the inside an LCD with spinning wheel and were incorporating voice recognition UI Thats our overall concept and its gonna look sort of vegetable and be in bright vegetable colours ME Um Uhhuh ME So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the LCD or would it be on the outer Okay UI I think its on the Mmmm PM Imagine it would be inside PM So um actually that could like really cut down your thing so youve got your outside which is like minimalist and then you open it up and youve got a screen and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons into ID Mm ME Mmhmm ME Yeah okay ME Mmhmm PM Um so youve still not got like a lot of stuff in the Youve maybe got you know like if youre modelling on iPod youve got five buttons and a wheel and four of the buttons are in the wheel and the other ones the little bit inside the wheel yeah UI Yeah UI On the Mmhmm UI In the centre yeah sure ME Mm yeah UI Okay so now weve got thirty minutes before our next meeting UI In the meantime the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design which Ill presume hell work out what that means ID Mmhmm UI Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation UI And as well as that the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that weve just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach ME Mmhmm ID Cool UI Is that all okay UI And anyone who hasnt put their their presentation in the project documents folder it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it ME Yeah ID Yeah okay ME Mmhmm PM Cool Im gonna go and sit on my own UI Y ah nobody wants to talk to you PM I know Im hated UI Unplug yourself ME Hmm PM Ive got a bit tangled up in all this,"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The industrial designer begins presenting, first describing the insides of a remote control. He lists the options for types of batteries, shapes for the remote case, materials to use, and functions to include such as push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require. The interface specialist begins presenting, first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes. She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance, and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel. The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends. She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular, meaning curviness and assymetry are in. The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style. They discuss what material should be used, talk about how the surface of the case should look, and plan out the general user interface. After they make some decisions about the remote, the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting."
ID Im proud of it UI Okay UI This is our final meeting the detailed design meeting UI And again Ill take minutes UI The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two so you can show us what youve been working on so diligently ME Yeah UI Um then then Cats going to present the evaluation criteria that were going to be evaluating this against PM It does look very cool UI Then I need to say some st a few things about finance cause we have to check that its within the finance criteria UI Um and then well be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits UI Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that weve been through UI So weve got forty minutes PM And then do we get to make a remote control UI S Cause we missed out PM Yeah UI So its now I guess that were supposed to start at fifteen thirty five so weve got until four fifteen ID Uhhuh UI Is that right ID How how much do we have forty minutes ME Yeah about four fifteen yeah UI Yeah until about four fifteen PM Yeah ID Yeah UI So yeah ID Okay so UI Go for it UI Do you want Yes ME So you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well but its its just an a approximation ID Presentation ID Okay ID Okay ID So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana ID Um Yeah PM You think bananas are a safe thing to use PM Its a bit um phallic ID Um Yeah UI Dual use perfect UI Dual use perfect PM Oh your remote control PM Oh thats just bad UI Does it vibrate when you press the buttons UI Sorry sorry ID Um so basically its the its the flip open thing again UI Mmhmm ID So now we we have the okay so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there ID And it flips open on the side so it opens like that UI Mmhmm ID And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the LCD and and the scroll are inside UI Wow ID Um well everything else is probably user interface so ID Yeah yeah ME Uh yeah UI And its the whole things made of rubber is that Mmhmm ME Rubber ID Oh yeah ID Yeah it has yeah ME Yeah PM Is it to scale or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ME Um it could be made a bit smaller and and of course it would be and yeah but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing that one side was supposed to be rounder so we said the back side round yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah well but i since its made of rubber anyway ID I I think its its uh Yeah ME Yeah PM It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shapes curvy so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable UI Yeah ME Yeah ID Mm ID Hmm ME And its spongy as well PM I wasnt very keen on that but yeah ME So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things UI Huh UI Mmhmm ME So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one UI Yeah ME So its four up to four up to seven up to nine and zero z zero here UI Six seven eight nine UI I like that ME Yeah ME And then well this is on off button ME Its its quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red so its its kind of user friendly UI Yeah ME And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one UI Uhhuh ME And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here previous and ne prevon prevon next PM So wheres the volume UI Yeah ME The volume is is scrolling ME On the side this one ID Its on the side PM Ah you did get that in then mmhmm ME Yeah you just do it like this ME And and and its its on the back is mm cover or back lid because if you flip it open you can still do the scrolling here PM Oh okay UI Mmhmm ME See ME So the volume is you just scroll but then once you flip it open okay there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose UI Yeah UI Mmhmm ME You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen you just push the cen mm the middle button UI Mmhmm PM Cool PM Oh the thing we forgot was like a mute button ME A mute button ID Uh no we wed not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials PM Yeah ME Well well have this on the screen on the display UI Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you PM On the wheel like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute ID Uh on the LCD we r you know the main menu will have various options ME Well but the but the mute yeah the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right UI But if you hold it in if its a scroll and click so you hold it in PM Yeah but its a scroll and click isnt it ID Mm ME Okay yeah okay PM Okay cool PM So that that solves the whole mute issue ID Mm ME Yeah ME And okay so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it ME You cant really see it in the interface UI no ID Yeah its hidden in there somewhere ME Yeah ME And we do have the logo on it as well UI Mmhmm very good ME So I think it Yeah UI And its with the the black and yellow youre even in the right colours ME Yeah I think um we could do l the logo in grey as it is on the website ID Cool UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID We ran out of resources here so ME In the actual one ME Yeah ME So if you have questions ID You can have a look UI Very good lets have a look UI Test it out UI Uh its a sort of intermediate colour I guess PM Yeah oh we hold the remote PM Oh but it it does feel all cold and slimy PM I hate PlayDo its just minging PM But yeah uh thats cool cool UI Very good PM Mmhmm UI Okay so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then well there I suspect were gonna have a couple of minor finance issues but um well se Im sure we can get around them somehow PM Okay ID Yeah see the budget UI Well just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way PM Wales UI Wales for example PM Mm PM Cool okay PM Right okay PM Fabulous yeah UI Marketing Expert PM Okay cool PM So what were gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design UI Mmhmm PM Um so were gonna be using a seven point scale so one is you know yes it totally meets with that requirement and seven is no it really doesnt we need to go back and start again PM Um you know PM Basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that weve done and weve worked on and like made a list of them PM Um you know so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah we did manage to do that or oh no we really forgot about that ME Yeah UI Mmhmm PM Okay PM Cool so these are what they are PM Oh Yes I did have A B C and D down here but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points UI So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven UI Is that right UI Mm dots never mind PM Okay PM But if you can imagine that they say A B C and D then that would be really good ID I guess well give it maximum points in everything ME Yeah the yeah its definitely attractive UI Yeah I agree ME Oh the locatable thing we actually forgot PM Well I thought wed um kinda said that youd have a little thing to stick on the TV ME Yeah UI Yeah just prepare one now ME Shall I just prepare it now PM Yeah ME It will be red too PM Cool PM Okay PM So be attractive to look at PM Thats this one PM What do you all say ID So UI I reckon it Yeah ME S seven was th the maximum yeah PM Yeah ME I I go for seven UI Seven yeah its terribly sexy PM Oh were all so proud of the ID Yes UI Yeah PM Okay so thatll be a seven for A PM Could oh no you cant whilst thats up there PM Okay um uh what Ive done on the next page is Ive set it up so we just put the marks in UI Ah okay ID Okay UI Excellent UI Except we cant uh we can if we then yeah Ill take a note its fine PM Yeah PM But thats alright ID But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for righthanded people than for lefthanded people so if youre lefthanded youre kind of left uh scrolling with your finger PM If you take a note of them and then Ill put them in in a minute PM Okay so were all agreeing on seven for A UI Yeah PM Cool okay PM Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ME I would think yes yeah UI I think it does PM Yeah PM I mean Yeah ME Yeah so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version which is like exactly the mirror image of this one UI Alright UI But thats gonna be a problem cause you dont always have all lefthanders or all righthanders in a family ID But then yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah ID So bu its its not a huge problem because i i it is operatable PM I th I think its not its not like its a pen ME But then then I think lefthanded people are already used to discrimination anyway so they just Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah but I mean because its not like its a pen you know lefthanded people cant normally write righthanded but they can normally do most things righthanded so I would say its not such a big issue UI Yeah ID Right ME Yeah because I mean anyway righthanded people would be able to scroll with it so i if the majority are righthanded its uh Or maybe six because its just one one i one among the issues I mean UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah PM I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb UI Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Yep PM So I mean that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue ID Mm PM So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation maybe give it a five I would say UI Um Six PM What do you what do you all think ID Mm UI Yeah I think I think for um I mean most people are righthanded so in in terms of our greatest target group I think its pretty good but we might want to flag it for management they want might want to um They Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Yeah ID One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens on the side PM Okay ME No yeah but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah ID So Yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah ME So it wont be a problem it will be and it will be it wont be heavy UI Yeah PM Yeah ID So you guys can decide wh whether Oops PM Yeah PM I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top ME Yeah well yeah but its its a bit long ID Yeah but we which makes it kind of really big yeah UI The length is gonna be difficu Mm ME Its a little bit long PM Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller yeah ME Well I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah ID Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two it might interfere with the IR channel PM Because So you have to keep that side flat ME S uh slightly smaller ME Yeah but if we flip it open only as much as that ID Okay PM So it works like a mobile phone flipping but y you know as long as that sides flat than that will work ID Right PM Okay ID Okay PM Um okay so C PM Are are we admitting defeat on C or are we saying were gonna stick a locator on the TV UI No were gonna put it like weve got th theres the locator dot ID No we have a locator PM Theres a locator PM Cool so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though doesnt it ME Mm that you stick on TV UI Mm PM To make it beep ME Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds so yeah ID Yeah PM Or a buzzer UI Yeah PM Okay ID Yeah PM So thats two so thats seven yeah PM Its locatable ME Yep PM Fabulous PM D ID Intuitive completely intuitive ME Yeah ME If uh uh if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and its I th I think its Yeah UI Yeah UI Id say six cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one rather than the way youve got it UI I really like the way you have it but its not the immediate thing that youre used to PM Yeah ID Intuitive PM Yeah and I mean d So should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive but its different so do you know I mean its obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first UI So Might be But it and its something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon ID And uh even the scroll its a its a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh its a good technology I mean once they get used to it ID Yeah ID So l Yeah okay UI Five UI Yeah PM So we give that one a five you think UI Im happy with five PM Yep ID Im gonna give a seven in everything so ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Im glad youre accepting this PM It has taken a little while hasnt it PM Um intuitive but Sorry its really hard to write on those PM I just went a bit mad didnt I ID Mm PM Um okay cool E okay PM Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here so possibly for lefthanded PM Investigate UI Yep UI But otherwise its superb PM So should we give it a six UI Six PM Six ME Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno I mean the the repetitive stress things but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah unless you are a all the time sitting ME See ME Yeah so its kinda Yeah ID Yeah UI Well weve banned them from Yeah ID Yeah I I think it is ergonomic PM I used to send fifty texts a day you know and I never got repetitive strain injury from that so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest ID Mm yeah ID And moreover it it has um LCD and everything so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway UI Yeah its varied UI Yeah PM Okay so we give that a six yeah UI Six PM Okay F ME Yeah it does have yeah UI Voice control have seven ID Absolutely PM Hang on how come its showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there PM Thats just Oh okay cool UI Ah thats the second one UI So you must have changed it on this one where its got score but not on the previous slide PM Um right so ID So it has voice control PM Yes so thats a seven then ID Yep PM Um cool UI G technologically innovative ID Anyway it ha yeah its the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen ME Technologi well Yeah UI But in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually new ME Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well which is yeah its kind of new UI Yeah PM Yeah but I mean you dont Theyre never been used i theyve never been using remote remote control before I dont think UI All of the components have been used in other things before ME But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new ID Yeah but theyve been brought together in a remote UI But do yeah yeah UI Yeah UI What do you reckon five six PM Yeah what do you all think ME Six PM Six ID Yeah ME I mean how how far can you go with a remote control really PM Well thats it I mean Yeah but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasnt it ME It still has to do what i what it has to do UI Yeah PM So I dont think many peop Thats it they can take it with them UI Space remote UI Put fashion in electronics ID Absolutely ME Yeah isnt it fashionable ME Yeah sure ID The carrot banana remote ME Its the maximum fashion PM So we give it seven and we write There we go ME Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days so ME So I think weve done very well but Whats the assessment ID I think thats a PM Cool UI Very good ID Yeah PM So we need the average here so we got Seven So weve got four sevens so thats twenty eight three sixes eighteen ME The average is about six and something UI Yeah one ME A little bit over six UI Or a seven ID There are how many sixes ME No wait a little bit under six ID One two three ME No wait ID Three ID And one five ME Oh three sixes okay yeah UI Fifty one one two three four five six seven eight ID Okay twenty eight thirty eight fo forty six ME Four sevens ID Forty six and five fifty one UI Six point point about six point five ID Fifty one divided by Mm I guess itll have to wait for a bit ME Six point something yeah PM Two three four Seven eight ME Six point five yeah UI Close enough PM Okay thats pretty good I think UI Now wait until we get to finance and then well see if we can afford it UI Thats all youve got at the moment or did you have anything more PM Um no thats it yeah UI Thats it UI Alright UI So finance UI And well see if we can unscrew this first PM Cool there we go UI Sorry this is Im just um Beautiful PM There we go and there are the marks ME Yeah UI Not anymore UI Computer no signal UI Adjusting UI There we go UI Okay so weve looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria UI And now we have to calculate the production costs UI So Ive got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that UI Can you read that UI Almost UI More or less UI Um I started filling it in but of course these are provisional so we have to go down UI No hand dynamo right PM Yeah ME Yeah UI One simple battery ID Mm UI No kinetic energy no solar UI The chip were going for an advanced chip on print ID Advanced yeah UI We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker ME Yep UI Um singlecurved surface so that we can fold it ME Yeah yes UI Case material we said rubber ME Rubber ID Yep UI I dont know what special colour means ID Mm anything uh I think which is not more ME I think something coloured yeah probably ME So I think this is probably special co no UI It could be Rub rubber comes coloured its I would maybe its like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured its different ID Yeah PM Yeah but rubber comes coloured doesnt it PM You know ME Yeah ME Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it yeah yeah okay UI Yeah lets leave it as zero cause its easy ME Yeah PM Yeah you might end up having to take off the sample sensor UI We were definitely going to have to so weve got pushbutton and then weve Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had no ME We have pushbuttons scro we have scroll wheel as well ID Mm UI S for the muting ME S yeah yeah we had for muting yeah ID No uh we we have uh yeah UI Yeah ME And we have LC display and yeah UI And button supplements ME Um Yeah but what do we ha we have LC display but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah ID Mm no PM No ID We dont have were not using any of that UI No UI No UI But the the spinning wheels not there UI I have think maybe its integrated with the LC display ME Okay lets yeah PM Weve got more than one pushbutton though havent we UI I think the pushbutton oh PM Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesnt it UI I dont know if thats one Yeah PM Not counting anything wed still be in budget UI That seems unlikely UI Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I dont think that makes sense ID Huh ID Wh wh what is the limit ID Uh PM Twelve point five ME We have to count all of them or yeah ID Mm I dont think so no PM No PM Well it doesnt but it uh And LC display ID No it says what what is the kind of interface if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five its a scroll wheel so we weve put its pushbutton and scroll wheel and LCD display so thats thats the three kind of interfaces that we have UI No UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI So as we can see thats way too expensive down here ID Wh wh whats our criteria PM This sample sensor UI Our budgets twelve point five ID Uh okay PM Yeah the sample sensor will have to go cause thats the most expensive thing on there UI Yeah so that has implications though for the ID Uh it does not have for voice recognition but it does have for the feedback speaker ID when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello PM Yeah UI For the locator PM But thats a bit of a gimmick anyway really isnt it UI Yeah ID Mm and the locator also goes away PM We can afford to get rid of it ME But it was very no innovative innovativeness UI Yeah PM So that means no locator does it ME Well um yeah PM I mean does Yeah UI What else does it need ME Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps UI Yeah cause the sample speaker was I think more complicated then just a beeping thing ME This would be Yeah yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah then then we would be in the b budget PM Yeah UI Yeah okay so we Uhhuh ID A also i in the case Im not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because its just rubber so its probably a flat surface rubber ID Uh I mean uh um yeah PM Okay yeah UI Right so we need one fifty off ID Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the LCD PM See I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing cause But thats well you would just have to to spin it down UI Take it down to just a scroll wheel UI We could do Yeah ID If in the LCD we can scroll right ID But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button ME Yeah b no no you can push this one but we dont have a pushbutton uh we ca we dont have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing UI You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute ME Mmhmm PM So thats point three ID No w w w but ha its its the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing ME But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well ME If you Mm PM Yeah I mean that wouldnt actually cost any more PM Thats the spin wheel though isnt it PM Didnt that come with the LC Yeah UI Thats with the LC We decided cause its not on our list ID That comes with the LCD PM Yeah ID Oh so so the the this is UI The scroll wheel is on the side ID So were adding costs for right okay uh I mean I think this is good ME So Mmhmm PM S so were point three over UI Were point three over at the moment UI Its nothing n Yeah I have Yeah PM Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume PM Could b still put them on the side PM But yeah PM I mean the scroll wheels pretty cool but Yeah ID Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here up for up and down PM Yeah ID On the side ID Mm uh it sounds good actually yeah ME Okay yeah UI Rather than having three different things that people have to do ME Okay UI There we go UI Oh look were way under budget and well make huge profits and well all get bonuses PM Yeah well we could admit to the single curve couldnt we UI Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour PM Yeah but Yeah UI So thats alright UI We well leave it at that and then Ill take I can send it back to management and say we werent quite sure about the colour if that costs extra then weve still got some space for it yeah ID We have yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah UI Excellent UI Alright UI So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria as a result of doing that PM No PM No I dont think so ID Not really no ID Because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep LCD display UI Mm PM Yeah ID We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons UI Yeah PM We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was its not a great difference I dont think UI Yeah ID Um yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah UI Alright then ID But we lose the locator PM Really UI Were gonna have a beep ME Well were going to have a beeping thing ID So instead of speaker ME But yeah its its not like sample speaker but it will just beep so we still have the locate UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Kay PM Cool PM Thats not a very exciting colour PM I think you should make it more vegetablelike ME Which colour the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well UI Tha PM Oh the the beeper thing PM It Yeah I think Jen wants it to vibrate ME It can come in the same colour as the the case UI Cause we we wont have run out of our pot of PlayDoh PM You know your pen vibrates UI Yeah I know I know my pen vibrates PM Yeah UI But only for a very short time UI Um okay UI So looks like weve designed a banana UI Well done team UI Um we need weve just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went um so that we can feed back to the management for next time theyre designing a product PM Cool UI Feedback ID I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with UI Ideas ME Yeah mm as far as creativity is concerned yeah I think there was there was room for creativity ME The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Um we kap kept a adding things randomly UI Yeah ID So had we known Yeah that or not yeah PM If wed had that sheet at the beginning shouldve been like okay so we can have that lot lets just throw it together and do what we can UI Mmhmm ME Yeah yeah yeah ID Yeah ID So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented PM Yeah ID Mm UI But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting that that worked in terms of ID Yeah mm PM I think cause the meetings were so regular you know UI Mmhmm PM It wasnt like we were alone for very long so you didnt st go off and think wouldnt it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana and then you know come back three days later and Jens going look look it vibrates and it looks like a banana UI Mmhmm UI Banana ME Yeah PM Um yeah so yeah ME Yeah the m the means were very very good the means we used UI Mmhmm the whiteboard digital pens ME And the pens PM Uh I like the pens UI We like the pens PM I want one PM That would just be so cool to d do all your notes and s I dont think you should say that was the recording UI Yeah you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office ID Yeah yeah yeah thats its its I wonder what one of these costs ME Yeah yeah UI They great UI Do you think theyd notice if one went UI Oh okay PM Okay cover up the microphone PM Alright lets take it UI Yep UI Shh UI Yep PM Okay UI But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that its so static and you cant change it once youre in there yep PM It is a bit limiting isnt it ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah PM Yeah PM The thing flew in you didnt have the whole whooshing thing cause there wasnt time for that so yeah UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Thats alright that always irritates me anyway yeah PM Not that you can do that on the board either PM We could make some little Yeah totally I mean that was fairly tight anyway I mean especially with that lastminute alteration ME But yeah but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting yeah UI Mm ME Yeah UI Yeah ID Mm yeah PM back it this is just had to be changed PM And yeah so cool UI Yeah PM Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now UI And presumably you dont you can say nasty things as well ME Yeah ME I was I was satisfied with with the leadership yeah UI I have no stake in it PM Yeah definitely ID Yeah PM You werent like a a dictating leader so that was always good UI You have to say that cause Im taking the notes ME Mmhmm UI Ill leave the room and you can have another go PM I know youve got the pen you might attack me with it UI Better than that than the banana ME And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely yeah UI I think it worked quite well PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ME To express them mm mm no ID Mm ID I guess it was a fairly small group so all of us got to express our opinions yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah UI New ideas found UI Not quite sure what about ME Well its its its pretty new pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really all this flipping open thing and Yeah neither neither do I but Ive never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this actually so UI Yeah ID Mm UI Yeah PM I dont know I dont go shopping for remote controls that often maybe somebodys already though of it UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Hmm PM Yeah PM Ill be looking out next time I need to write an essay UI Yeah thats right PM That looks boring Ill see if anyones made a remote control ME Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one PM Yeah yeah ID Yeah ME Patent patent patent UI Banana remote PM I think wed like to think the ideas were new but weve got no way of finding out ME Mm UI Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control PM That vibrates Yeah but that would just come up with like other things really wouldnt it UI Flip UI Vibrate UI And uh yeah UI Nothing that you really want UI True UI Yeah UI Okay UI So costs are within budget well within budget including a little what have we got ME Yes PM Yes UI One Euro left over for bits that we didnt foresee UI Um weve evaluated the project ME Yes UI Youve got the scores PM And its fabulous UI Can you put that in the project documents file PM Its in the project documents UI Its in there already UI And the process wheel didnt really have any major problems with UI Were there any was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didnt go as smoothly as youd hope ME And my main difficulty was the the time pressure UI Yeah ME Otherwise its its all fine PM Yeah yeah sometimes its like a little bit rushed ID Mmhmm ID I thought that was good though because if youre given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah ID Although we could have made the Rs better had we had five more minute ME Yeah UI Okay then UI Um I think were still well within our time PM Yeah weve got like five minutes left UI Weve got about five minutes left but if weve finished then weve finished ME Yeah UI Were just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time ID We certainly are mm PM Yeah ID Yeah ME Yes UI So I would say thats the end of that meeting ME Yeah it was a pleasure working with you UI Thank you team PM Kay UI It was very productive day and Mm uh no ID Yeah same here PM We could draw animals on the board again ID Mm uh no ID I dont think so ME You can make some animals PM I dont like PlayDoh no ME Oh you dont like anim It doesnt PM Its just minging PM It smells so bad PM It does ME Smells quite nice ME Smells very sweet PM Mm UI Right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it ID Was there a questionnaire already sent UI I dont know if its already sent or not PM No it hasnt been UI Um presumably I have to I dont see why you cant stay here really PM Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now PM Okay so the other way UI Did I save this one UI Production costs ME I made your animal for you UI It was supposed to be pink UI But it was blue on the board,"The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete."
ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID Ooh PM So were kay PM On the or No PM I dunno where to put it cause the Okay PM Could you s take it off ME Is that alright ME or Okay PM Okay ME Keeps coming off ME S fiddly ID Hmm ME Right ID How do we sta wa how do we start ID Does anybody know ME Oh another one ID So thats this Oh okay right PM Are we free to take notes uh Okay ID Uh ID Hmm ID Okay just hang on a second everybody ID I havent actually looked at this yet ME Ah ID um I havent looked at it but lets just start it off and well see what happens ME Very nice ID If youre all ready UI Yeah ID So is the agenda ID Opening acquaintance tool training and project plan discussion and then closing ID Project aim is a new remote control ID Its original uh trendy and its userfriendly ME Kay ID Project method functional design individual work another meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting of details design individual work and a meeting ID Tool training ID Try out the whiteboard every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal ME Okay ID Um ID Uh Miss Industrial Designer would you like to go first PM Okay PM So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm ID Yeah why dont you just c I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ME Clip ID Or put em in your pocket yeah PM Yeah PM okay PM So my favourite animal Kay um Um okay its big its got a great memory ID Yeah whats your favourite animal ME Ah ID Is it rude ME Its an elephant ID Thats a very good elephant UI The back end of an elephant ME Oh my gosh Im never gonna be able to draw that well ID Kay and you want to write up on there it says youve gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal ME Does it ME Oh PM Supposed to have a great memory we say an elephant never forgets ID Mm ME Mm PM And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me ID Okay PM Nice animal ID Wonderful well done ID Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off PM Okay ID And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next UI Aesthetic yep sure ME I have no idea what my favourite animal is UI Kay my favourite animal uh lets see ME Oh ME Its A what UI Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before UI Its a liger a combination of a lion and tiger ID No ME Alright UI Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ME How ID No PM No ME No UI Oh its a hilarious movie UI You have to see it UI And and its best characteristic is its pretty much the awesomest animal UI But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it ID Okay well done ME Great ME Me ID Yeah ID Miss mar Miss Marketing ME Okay ME Not quite sure how this is gonna work UI There go ME Cool ME Uh well Ill try my best to draw ME Can I just draw the face ID Um yeah I think you can just draw the face but then youll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks ME Ooh ME Its a cat ID Thats a very pr pretty cat ME Which also has what ME A big fat body and big and a long tail ID Okay do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ME Why ME Because um cuddly ME And usually cats are very friendly ME Usually ME And theyre healing as well ME They heal ME And they can feel when a humans got problems so So thats why I like cats ID Wow so theyre kinda spiritual ID Well done ME There we are thats me ID Okay ME Mm ID Um I dont actually have a favourite animal but for the for th for this meeting Ill s draw a little Uh ME Mmhmm ID I honestly cant draw for toffee ID Uh PM Really PM Oh thats a Not bad I would say ID Yeah ID no no uh Thats exactly what it is UI A prairie dog UI Oh a squirrel ID Uh not a very good one Okay well you got its a s Its a squirrel and I like them because theyre cute and stupid UI Yeah thats pretty good PM Very good ME Ah UI Alright ID Right ID Okay so I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working ID Mm ID Lets move on to the next page ID Okay project finance selling price twenty five Euros profit aim fifty million Euros ME Market range internationally sold ID Yeah ID Production cost ah right its gotta be cant cost any more than twelve fifty to make ME Ah right okay ID experience with with remote control so talk about who whos used what ID Any ideas ID Stuff like that ID Next meeting starts in thirty minutes ID At quarter to twelve UI So I think before we close uh we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where UI I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide UI Uh S Yeah I think were I mean before we close the meeting were supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah ID Oh k so were actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay ME Yeah PM Mm UI Yeah ID I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next but Okay UI Yeah I think this is just the preliminary get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe ID Right whos got experiences with remote controls then ID Pretty much everybody PM Yeah UI Yeah I think weve all got Mm ME Uh ID Um PM Is this a TV one we are supposed to make ME Yeah ME Yeah its a TV remote control PM Okay ID Kay um ME Well PM T But how do we know how much uh I mean how much do we have per how much ME A new remote control for TV ME What would I like ID W what You want it big do you want it small ME Um ME Medium ID Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something thats thats big and Video and ts hifi and stuff UI Yeah it seems like theres like theres sort of a tension between two ideas I mean you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of TV and if you have whatever associated with TV the DVD player or something like that but like at the same time you dont wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something ID Maybe you yeah now th thats the other thing is its gotta be cheap UI Mm UI Yeah ID Cause I I I mean I was thinking something thats got different like maybe a a an LCD display on it thats got different pages for different devices but that would p that would probably be quite expensive ME Mm ME Twelve fifty PM Twelve fifty UI It g cant be more than twelve fifty per unit ME Each ID Per unit yeah UI Cost PM So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I dont know how much it would cost ID Well at the moment we could wa I mean we cause we this is what we th what were doing at the moment is just saying what what wed like and then after we after weve found out what we can like some different ideas we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not ME Guess Couldnt we have like one that comes out PM Yeah PM Right ID So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things UI Yeah ID Um ME Like so you have one in like mm it doesnt have to be really thick PM Yeah ME I mean remote controls can be thin bits ME And then you have one for your DVD and you sort of slide it out and then you have another one you slide it out ID Kay ME have slides ME And then it all comes compact into one ID Okay thats ME So its not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner and um into one basically ID Th thats an idea UI Yeah ME So you just flip them out ID Okay PM Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR access and stuff and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel program plus and minus and the just the mute button for example PM I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated ID One side for kids one side for adults PM Yeah UI Im not sure if thats like Im not sure if its a good idea to have a two sided remote though cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it PM Or grandma as well you know its like what is the mute button PM No but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldnt be able to press the buttons but Start breaking up UI Oh UI Oh okay ID Like it or something like a flip telephone something like that maybe UI Yeah UI Okay ME That would be cool ME I was thinking that like a flip ID F flip it open and youve got all the buttons or you flip it closed and youve just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe UI Mmhmm ID Um oh weve got five minutes left ME Okay ID But okay ME Um ID Well weve got a k weve got a few ideas there UI Yeah we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have UI Okay UI Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface but the the functions that were sure that we want are that it can control the TV but also devices connected to the to the TV I mean be able to operate DVD players things like that ID Yeah ID I have got I think we should also have a backup plan of I cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we dont we havent been told it has to be something that will control everything UI Yeah ID We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control that just that is just for a TV but its just a really good nice one PM Yeah UI Okay UI Right ID What do you reckon UI Yeah I mean ID See cause Im just thinking bearing in mind th weve gotta we have to have something thats cheap to make UI Yeah thats true maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good TV remote and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so its comfortable to use uh simple to use and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people certain certain demographic Yeah no I think youre right ID I think well be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker ID Yeah ID May w you know maybe even Or maybe even so something thats for disabled people or so people that uh b dont see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah ME But whatll make it whatll make it interesting for people to buy though ME I mean if its if its just like Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Or just one that looks really fucking cool PM Could be really light or I dunno something special UI Yeah rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah ID Otherwise well be well be here all day talking about do this lets do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah PM Yeah cause at the end of the day if it says just TV remote doesnt say com combination with all all the r Mm UI Yeah ID I mean obviously everyone were uh you know uh sounds like were all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once but you know thats Yeah UI Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside ME Mm ID Yeah thats right ID Yeah ID I mean Id like one that makes tea as well but thats not gonna happen ME I think a flip up thing cause you always have this problem of like if its on this well I did anyway like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach and youd come and sit down and ooh the telephones the television switched on or something ME So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes so you dont accidentally press a button or record button for something ID Okay like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones yeah ME Yeah ME But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it ME So make it Yeah ID Yeah its gotta be sellable ME Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah thats true what you were saying I mean it doesnt have to have a flip function it can just have a lock function so that its not uh not usable when you dont want it to be usable ME Mm ID Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay ME And even for kids as well ME Its um its safer for them I guess ME Like they dont flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto ID No porn channel for children PM Okay ID Okay ID Um alright so weve got some ideas weve got um Lets move on UI I guess thats good good for now ME Mm ID Oops lets close that ID Next meeting uh okay ME W What does IDVIDNME stand for ID Industrial Designer um which is Um ME Ah ri okay ME these are requirement specification PM Thats Mm ME And Im marketing ID Yeah there you go ID So User Interface Designer thats thats thats you so you gotta you go youre youre gonna be the one thats working out what what buttons we need UI Thats me UI Okay UI Right UI Right ID Um ID Industrial Designer you are the one you know youre gonna be working out kind of box it goes in I guess so um whether its what goes into the box somehow PM Mm PM Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap because Yeah ID And in marketing User requirements specifications ME These are requirement specification ME So what the user requires in a remote ID Yeah what Right okay yeah UI Yeah it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap ME I guess thats what it says ID You two you two are gonna be just I think you just double up you know you working together UI Yeah ID Youre the one thats gotta go and find out do th do the research see what people want in a remote what buttons are used more often and s stuff like that ME Mm ID Oh weve been warned to finish the meeting now ID Okay ID Okay everyone well done ID Good meeting UI Alright see you in thirty minutes ID Yeah ME So do we take these off,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals. The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote. The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members.
ID Think we can first UI Right it was function F eight or something PM Mm UI This one right there PM Tha Okay UI Okay PM Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation UI Think we all Huh PM You will as well UI Oh I thought we all were UI Yeah I have one too okay PM Okay UI S Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay PM Yep ID Right ID I just wanna cause basically I cant re Ive really crap at remembering everyones name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again PM Okay Im Okay ID just gonna leave this up here cause Ill you know UI Yeah UI Sure thats a good idea ID So Okay and Gabriel PM Im Catherine with a C PM CATH ER INE UI Uh Gabriel ID EL is it UI EL ID Kay ID And youre s r REISS Okay ME I am Reissa ME REISSA ME Double S A yeah yeah ME Sorry ID S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think PM Right PM True ID Uh right ME Mm kay ID Okay right welcome to meeting B ID Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting basically uh cause I know what Im supposed to be doing now ID I am your Project Manager and uh yeah Im just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going get people talking and and Im gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically ID Um right this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um Im gonna have some presentations from all three of you what youve been working on for the last wee while when you havent been getting hit with spam on your computers and and you know filling out silly questionnaires and things ID But hopefully youve been actually been doing something productive ID So were gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation ME Mm ID Um ID Then were gonna work you know from each of your presentations ID Well well uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all ID Um and then well yeah well sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it PM How long is the meeting ID This meeting its not very long ID Its uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now PM Okay ID So I want each of your presentations to not be too long five five minutes something like that PM No problem ID Um if you havent done a PowerPoint thingy it doesnt matter it it just it just says that you its thats just one particular medium ID If you havent had time to prepare one you can draw stuff on the noteboard you can talk to us you can you know however you want to do your little presentation basically you can ID Dont feel pressurised into using this thing ID Cause I dont ID Uh okay ID So um ID You okay over there ID Reissa are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ME Im fine ME Yeah ME I uh yeah yeah UI Think shes finishing up her presentation ME D I mean I Im finishing off my presentation ME No no ME Uh Im done ME Okay ID Okay jolly good ID Alright lets have um well we all know that its its a remote control that were gonna be dealing with ID I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be ME Mm ID So thats gonna be you Catherine if we wanna hear from you first PM Okay PM Okay PM Um just connecting this PM Are we getting i Really ID You dont have to worry about screwing it in just there you go PM Okay PM Cool PM Okay PM So Ive got a very quick uh Uh PM Okay PM So the working design Ive got a very quick presentation on this so um Ive oh no you cant see a thing PM Oh well Im gonna draw it on the board then PM Its in blue uh and I couldnt change it UI Oh PM We its fine on my screen but never mind ID Ah PM So um the idea is that weve got the energy source um which in our case will pr oh well okay never mind PM So um I think maybe uh two batteries I dunno what theyre called six or something like that ID Mmhmm PM Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal which could be uh an infrared signal um which will be sent by an electronic chip PM And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface PM So well hear about that later from Gabriel ID Mmhmm PM And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infrared signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels PM Um and thats it really for the working design ID Great ID Okay PM Sorry the presentation wasnt very uh clear but Really ID I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally PM Cool ID Yeah PM Um should I erase this or Okay ID Do you wanna just give us a moment I just wanna copy this down ID Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this PM Fine PM Or suggestions ME Is a battery like the only way of No no No I meant like No cause like cha cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying PM Well its just you dont want it plugged in really s In indoors UI Yeah alternate energy source like win wind power or Bicycle power ID Yeah you blow on it and i Yeah its worked for the last fifty years you know ME The batterys down and maybe I dunno solar charged PM I dunno swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain but Yeah ME Mm ME Yeah UI One question I have and I dont know how much control we have over this is um as far as the infrared signal do we have control over you know how far away you can be from the receiving unit the the TV and still have it be operational UI I mean maybe we want one with a strong signal stream ID How far away is your television ID Its never gonna be more than its never gonna be you kno unless youve got a TV the size of a football pitch its not doesnt have to go that far does it UI Uh Thats true PM Well the thing is uh you you dont Well we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it ID Doesnt have to go through a wall because youre not gonna be looking through a wall ME Yeah but if like youre on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you dont really want to go into the put the telephone down and go into the other room PM I didnt think about that but Why not ME How about Bluetooth ME Instead of using infrared use Bluetooth ME Isnt that a better signal PM I just think that its its gonna cost more and Im Im not sure its youre gonna use it ID Yeah yeah I d it sounds like you you w dont wanna overcomplicate things ME Mm ID You know we dont need it PM Its a fancy idea uh its quite nice but then I dont th I dunno either you if you wanna watch the telly youre in the room you are gonna But Oh we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage maybe I dont Do you need the border ID Yeah exactly ID Basically were were desi were designing and marketing a television remote control unit ID Were not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff ID Its uh Okay ME Mm ME S just an idea ID Right well done Catherine ID Um Gab Gabriel lets uh lets hear from you on on on such things UI Okay UI Uh Im just gonna use the PowerPoint uh PM Okay PM Sorry UI Technical UI Okay ME Adjusting UI Okay so while this is warming up there it is uh ME Yeah UI So Im doing the user interface design ID Mmhmm UI Yeah and basically uh as far as methods I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there UI Thinking of what we can retain what we can do away with uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um UI we dont want to do something thats too radical of a change I guess I mean people want a remote thats familiar that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics but Um so we can improve whats out there and maintain that the basic functionality that people want ID Mm yeah UI Um so things that seem like absolute musthaves uh would be a volume control um so updown keys for that uh channel keys updown but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want rather than doing updown and uh a mute button UI Uh one thing that I didnt include here that I forgot that we talked about last time was doing um some sort of lock uh function UI Uh I dont I dunno uh thats one possibility ID Okay UI And so in the research that I was doing theres basically two types of remotes ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred which I dont know if I can access the web page from here but I can show you uh UI Yeah UI So this is a engineer centred one so you see its rather busy but it also lets you play your movie stop your movie fastforward all this um freeze frame ID Mmhmm UI Uh and this is a user centred one UI Uh its its easier to g just glance at this and see whats possible to do youre not gonna be staring at it for five minutes ID Yeah ID Great UI And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that thats what we were going after uh or the direction we were going in at least UI Um UI So the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality but it can be a little bit overwhelming so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use UI Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh Reissa because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this ME Mm ID Yeah UI So uh yeah thats me ID Great ID Okay ID Now thats I just have a q a q question for you ID This w um research that youve been doing looki looking at other you know existing units stuff ID Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah UI No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know UI I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones UI That was sort of the inspiration for it UI Um Ive never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business ID Yeah UI Ive havent Ive never seen a locking functionality UI I dunno what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether thats really necessary ID Um I would say its If its simple to do which I think it probably should be even if its a physical you know a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote even something like that um then yes its like you know like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing something like that but you know being physical UI Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Kay UI Right ID Look into ID Um Ive had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well something we should take into account is um weve gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit ID Its gotta d look like its in the R and R UI Mm ID You know the the company its its from what I can see from our other products are yellow with blue writing on them UI Right ME Mm ID Um UI And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics ID We put the fashion in electronics ME Mm UI I think I think we have to carry that mental ID There you go ID So its kinda gotta look its gotta look new and s you know something fashionable ID If if remote control well if telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be UI Mm ME Mm UI Well yeah these I think we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didnt mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design ID Yeah ID Because we need Yeah UI I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here I mean UI Uh everything is going t ergonomic you know theres you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market I guess ID Great ID Okay fantastic UI Um ID Right well done Gabriel ME Okay ID Um Reissa ME Where does it go into ID Lets plug you in baby ME Here UI Yeah ME The blue thing UI Uh yeah this is getting all UI Mm UI Yeah then you just have to do function F eight and it should come up ME Well function F eight ME No oh ID Yeah w it it just takes a wee while UI Yeah it just takes a second uh ME Come on ME Right ME Okay ME Okay ME Well for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out ME Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings ME So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly ME Okay so they dont like the look of the remote control ME Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy ME So I think we all agree with that ME Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user ME So they dont like like the way they operate it doesnt like match how people behave ME Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote so probably if you have like one two three four five the whole up to z ten they probably dont use those they only use the up and down channel ID Cause weve only got five channels ME exactly ME Thats another thing ME Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap ME Not quite sure what they mean zap goes like ID I think thats k flicking quickly between channels UI Yeah you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess ME Yeah ID Yeah ME Mm ME Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote ME I think especially for uh the older generation ME I know my grandmother doesnt like mobile phones takes ages to work how to use ME Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room so nobody can find them UI Mm ME So maybe tracking devices is a good idea ME Um personal preferences ID Wow ID You are a child of technology arent you ME Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use especially for older people ME Um has to look really cool flashy groovy for people to buy it ME And its easy to find so I dont know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether theyd be interested in um voice activating ME So voice activation ME So and this was what we came up with ME Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age sorry age groups ME So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes ID So there you go yeah ME Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didnt want a voice activated one ME And neither did the older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for like who have most of the money nowadays do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote ID Uh but do the younger generation have the money UI No I would I would say the older the older people yeah ID They they dont ID Its older generation theyre the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f theres a big drop off there ME Well the twenty five to thirty five year old and thirty five and the thirty five to forty five forty five point seven per cent say no so So they dont Well These guys are growing up ID For people up to the age of thirty five youre kinda saying yeah they want it ID Um but no theyre not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five uh cause theyre the ones that have been working for twenty years UI Yeah that would be my guess as well ID Um d and tha and thats a thats quite a minority there so yeah its not even like fifty fifty thats th thirty five per cent UI What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost UI I mean if if its twelve fifty per unit ID Yeah UI I mean okay theres Uh ME Voice activation might not be the best ID I would say scra Id say scrap that straight off ME Um also with um with buttons a thing called RSI so wrist sense Huh UI Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm ME Yeah repetitive strains injury so they dont I think people who watch TV maybe too often keep changing channel hurts their wrist ME I dont think so PM Well maybe they shouldnt watch so much TV then ID So y so its so its so you got so thats something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um theres any w any medical background we can find out about this ME Yeah maybe not so hard UI Mm PM Maybe it could be instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep ME Yeah ID Lets jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people arent gonna sue us in ten years time say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury ME Maybe Mm UI Yeah we should probably consult with our legal department uh ID Yeah ID Theyre having a lunch break at the moment but yeah ME Yeah ID Ill see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting UI Yeah UI I think we can do some really in in that department the the ergonomic department we can make some some really good improvements ID Yeah ME Mm ME Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you dont have to press so much or we just like flat buttons something UI Mm ME Yeah ID Okay ME So that is me ID Thats great thank you very much for that Reissa ID Um okay so weve basically weve decide weve d weve decided that its gonna be you know uh were going for a basic television remote ID Its gotta be safe to use its gotta look cool ME Mm ID Its gotta be cheap ID S um ME Mm ID Now going back to the uh industrial design of it you know we were looking at whether to use maybe infrared or Bluetooth ID I think we should just go with the simplest option on everything uh and that would be infrared energy source that would be batteries ID Uh mean we we can look into using the s you know the little tiny weeny batteries all like special longlasting batteries ID Um ID But a in theres no I dont think theres any point in making a remote control unit thats gonna last for fifty years because technology will have changed and you know we wont have televisions in ten years time ID So I think were all um pretty sussed on that ID Um anyone have any questions ME Mm ID Everybody happy in their work UI Yeah it seems like were all on the pretty much on the same page ID Now this is good weve got a good structure going on ID We all know where were going to ID Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers UI Oh its probably just you cause youre the project manager ME Well just questionnaires ID Yeah UI Sell trying to sell your things ID Yeah stuff ID Um okay ID Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can email stuff to each other ME Yeah you can ID Right UI Okay ID Do all you all know my email address UI No I dont ME I think hes participant one arent you PM Well in the project announcement youve got the addresses I think UI I Uh Oh its just participant one oh okay PM So Project Manager its participant one at AMI UI Yeah ID Can you all d email me your email addresses UI Well its just w its just its just par participant one participant two PM You have them i you have them but well send you an email ID Send me yeah yeah okay PM You want to have friends dont you UI So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe thats our next meeting that we discuss that ID Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ID I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background but I might be just going a bit Okay UI Well its like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders UI Maybe thats like getting ahead of ourselves ID Well maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas PM It wouldnt be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the RR colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the RR logo or colours and If UI Mm ME Cant we have different colours in the remotes so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ID Well see the thing is is weve gotta keep the company image UI Mm ID Its gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that its a Real Reaction i product ME But if its a RR it would be Real Reaction like if it had a symbol on it UI Mm ID Theres loads of companies that called RR UI Mm ME Whoa ID This is slog but this is the slogan this is the the the the type UI And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups so I mean we are sort of beholden to them ID Yeah ME So we have to have it one colour ID Well not necessarily UI Not one colour but the pattern needs to be recognisable ID But we have to incorporate it ME Mm ID Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that its one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a you know a Panasonic product ME Mm ID Its got to so maybe so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein perhaps ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Mm ID Quite poss yeah ID Well this is all your department ID Mm okay ID Well well done everybody ID And um I think we uh stop for lunch now UI Yeah pretty soon I think I guess thats now ME Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ID We might possibly have done PM Cool UI Alright see you all soon ID If weve if weve finished at five minutes before the meetings supposed to finish then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch ME Kay uh ID Yeah there you go ID Right ID I just have to theres a few little bits and pieces I have to write down but Take your headsets off kick back smoke em if you got em,The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals. The user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts. The project manager then introduced some new requirements to bear in mind when designing the remote. The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences on remotes in general and on voice recognition and the team discussed the option to have an ergonomically designed remote. The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote.
ME Oh right okay ME I cover myself up ID I feel like Madonna with one of these on ID I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on ME Ive always wanted one of these I really have ME Where do you buy em from ME Theyre ID Right ID Hello everybody UI Hello ID Back again for another wonderful meeting ID Is uh everyone ready UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Almost ID Okay we c we can hold on for a minute ME Oh my gosh ID I figured with the spam thing if you cant beat it join in UI Thats the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive PM Mm kay ID Are you ready ID Okay right well I take it that you are all ready now ID Um alright first off well just uh recap from our last meeting ID Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing and who we all are and stuff like that mm get bit more of an idea together of whats going on ID Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing now we know that its a TV remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R and D for that thats research and development for those that havent heard that before see Im learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today ME Mmhmm ID Um yeah were gonna hear your uh th three little presentations whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want UI Hmm UI Do you have any preference uh of order ID Um Id like to um hear o Id like to hear whos g whos on the um from from uh Catherine actually first ID I want what Id like to hear about is uh if weve finally decided on um what sort of energy were gonna be using and Its just that yeah lets lets hear from you first ME Batteries UI I think she is still finishing her PM No no no no its fine Im just preparing UI Hmm PM Okay PM Where is that thing UI Okay its uh Is it like a crank thing or something ME Its here PM Oh sorry couldnt see PM Would that work ID Get yourself in position ME Ah PM Okay so thats me again PM Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches if you remember that kind of which wouldnt be v wouldnt be v v yeah yeah ID I dont think any of us remember the fifties PM It wouldnt be very fancy PM You can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days PM So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work ME Mm PM Or you can use solar cells but Im not sure about that indoors really but Yeah UI Well theres sometimes combinations I mean like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power ID Do sol solar panel things do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ME Mm PM I dunno actually ID Does anybody know UI Uh I think it has to be on the on the solar energy but I dont know PM I dunno PM Um PM Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery really ID Okay ME Mm PM And uh if we want something fancier I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice but I dont know if its worth the cost PM So weve got to discuss that ID Mm ID Okay jolly good PM For the case of the remotes itself um they can be a general case which is just a flat one PM You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one if you know what I mean so You know kind of more ergonomic that kind of suits the palm of your hand that kind of thing ID Whats a double curved one PM So Um then the case material itself so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex uh rubber wood or titanium ID Okay PM And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium you cant use it for if you if were choosing a double curved case we cant choose titanium PM And if we are choosing um solar cells then we cant choose latex for the case material so we just have to take that into account PM But if were choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything PM And I think we discussed earlier on the R S I problem thing so we could uh Yeah ID So that might be an idea of using the rubber but then it should you know yeah UI Lets have a squeezable remote PM Yeah PM And also it doesnt break as easily maybe I dunno So rubber would be Okay ID when a TV programmes got one watching the match and your teams just lost you can fuzz it across the room and itll bounce off the wall back at you ME Yeah ID Yeah I like that idea ME Mm ME I think rubbers But after my after my fashion thing I think youll realise that rubber is more People ID Rubber were all were all going were all liking that idea ID You think you can market that PM Uh s so if d okay ID Ooh we like rubber ooh PM And then there are the pushbuttons so you can have basic pushbuttons or a scrollwheels like you have on a mouse um or you could have um LCD which gives you a display PM Um scroll buttons as well ID Uhhuh PM So if you use a rubber double curved case you must use rubber pushbuttons PM So if were going for rubber then we have to decide for the case PM Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber pushbuttons PM So its a constraint ID Well were gonna go with I think weve decided that its gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel PM Yeah but is it a double curved one or not PM If its not a double curved then weve got the choice for the pushbuttons if its a double curve weve gotta go for rubber pushbuttons PM If that makes sense PM Yeah UI If its rubber isnt it malleable anyway it doesnt matter if its double I mean isnt a rubber case mean its completely flexed I mean it it flexes to whatever they want it to UI Mean so whats the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case PM No but na le you see youve got okay the energy thats one thing then you have the case is uh whether its flat or curved ID rubble double double ID Ill have a Big Mac please PM And thats we dont care if its rub rubber or not but then weve decided that we going for rubber for the case material PM So if weve chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether its flat single curved or double curved PM And Im just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why but we need to go for uh rubber pushbuttons UI Okay PM So either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case ID Lets have rubber push buttons hey UI Okay UI Go rubber UI Go rubber the whole way PM Lets go crazy PM And then do I have a last slide PM Yes I do PM Um so the pushbuttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so thats just the electronics between the but behind the pushbuttons ID Yeah PM Um and the price that go with it with it so the simple pushbuttons are gonna be the cheapest PM Uh if we get a scrollwheel thats a higher price range PM If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the LCD the display thing then thats even more expensive ID Simple yeah ID Chip on print ID Its a bit ID Okay uh what Im not understanding here is uh okay advanced chip on print which I presume is like one PCB and thats got all the electronics on one board including the um infrared sender PM Mm PM Yeah PM The infrared PM Yeah ID Right ID Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ID Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print PM Well if if its not chip on print then I guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesnt include the infrared PM Its less expensive mm Technically speaking its not as advanced but it does the job too ID so it sounds So why would we not go for that ID If its something thats inside the the unit PM Fo It doesnt yeah yeah yeah ID I it doesnt affects whether the customers gonna buy it or not PM Totally PM Yeah ID Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works you know PM So lets not go for the Yeah yeah PM I agree ID So lets not lets uh not bother with the chip on print PM So its either um the scrollwheel or the pushbuttons ID Yeah ID S yeah push buttons ME What about the just developed uh sample sensor UI I think pushbuttons is Yeah ID What about what ME G there the sample sensor sample speaker thing PM Well Itd be itd be cool but they are saying theyve just developed it Im just guessing ID Well what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ME Mm I dunno ME Be cool ME Channel two PM But its gonna be the most expensive option probably and Hm ID S Yeah UI Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesnt seem really very promising for us uh cause uh The yeah the example that theyre already using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response and you program the response as well ID Its not something that we wanna t go into with this product UI Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself UI So you can program your coffeemaker that when you say good morning to it it says hello Rick or whatever ID Yeah UI But I mean its not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the TV on like turn the TV on and i turns comes on but its not that UI It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response ME Oh it just gives an answer UI So yeah I mean like whats the point of saying Hello remote I mean hello how how are you ME Oh then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said voice recognition they meant um like channel five and it will change ID Yeah ID Yeah PM Just if you are really lonely maybe UI Yeah if youre really lonely it is its No tha that w that w that would be more promising PM Channel five PM And then it switches on ME Like you talk to it ME Can I have channel five ID Yeah UI It its just a remote that talks to you UI Uh ME Oh then forget about it ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Oh right okay UI I mean to certain cues ID Yeah PM Okay so Ill go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose PM So for the energy source do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option UI Kay UI Yeah Im fine with the basic battery ID Basic battery ME Mm ID Its cheap its cheerful its worked does work UI Hmm PM Are you happy with that ME Mm ME Yeah PM Okay PM So well go for the battery PM Then the case do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ID We were go we were going with the late with the the RSI rubber werent we UI Yeah so we want it rub rubber double curved ID The the The double whopper please ME So it will look like something like this PM Double PM Okay so then if we use double curved case then we have to u choose rubber pushbuttons and thats fine ID Yep but were going for the simple buttons UI So rubber rubber keys yeah ID Yeah ID And its cheapest all round it sounds kinda funky and we can also market it as i cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R people were getting the complaining about RSI and this is antiRSI PM P Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah ID So thats another marketing point that we can use ME Well the rubber pushbuttons ME Dont you have to move your Mm ID But anything is gonna have buttons ID Even if its a jog wheel its still repetitive PM I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they dont ID You You see you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen ID Its the v its the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement PM Mm ID Its not actually what you are doing ID But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these antiRSI ps specific Yeah ME Mm ME Yeah the rubbers good UI Yeah UI Were giving them a way to burn off steam basically yeah ME Yeah so they can sit there and go like Mm UI Not that watching TV should be that stressful ID And you know yeah you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah UI Oh yeah I guess TV can be stressful yeah if youre watching sports PM Alright thats me done UI Alright ID Okay Gabriel ID Lets um lets lets hear from you about the um its the interface UI Alright UI Yeah some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about ID Great PM Sorry UI Okay so Im continuing with the user interface uh topic UI And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division UI It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them UI Uh I also took uh Reissas marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um cause I think thats thats crucial as far as uh what keys were going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how theyre laid out ID Mm UI Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products uh like the coffee machine UI So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface UI I guess we we basically vetoed that idea UI Its its pointless ID Mm UI Uh its just a sample sensor sample output UI It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the TV UI Uh so yeah they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an MP three player like iPod ID Mm UI Um so weve already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI I mean you got that thumb movement that youre constantly doing ID Yeah ME Mm ME That does get annoying UI Um the other suggestion and I I have a feeling that were interested in in something more general but they suggested uh you know going i a little bit into a a niche like either gearing our remote towards kids where you could have lot of colours um the keys might be you know funny or or or uh something for the elderly where the remotes very large and the buttons are very large and theres only a few buttons ID Mmhmm UI But you know we can we can discuss this but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general but done well UI Uh um So the key layout and design are really crucial ID Yeah UI You dont want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um UI And I didnt mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department UI So this would be an example of bad layout where you have volume up and volume down but they have a V on both of them so uh its sort of confusing for the user ID Yeah ID Yeah UI Uh this is the example of the giant remote thats impossible to lose ID Do we have an uh example of a good one ME Uhhuh ID Brilliant ME Well Maybe we can Right UI And for something for kids UI Yeah UI Um ID Yeah UI And so yeah I th I think my personal preferences of weve all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um UI Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense UI I think it should be more general ID Mmhmm UI I didnt I didnt think the spinningwheel or the uh LC display were were crucial for us UI And yeah thats it for me ID Okay ID Well lets um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ID The um The the um the interface type were going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons UI So were were not gonna have any sort of display I think uh UI So yeah its just gonna be just gonna be pushbuttons UI Um UI I think we shall have a limited number of buttons ideally I mean a a power channel up channel down volume up volume down and a numerical keypad ID Yeah ID Yeah UI Uh UI And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that ID Yeah UI I guess its to the point where we need to decide about that ID Okay and were not yeah UI Well now that weve decided on our Um it seems like we wouldnt wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy but um Yeah I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere like maybe the RR can be yellow or something like that ID Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w were gonna s supplement it with anything you know colours or particular gimmicky bits to it were not were just gonna go for something Were Yeah ID Yeah ID Okay ID Okeydokey ID Yeah I dont have any other questions on this ID Lets move over to Yeah sure UI I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before UI I mean cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button UI But I think that should be I mean um I can speak with the button department but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating ID Yeah the button that just does that yeah UI So that should be simple ID Cool ME Well Im just basically letting you know whats happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year ID Mm yeah ME Um ME So yes so from looking at this years trends and fashions and also recent investigation that weve done in the remote control market we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which weve already probably discussed ID Mmhmm ME Um the most important aspect is look and feel ME So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have ME So it has to be Yep ID Yeah why should people buy this when theyre already got a remote that came with the TV ME Exactly UI Mm UI Yeah ME Um second uh it should be technologically innovative innovative ME So Technologically it should be like um work basically I guess ID Whats that mean ME It should work UI Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense I mean have something thats little more technologically advanced than whats on the market ME Should Thats new ID Okay now the trouble is is weve already decided that were going with the stuff that works already thats cheap ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Actually I mean these first two points weve already sort of gone away from cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean its different but I wouldnt say like a rubber remote is fancy ME Yeah ME Mm ID Yeah UI If thats what people want then we maybe were going in the wrong direction UI And its its not technologically innovative either ME So no loose Thats why I was thinking Bluetooth cause if you like put up Bluetooth and its like a Bluetooth remote control everybodys gonna like oh cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays like it really is like people and um when it comes to marketing like thats what people go for they dont really care whether you know at the end of the day whether it works properly or not ID Maybe we could um Of course they do UI Mm ME Well they do but its like its not Yeah but it looks good ID One hundred per cent thats your first thing you go oh Im not gonna buy that cause I dunno if it works or not ME If it looks good and its it can just be there for decoration ID Okay well what do you two think about this UI So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ME But like You could always insert yeah ID Yeah what I dont understand what m Yeah and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television UI Yeah thats basically what it allows you to do right ME Yeah but I mean people like Well if youre looking at if you looking at something thats going to be bought by people you have to make it new you have to make it state of the art ID It would that would mean youd need a television that has Bluetooth in it which no no television does does it PM Well Bluetooth would for example enable you I think to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone but your mobile phone is downstairs or something you would get on your television youre being called by this person right now ID That would mean wed have to make a television as well PM Things like that ID No that would be your telephone in with your television UI Yeah the that wouldnt be the remote so much I mean Mm PM No i No but if you get Bluetooth on the remote youd be able to I with the television yeah ID Yeah and i Nah the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible basically PM I was just trying to find an advantage PM Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then ME Well it doesnt Like it doesnt have to be you know Bluetooth that was just an idea but like it needs do something that you know is new ID An and there is no there is no such thing ME Whether its a battery it could be something really really minor you know like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there and peopleve already seen it peopleve already got it ID Okay ME If we want something new we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative PM Its been done for watches but I havent seen that for remotes yet ID Okay ID Yeah this thats thats very good ME And then you can market it ME Never have to change a battery again PM Change the batteries ever again ID And and this is all tying in very nicely ID The fact that its made out of this rubber we can throw it about ID Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about because it charges itself up by doing it PM Yeah well and in little characters you say yeah but not too much UI Yes so can Yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator ME I think safety s Yeah ID But yeah by the squeezing it the Yeah thats a great idea ID Well done ME Third most important aspect uh is its easy to use ME And I think weve all um worked that out UI were all about that ME Um okay in the fashion how its supposed to look ME Next years fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths shoes and furniture ME So next year people will be buying I found this really funny you know strawberry shaped chairs and things UI Okay so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them ID Yeah ME Yeah ME Rubber things ID I wanna watch the pineapple channel ME Um and as its rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy so its its not quite spongy but spongy I would say is yeah so were in ID Well spongy thats where ID Yeah were were ahead of the game there UI Yeah thats great for us ME Yeah ME And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel while still keeping to the companys image basically ME So yeah ID Okay ME I had to say So were moving in the right direction like Mm UI Right ID Alright yeah no this i this is good so through all that weve we go were right were gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing thats great using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that antiRSI you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself you are charging the batteries and um Im not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though UI Yeah UI Yeah thats great PM Yep UI Yeah I dont know how we incorporate We dont have to follow every trend I guess PM No vegetables ME Maybe make it like fruity colours or something ME Some sort UI Uhhuh ME Or Mm UI The power button could be like a big apple or something PM Well yeah but Apple would sue you for that ID Yeah this is true UI They don they dont own all images of apples PM sued the Beatles so Yeah UI Okay well make it a uh pomegranate a big pomegranate ID Well okay it seems like the only thing that we havent really finally um agreed on is its image ID Like yeah were were saying no we dont want it to be fruit and vegetables but we dunno what it should be or like are we going yeah it looks slick but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ME Well I think if its rubber it needs to be different ID I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky ME I think its it should be I mean what do you associate with rubber ME You know like really different colours basically ID L keep it clean keep it clean ME Okay sor I sorry I used the wrong word what do you associate with the mate the material that material ME Um Um like Im just thinking bright colours UI Yeah ME Bright natural colours nothing too Bright but too not yeah ID Bright but not too bright UI Yeah ME Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink ME Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah ID Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that do you mean UI Mm ME And on the back of it have the logo ID Okay what UI Sure PM Why not ID Okay UI The one thing Im wondering about I hope that were not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store theyre gonna see like three or four normal remotes and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote ID Tha Yeah I mean we thats we we Yeah ID This is the remote control tomato UI I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ME Well I can say in this country youll get you know lots of people wanting something really funky and cool ME Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying Mummy I wanna buy that one ME And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well because its um like kids wont break it its not breakable if you throw it around ID Yeah ME Especially with younger kids you know they can pick it up and and Yeah ME The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it but Yeah ID Well its its gotta be chew proof ME So so its rea its quite its quite like um user friendly and also for different families like like family use as well so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it I think PM Im gonna write that down ME Especially maybe younger girls if its in pink theyll be like pink remote control for their room something ID So what are you saying maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range the blue range the green range the Mm ME Yeah PM Thats yeah UI Mm ME So like you walk in youre like oh I like that remote control because its so bright and then and then the shop assistant comes up and says oh what colour would you like ME and then they go like oh I can choose the colour wow ME So it puts I think even the customer into more control over what theyre buying instead of youve got all colour its either that or nothing ME So they also get to pick ME Well personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour UI Yeah I mean that that seems to work well with for products like iPod where you know you have a variety of colours that people feel like theyre customising it when they buy it even you know just just by the fact of choosing ME Its um Yeah ME Mm ME D youve got the Evaluation PM Although Id be curious to see how many uh You know there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose and I would be curious how many people choose that colour UI Right ID Well thats that can be down to bit of market researching you know if thats easy enough to find out what colours are more popular PM Mm UI Yeah PM And produce less of the silly colours maybe ID Mm ID Okay ID Alright ID Well um well alright lets what were gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know youre gonna be working on the the look and feel design PM Yep ID Um Gabriel youre gonna be working on you know come up with the the user interface design ID Then basically you two are gonna be working together on this ID You wont be going off to your separate offices PM Alright UI Okay ID Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay UI Oh right ID I think yeah its gonna you know come up ki you know be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas PM Mm ID Cause at the moment uh you know its its hard PM Cool UI Yeah ID We were kinda going yeah its gotta feel nice its gotta look cool and that its you know now we can actually start you know s some sort of physical something or other PM It is UI That sounds good ID Um and youre gonna be working on the product evaluation ID Um ID And I will be uh talking to the bosses basically and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh thats it really PM Great ID Keeping things t well uh you know ho hopefully uh keeping things together ID Um ID Yeah thats This is this is uh good ID So we know for definite we know weve weve now got some definite things going on ID We definitely know how its powered we definitely know that um its gonna be a simple buttons were not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things so weve were keeping the costs down UI Mm ID Its this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky ID Dont know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff ME Mm ID People you know people are saying oh standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite Its supposed to fix it rather than cause it ME Yeah ID Um ID you know were gonna we were gonna as a sort of extra something on it you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ID Well look into this lock key facility although whether or not it happens or is possible I dont know but something to look into UI Right ID Okay ID I think thats um well done everybody UI Alright ID Anyone have any uh any questions everyone know what theyre doing UI Yeah ID Cause if you dont youll Im sure youll soon get an email about it UI Yeah UI Mm I think we all know what we need to do now ME S This gives you all the details ID Okay UI Okay ID right well ID Its um were weve still couple of minutes until our meetings due to finish ID But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire UI Okay Ill stay in here ME um ID Um UI Does the payraise immediately come into effect on our next paycheck or is that So were buying fut I mean were getting futures in the company ID Um I think its uh yeah I think its gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product ID Yeah I think i I think thats I think thats the way its gonna happen at the moment UI So we really have a incentive to make this remote work ID Yeah ID Yeah UI Id like to share in the coffee machine profits because thats really doing well ID I want a share in the space rocket ID Did you see that this k that this company weve made a spaceship UI Yeah ME Yeah UI This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots ID Yeah ME Mm ID Yeah UI Yeah were definitely not in the money making department UI Well I I did notice looking at I mean they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the RR brand and and to be immediately noticeable ID Yeah UI I mean if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page its not obvious ME Mm UI RR UI Well it is to us because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine but its doesnt have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously its just sil silver and black ID Mm PM Thats true ID And the spaceship doesnt have the R have a massive R and R down the side of it but I still want one UI No UI Mm PM Doesnt Yeah ID Okay ID Um Ive just had a sign flashing up saying finish the meeting ID Uh UI Okay ID Yeah UI Right well I guess thats us ID Yeah ID Its not telling its not saying do anything in particular just yet ID So maybe you should go back to your own offices UI Okay UI Right PM Are we taking these off ID Yeah,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries. The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product. The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote."
ME Its PlayDoh ID PlayDohs edible ID Did you know that ID Its definitely Yeah ME Because kids yeah PM I used to eat it UI Ive Ive definitely eaten it before UI I didnt know was edible ME But um its its made edible cause yeah ID Its its chew proof ME Its made edible cause kids eat it and if its wasnt edible then Well normal babies ID Yeah UI Actually that makes sense because I remember like peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other peoples Moms making like homemade PlayDoh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough ID Yeah ME Oh yeah it is yeah ME Oh yeah UI Mmhmm ID Right ID Everybody everybody ready UI Yeah PM Yep ID Okay lets have your um lets get have the uh presentation UI Weve got some PM Weve got a cool prototype UI Yeah its pretty exciting UI So everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy to use yeah double curved um but also something that was gonna jump out at people something that would be different uh separate it from the other remotes out on the market PM Double curved ID Nice UI So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand youll see what a nice thing we have going here ME That is cool UI So basically if you hold it like that the one on your thumb yeah the thumb button is the power button ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Your index finger is channel up middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up your pinkie is volume down ME Whats the big blue thing UI Thats the lock button has a L L on it and then the M is a mute button ME Oh cool UI And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also theres a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want ID what button ID Um ME And mute ID Oh mute ID Okay UI So its really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available but we think its very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different ID That certainly does UI So all the I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them ID Mm UI So you dont you Yeah PM Which is ant antiRSI ID Mm UI It should be UI And its also conformable to the size of your hand UI I mean if thats too big its a rubber remote so you can you know change that ID Yeah ID S great ME Oh its so cute UI So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah thats good thinking yeah ID I have one thing about it but its a small thing but itd mean wed have to make a righthanded one and a lefthanded one PM Oh right yeah ID But thats I dont see why thats not possible UI Yeah if we build rocket ships why cant we build lefthanded and righthanded uh remotes ID Yeah ID They make lefthanded scissors you know ME Yeah but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if theres lefthanders and righthanders in the family what they have two remotes UI Yeah I didnt I didnt think about that but Id yeah ID Yes s Mm PM Yeah I know I know people who have lefthanded and righthanded people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse and everybody is using righthanded mouse ID Sure ID Sure ME Yeah Im sure theyll be able to I mean its only pressing buttons you dont have to do anything you know extraordinary UI Uhhuh ME I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah its not Yeah UI Yeah PM Imagine d are you right handed ID Yeah PM Imagine youre doing it with your left hand I dont think its too But we can have both uh Yeah ME Have them in stock ID Yeah ME Make em more appealing as well ID But um other than that I mean uh and thats um you know thats just something I think I think its great yeah great idea UI Do you think it says RR PM I think it does ID I think its well if the RR motto is we bring fashion to to electronics Id say that could be quite fashionable UI Fashion to electronics UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah UI And its got the b the black and yellow and blue UI Plus red which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh ID Yeah PM There you go ID Yeah UI So thats thats our end of things wha uh Thats Yeah ID Yeah very good yeah ID Its come up with what weve you know the things thats what weve what we were looking at doing hasnt it all seems to be there ID Well done ME And all the playing around is uh Yeah Im just do you wanna plug in ID Um before we move on I need that cable ME Okay ID Thank you ID Yeah ID Um ID One thing I do need to do we need to look at is the costs UI The costs was that what you said PM PlayDoh is very cheap ID Well yeah ME Mm ME PlayDoh wont last very long everybodyll go like oops its gone ID um Yeah UI But its edible ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm PM Chew proof ME Well theyll buy more of them if you eat them UI That was the main criteria from the last meeting it had to be chew proof ID Uh right ID Okay now I think well do this I could do you know I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you but its just easy enough to go through it with you so were going for the kinetic power ME Yeah PM Oh hoho PM Yep ID And the electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest thing thats inside it ID Ooh ID So the case weve gone for the double curved ID Um and its made out of rubber ID The interface is pushbuttons ID And button supplements well theyre in diff special colours arent they ME Yeah ID So special colours UI Yeah ME Its better for And special material ID Special form yeah theyre a special form there in shapes and stuff UI Yeah I mean these these ones on the side are curved kind of so The buttons are rubber ID Yep ID Yeah ID Um ID Are they made out of any special material PM Rubber ID No theyre not ID Theyre not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything theyre just simple Okay ME Well theyre rubber arent they PM Yeah ID Right ID So lets see if that comes within budget ID And it does ID That is gonna cost uh Yeah ME Were under budget ID Thats gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make ID And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty UI Thats cool UI Yeah UI Yeah ID So this is all very very good UI And were actua actually making a better profit than we expected ID The bosses will be very pleased ID Okay lets just save this so I can email it to you ID Uh ID Save it in save it in the uh my documents ME Its already saved I think ID Splendid ID Okay ID So uh thats done with this with this um doodah so youre ID Gonna do what you were gonna do your evaluation ME Thank you ME Mm ME Oh yeah ME This is where we all get to I get to write on the oops on the board ME Right ME Oh ME S function Okay ID F eight ID I love the smell of that PlayDoh ME Mm UI Yeah have some have some ID I cou ME Okay ME So evaluation ME Were gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria ME Ive got the criterias ME And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true so its its more like its fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesnt fit the criteria ME And the criterias are and Ill draw this up on the board so we have a box ME And this is false this is just like to keep you informed ME So sevens here and ones here and then youve got in the middle ME So the first criteria ME Do you all get what were doing UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME Okay cool ME Okay first criteria look and feel ME So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ME As it is it colourwise and is it spongy ME So what mark should we give for that UI Mm ID I would give it a seven UI Yeah ME As in its not UI Oh sorry one ID Oh sorry one d yeah PM A one ME A one a one ME So Ill just write criteria criteria one we get one ME Second criteria new technology ME Have we implemented new technology ME As in the new hightech So its PM Well the kinetic thing yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah UI That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new ME So well give it a Yeah PM Well so the um Yeah UI Its ergonomic but thats not thats thats a design thats a des thats a design thing yeah ID Yeah but thats not a technological thing thats another thing i thats another marketing thing PM Yeah PM Yeah PM True ID So on the technical side of it it Easy to use ME Id say its about a a twoish UI Its about in the mid in the middle somewhere maybe yeah I dunno PM Two ME Two ME Three PM Yeah UI Maybe three yeah ME three ME So criteria three is is it easy to use ME I think its a one I think ID Id say its I wouldnt not if youre lefthanded its not UI Yeah ID I would give it a I would give it a two cause i i it i it i it is more geared for righthanded people than lefthanded people but Yeah UI Mm ME Two so its But if we make a righthanded and a lefthanded then UI Okay PM Mm UI If were gonna have one lefthanded and one righthanded then I would give it a one but otherwise otherwise a two ME Yeah PM Yeah ID Give it a t give it a two ME Yeah okay ME Kay criteria four is costs ID Cost ID Its come in under budget ME s great UI Yeah ID So thats a definite one UI That was great ME Yeah ID Amount of buttons ME Like the amount of buttons cause people like a lot le like So its a one ID Contains only the necessary buttons ID Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Um criteria six ME RSI is it good against ME Yes PM Yes s yeah ID So its antiRSI ME Very good ME Its one ME And criteria seven which is the last one does it get lost ME Is it easy to get lost PM Its yellow ID I dont think its gonna get lost easily UI It is very bright yeah ME No ME But it is smallish UI Its not the kinda thing thats gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something you know PM Two UI Maybe it will UI Uh PM T Mm ME Mm ME I think i it would could be could get lost UI You think it could lost Mm ME Mm ID two ME Yeah ME I mean its not fully its not fully like you cant say I mean its not a one definitely ID I mean it No I mean I mean you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically but Okay UI Okay UI Yeah anything I mean UI Okay UI Its bigger than the average mobile I guess ME Yeah UI But yeah it can get lost ME The mobiles get lost all the time UI Yeah UI Okay yeah two is fine ME But then you ring em and you find them UI Yeah yeah PM Mm ME So Yeah ME So thats that ME So thats the evaluation so Id say Yay ID Alright its all all systems go ME Its like like a number one PM Weve weve done well UI Yeah ME Um ME Number one product UI Mm ME All done thanks ID We cant fail ME We fitted all the criterias ME Yeah ME Yeah so So thats that one ID Well done Reissa ID Okay I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know little bit of praise for everybody here for how theyve worked on it you know both individually and as a team ID You know youve w everyones come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments um and then come together and worked in you know integrally you know at the right times psp you know especially you two ID Thats all you know gone very very well and and and be you know has been good communication going on UI Yeah UI Yeah during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team ID Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about PM Well PM You know It is ID Fantastic UI Think were the were the envy of all the of all the other RR teams ME been cool ID I think So I I you know and I think weve co we have come weve come up with something new something that hasnt been done before we havent were not just rehashing an old design ME In four diff in in four meetings ID Yeah ME Funny all designer meetings could be this quick ID You know maybe this isnt a simulation maybe this is actually so its like Sony or someone like that theyre theyre just yeah they get Yeah UI Yeah I think theyre actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote ME Theyre using our ideas ID Yeah two years time this will be on the market ID Ex exactly that product um thum well go yeah we designed that and noone will believe us ID But um No I think when this meetings finished like officially there b well get a uh questionnaire to fill in UI So at this stage I mean is this the last meeting of the project UI We dont uh have another one after its gone gone to marke market or something ME Yeah PM Y Oh really ID Or six uh I havent got message ME Just start summarising now ME You can reply to the same message ME See summary there ME If you just reply to that one UI So theres no way to like predict what our Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals we had a specific number for profits that we wanted UI It was fifty mil fifty million I dont remember ME Was it was it fifty or five UI But theres not a way to compute that I mean since we saved on the on the production cost do we know how much were making on profit ID It gets handed over to another department ME Depends how much we sell UI Uh ID What our what our project was was to come up with the product basically UI Hmm ID the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget ID When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and you know the b the profits and all that thats other departments its another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah the all the guys in the profit sharing yeah UI But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing ID Um ID Yeah thats it ID You know weve weve weve made i weve made weve designed the product weve ma weve got the prototype its within budget its does everything that we wanted it to do ME We finished an hour earlier ID Its new its its um something that uh that isnt out there already UI I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh you know after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote you know ME Mm UI Were not were not you know tying tying our cart to that one horse ME Mm ID Yeah ID Well this is very marketable in that it is its its something thats kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that its that its um hang on I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my emails that I sent off ME Definitely ID Um that you know its marketable in the sense that its whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury our one does the complete opposite you know so thats something thats new which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new UI Mm UI Mm UI Mm UI It make watching TV healthy ID Yeah and if youre not having a good time with the TV you can f throw it about you know ME Yeah ID Its fine its kid proof ME Just dont sh dont throw it at any of the ornaments and break them UI Uh ID Well you can break the ornaments but you wont break that ME No ID Yeah ID So all in all I think weve done very well PM Mm yep ID Well done everybody ME Yay UI Right you too ID Um ID Drinks are on the company PM Cool ID In the corporate bar thats next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that were thatve all just gained access to UI Mm PM Glad to hear that ID Yeah ID Thats it UI Thats it ID Well as far as I t as far as I know ID Um ME Yep ME We havent got the five minute left thing yet ID No ID Anyone wanna play I spy ME Mm mm UI I guess its probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence UI Should we call the day then ID Yeah I guess ID I mean were gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire UI Uh right ID Um ID Its probably gonna be the same as one weve done before UI Mmhmm ME In project ID But Im not the authority to say that it is ID Um how does everyone feel about the technology thats been used in this ID The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ME I love it ME I love it ME I think its cool ME Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and its cool ME Being watched ME Um Wow UI Your moment to shine ID Yeah ID I thi you know Id Id n yeah as we said earlier Ive not never seen that before ID something that t the whiteboard thingy thats great PM Yeah ID Um but a p a pen with a camera on it I dont think its such a new thing ID I mean its i or in such a new idea ID It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff but as its not its literally thatll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text PM Yeah ME Mm UI Right I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that its just the first step ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Mm ME Logitech UI I guess we should end this since were off off topic ME Yeah UI So UI Shall we Right ME Meeting adjourned ID Yeah,"The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we
re happy with their product and their performance in the project."
ME Hmm ID Okay ID Good morning everybody ID Um Im glad you could all come ID Im really excited to start this team ID Um Im just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us for our kickoff meeting ID My name is Rose Lindgren ID I Ill be the Project Manager ID Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then Im gonna talk a little bit about the project then well move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit including a tool training exercise ID And then well move into the project plan do a little discussion and close since we only have twenty five minutes ID First of all our project aim ID Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original trendy and userfriendly ID Im hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those ID Um so were gonna divide us up into three compa three parts ID First the functional design which will be uh first well do individual work come into a meeting the conceptional design individual work and a meeting and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting ID So that well each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating ID Okay were gonna get to know each other a little bit ID So um what were gonna do is start off with um lets start off with Amina ID Um Alima sorry Alima PM Alima ID Um were gonna do a little tool training so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you ID Um introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it PM Okay PM Um I dont know which one of these I have to bring with me ID Probably both PM Right so Im supposed to draw my favourite animal PM I have no drawing skills whatsoever PM But uh lets see introduce myself PM My name is Alima Bucciantini PM Um Im from the state of Maine in the US PM Im doing nationalism studies blah blah blah and I have no artistic talents ID How do you spell your name PM A L I M A ID Thanks PM Oh and I guess Im the Industrial Designer on this project PM So lets see if I can get um here PM I will draw a little turtle for you all PM Not necessarily cause its my absolute favourite animal but just that I think theyre drawable PM And you have the pretty little shell going on PM Some little eyes PM Happy PM There you go PM Thats a turtle ME Yes ID So what are your favourite characteristics PM Um PM I I like the whole having a shell thing ID Mm PM Its quite cool carry your home around where you go um quite decorative little animals they can swim they can theyre very adaptable they carry everything they need with them um and theyre easy to draw ID Excellent ID Shall we just go around the table UI Uh Okay UI Well my name is Iain uh and Im the User Interface Designer for the project ID Mm UI Um UI And Ill try and draw my favourite animal UI Ill I should leave that one on there shouldnt I before I callously rub it off PM No you can erase the turtle its alright ID Might be nice to have them all up there at same time UI Um Im not gonna draw it quite to scale um UI Is that at least identifiable PM Snake ME Well UI Its a whale yes ID Em Mm kay PM Well snake PM Its w Oh a cat UI Thanks ME Oh my god its better than what Im gonna be able to do UI Um and yeah the reason I like whales is cause uh theyre well first of all theyre quite intelligent um and also theyre theyre kind of mysterious like we dont really know much about them or or understand how they work how they form groups UI And I just find them interesting animals ME Take my contraptions with me ME Alright Im Jessy ME Im from around DC ish sort of in the US ME And were gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on animal ME Dont really know how to draw this ME Just where can I Mm ME Mm ME Maybe if I do the water but how ME Sort of give an idea ME I have no idea how one would explain this ME Mm maybe with some whiskers ME Briefly its supposed to be a seal ME You can imagine it in the water ME I like them because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time ME Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that ID Mm kay ID Im Rose and Im Project Manager from California ID Um ID Hmm ID S Um its actually a coyote ME Its definitely significantly harder once you are doing it PM Yeah ID Lets see PM Right ID Lets see lets give it a little bit of a snout I dont know some teeth ME Thats impressive PM Thats Thats pretty impressive ID Yeah UI Cool ID Oh dear ID Yes ID I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California ID We have coyotes howl all the time ID So I really enjoy their their singing you theyre really beautiful animals ID Mm ID Okay um moving on to slightly more serious stuff ID Were gonna talk about project finances ID Um we have a couple wed like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television its a we have a market range of Internet like its an international market range we dont have to worry about specifics ID Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro ID So were selling it for twice what wed like to produce it for ID Okay um just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um I could Id like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you dont like etcetera so Hmm ME Um I hate when theres like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going I dont know ME Now they keep combining all different remotes together and I dont know if I necessarily like that cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload ME I just wanna watch the TV um ME Always gets lost ME Some sort of like device to help you find it UI Ive used Ive used remote controls for things like TV and the CD player and video recorder and I I guess theyre theyre pretty neat neat little tools uh UI You dont have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel ID Mm UI So especially if youre someone really lazy like me they theyre pretty nice UI Um UI I find them they can be a bit annoying especially like you know if Im watching TV I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me you know one for the TV one for the digital box one for m the video recorder as well UI Um UI And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing theyve got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off change the channel change the volume PM Yeah um PM I agree with having too many remotes around PM My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things and I dont know how to work half of them um PM Whats important for me I guess is that its easy to use and that theres not too many buttons they are not too small you know you know you need to n to know what youre doing PM And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infrared ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Um I think there is a way around that but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on so i its just simpler just to just turn around the TV itself and I think thats if were gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what its doing ID Mmhmm PM So I know ME What about like batteries and things like that like are there some remotes that don dont require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ID Um I would imagine all of them but we could but its possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double As PM Yeah something that doesnt Mm ME Mmhmm ID Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um MP three players now and that kind of thing ME Mmhmm ID Um ID Um ID Okay it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes ID So um like you said you dont like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yet you dont wanna have five remotes ID So how do we work with that UI Mm PM Yeah PM Could we get something that just has No doesnt have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that Im not very coherent about but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything you know volume control on off channel changing ID Mmhmm ME And maybe that spatially divides it so its like if youre looki if youre trying to get the TV on thats you know like the top thing on the remote I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how were gonna make it but if its like all the TV stuff was here then all the VCR stuff was here all the whatever else we have programmed into it its all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together cause then you like I dont even know what Im turning on PM Yeah ID Mm PM N that way Yeah ID Mm PM Yeah and if um if youd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldnt need to use every day ME Mmhmm ID Okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off channel changing volume and another rote remote with all the special things PM Um ID Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well PM Yeah PM Mm ID So like you have to have them somewhere cause youre gonna m need those special functions occasionally UI Yeah PM Right ID Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote UI Can I ask are we designing a remote control for a television only um and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ID Good question ID I dont know that yet UI Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it PM Mm ID Its a good question ID Um ME Mmhmm hmm ID Ill look into that ID If I can ME I think its just TV I mean if it if were taking it just new product a new television remote control thats not like doesnt say PM Mm yeah ME You know things might be more advanced than that ID Mm UI So we should maybe we should assume that i t its just a television that were wanting to control UI Well I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I dont know if that works technologically or not PM Yes PM I guess we have to define what what were aiming for PM If its just a television then that its a bit simpler cause theres less buttons that would even need to be on it UI Yeah ME Its an idea with the buttons being really PM Large ME Yeah PM If you have older people or people like me that arent very coordinated handeye its really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons if we can help it ID Mm UI Yeah ID Okay ID Kay sounds like weve had a good little discussion for our first ideas ID Mind if we move on ID Ps mm okay UI Kay ME Mmhmm ID Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes ID I believe weve actually been only working on this this one for about twenty so we can continue discussing more new ideas if youd like um but this is just a breakdown of what well be doing individually PM Hmm ID Um the industrial design Alima will be doing um the working design PM Yeah ID Um the User Interface Designer thats for ID Technical functions I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons ID Um user requirements um so youll be hearing about different trends uh about different things that people need um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that weve been having well get from the actual consum s consumers ME Mmhmm ID Mm kay um ID And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach ID I realised in this past one we we didnt have much we just wanted to get a little brainstorming done ID Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um ID Any questions UI What were gonna be discussing at the next meeting UI Do we know that ID I havent gotten an agenda yet um Ill put that together ID Im sure as well each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then well come back together UI Right UI Yep ID So Im sure well all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm kay um Ill type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you PM Kay UI Yep PM Im sure well be busy UI Okay ID Um just including all the things that we talked about UI Can you email your slides as well ID Um UI Is that possible ID Yes I yes I think I can ID Mmhmm UI Cool ID Ill just attach it to an email ID And youre youre number two three four PM Im two ME Im four ID Is that correct ID Okay PM Alright ID Excellent ID It was lovely meeting you all ID Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails PM Kay ID Let me see if I can do that right now,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced herself to the team. The project manager introduced the upcoming project in which the team is to create a remote control. The team members participated in a tool training exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal on the white-board and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager then talked about the project finances and discussed selling prices, profit aim, market range, and production costs. The project manager then led the team in a discussion on their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to include in the remote they are producing. The team members discussed the option of combining remotes and how to produce a remote which is capable of controlling multiple devices."
ID Good to see you all again ID Lets see if that comes up ID This is our functional design meeting ID Um ID Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up ID Et voila ID Okay ID Mm um we put the fashion in electronics ID Lets start ID Okay our agenda today um just check the time its twelve thirteen ID Um ID Im gonna do an opening talk about um did you all get the minutes ID I emailed them to you ID Im also putting em them in the shared folder UI Yep ID So um then I well talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations PM Right ID Um Ill talk about the new project requirements Ive just received and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions ID Finally well just close ID Were starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes ID So First of all the functional design objectives ID Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled the functions design what effects the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function ID Okay three presentations um you can go in any order you choose um ME Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ID Sure please do ME I dunno ME How do I hook my screen up PM I think you might have to disconnect Rose ID Yes I do ID Yeah UI Well theres a wee a wee plug just just that one there Ah thats it yep ME Where does it go ME Mmhmm ME Hmm Im not supposed to move this but Wheres function UI And then you have to press function F eight I think it is on your laptop ID Function F eight yeah ID The blue one FN ME No signal ID Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and Mm kay ME Ah wait s screw in PM Yeah PM I I think you just have to push it in really hard ME Push the screw UI Thats it PM Oh got it ME Mm alright Ive never attached to anything ID Its taking it a little bit Kay there you go PM Mm neither have I ME Alright so I dont know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if Im the only one who is PM Alright ME But I dont even know how to play this ME No ID Press the little presentation ID Its the um it looks like a Y kind of over there above Draw ID There that one there you go ME Alright ME So were just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked ME Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research ME They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch TV and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had ME What they found was they analysed peoples desires and needs ME Focusing on their desires um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote ME I dont know anything beyond what fancy means but thats particularly of use to us I think PM Hmm ME Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions ME Um people also had certain frustrations that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design PM Kay ME That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes ME I think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration ME People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that theres too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use PM Hmm ME It also mentioned something called RSI and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is because I dont know UI Repetitive strain injury ME What UI Repetitive strain injury ME Ah ME There we go ME Wow UI So if you Cheers ME People do not like that ME So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um the repetitive use I guess caused a strain ME Um looking at the needs people specified the problem right now is that peoples remotes are not matching their operating behaviour ME People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote ME And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume ME People also zap like to change the channel about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use ME So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings the screen settings and the channel settings because theyre used much more infrequently and probably just complicate whats going on ME So I think that some things that we might wanna think about the idea of an LCD screen was brought up although they didnt have any details on what peoples preferences on that were so I dunno know if thats coming to me later or something like that ME But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use make sure that you know something like an audio setting isnt given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing thats used a lot more often ME And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that its not ugly and that it feels like the way theyre gonna use it so it doesnt give them any hand injuries or things like that PM Hmm ID Thank you very much ID That was that was great PM Mm kay ID Um s move on to the next presentation um on effects ID Was that you ME Hmm ID Great ME Yeah have I unscrewed it ID Push ID User interface right ID Interface ME Here we go ME Mmhmm ME And I think thats in the shared if I did it right if anyone wants to look at it ID Mm kay thank you PM Okay great ID Okay UI Here we go UI Right so Im gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um UI We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is UI Its a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television so i its basically a communication device UI We we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television saying change the channel change the volume uh yeah adjust these settings adjust the brightness UI Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control UI First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications UI We need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does uh how it works and what the enduser is gonna want from this product UI Um UI Oh a way Id suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work uh sorta find out what people think of em UI Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience UI Um and different different people sort of prefer different things ID Hmm UI Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment UI When a users using a remote control he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places UI So in some sense were gonna were gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that were not completely shocking people UI But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something thats thats perhaps a little bit different something that stands out UI Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities UI Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is UI The second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and price UI So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product ID Hmm UI So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls UI In analysing these we can consider what what things whats good about them uh what things do they get right whats bad about them whats wrong with em um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls UI Heres two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum UI Um on the left here weve got uh an engineeringbased design for a remote control so its one thats got lots of buttons its its fully featured everything you might possibly want to do is there you know its got forward backwards up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame UI Yeah its its fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once youve learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your TV UI The one on the right is a lot more basic UI Its just got the essential functions of the TV changing the channel play stop volume UI It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but again th its its swings and roundabouts UI There are disadvantages you cant use it say to to freeze the television picture UI Uh theres a lot of features that are missing from that remote control UI So weve got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two UI Um as I said before remote controls are subjective different people want want different things UI Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device thats simple it its easy to use uh its got big buttons for doing the things I do most often changing the volume changing the channel UI It it does everything that I need it to uh as I said before Im quite lazy I dont wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television UI I also want something that that looks cool um and that that feels good thats ergonomically designed ID Mm kay ID Thank you very much ID That was very useful ID Its funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes PM Hmm ID Um ID And neither of them were very pretty you know ME No PM Yeah PM I think that could be our selling point ID Mm ME A fashion fashion remote UI I think theres theres certainly a market for technology that looks cool PM Right ID Mm ME Mmhmm UI And I think thats thats why companies like Appleve ve ve made a lot of progress PM Hmm ME Yeah PM Right I really cant see what Im doing so does anyone have a Ahha look at that showing up already ID You there it is ID Lovely ME So wait did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see UI Uh that was just on the d on the company web site yeah ME Okay ME Cause I was like googling and then Im like wait it wont let me google ID Hmm PM Yeah PM Alright um No how do I play again ID Um the its right above Draw ID There are three thingy if its way at the bottom PM Ah ID Under three icons and its the one that looks like a desk ID Yeah that one ID There are Ys PM Okay PM So this is our working design presentation PM Um I had a bit of some issues with this because I wasnt able to find everything I needed but I guess thats were still in early stages PM Um so yeah this is this PM Though th the thing about working design is the what were trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function PM Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder PM It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out and then you get coffee at the end thats nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work PM Dont know if Im explaining that very well but how do I get to the next s ah PM So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done PM So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen PM So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function PM And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately PM So um Uh ID You just press yeah just click PM Uh ID Thatll be fine PM So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that cause you dont need a sight line PM So thats one thing were gonna work on PM Um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data which then goes through the infrared so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing is gonna be crucial PM And really it all comes down to the to the user because theyre the one thats controlling most of the working design PM So the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever thats gonna m make it work then the chip which converts the data the user thats controlling the chip and the infrared bulb thats gonna let us move the data to the receiver PM So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this PM You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip which is also controlled by the users PM You have energy going to the user whos controlling the chip ooh s not what I wanted to do uh uh ID Um yeah use that thing you can go back previous PM Previous PM Sorry about that guys ID Pardon PM Oh ID Oh well PM No no no no no ID Okay PM Okay lets just get back to my schematic here ID Ye Double click on it ID With the right with the left hand one PM W yeah yeah PM I think its frozen PM Here PM Dont show me that tip again ID There we are PM There we are PM Sorry about this guys PM Im kind of pathetic with things like this PM Um alright PM So you have your energy source your user interface whos controlling the chip the chip also uses the energy and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infrared bulb which will then bring the data to the receiver PM So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way PM This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out ID Mmhmm PM And personal preferences besides the fact that I cant spell we need a longlasting energy source people dont wanna be changing it a lot PM We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isnt too complicated PM We need a straightforward interface like Ian was saying simple not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so that youre not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands ID Mmhmm PM So thats pretty much it for the working design ID Excellent ID So um PM Rose do you think you can give me a hand with this ID Yes absolutely ID Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things PM Yeah ID Lefty loosey righty tighty right PM Yeah UI Whats up UI Lefty loosey ID Lefty loosey righty tighty UI Uh UI Never heard that before thats good ID Oh yes UI Ill think of that every time now PM Its gonna stick in your head ME Yeah thats a good one itll stick with you ID Mm kay ID Um I have nothing on my screen ID Just a sec PM Mm ID Here we are PM Ooh no signal ID Okay yeah its fine ID Okay requirements ID We have a couple new requirements that I was just emailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as were creating this PM Okay ID We didnt bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far but were not gonna work with teletext because um well it thats been taken over by the internet so were not gonna worry about um were not gonna worry about that ME Whats teletext ID Um PM Uh its a British thing ME Oh UI You dont have it in the States ME Oh so Mmhmm PM No ID It no ID W d could would you care to explain it UI Oh I didnt realise UI Um yeah its like a I suppose its kind of similar to a very very basic web browser UI Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control uh y and you type in the page number you want so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it UI And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information mostly rather boring stuff like whats on TV next and share prices and that kind of thing PM S Lottery numbers and sport scores UI Yep news headlines PM But if you ever see the TV saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now thats what theyre talking about ID How ME Oh UI Its earl its pretty old technology UI Its like nineteen eighties ID Okay ME That explains a lot PM I have no idea why we dont have it but Kay ME Thats good ID Interesting ID Okay um well were not gonna the management has decided were not gonna work with that ID Um Okay um and were also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television video or etcetera ID Just for television ID Thats what were focused on UI Right ID Um otherwise becomes to complex we wanna get this out um very quickly ID We only have a a short amount of time ID Um and finally theres more marketing I think um our corporate image has to be recognisable ID So while were gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design PM Mm UI So whats our corporate image like UI Its Its kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics ID Looks like yeah kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the Rs in um mmhmm UI Its like double R UI Yeah ID But its yeah we put the um fashion in electronics ID So we gotta keep that in that in mind PM Okay so we want something that looks good and is yellow ID Yep ID Yep ID Yeah or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow PM Okay ID Like we can we can play around with it a little bit ID Um ID Okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group ID We need to decide who our target group is ID You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences for example that um that older people didnt really care for um voice recognition but younger people did ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Um and so who are we aiming this at PM Well if were gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically I think a sort of younger group that thats whos gonna be attracted to this ME Yes I do think whos gonna have the money to buy that also that one ID Mmhmm ID Its gonna be twenty five Euro remember so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is PM Mmhmm UI Is it is it something thats gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television UI Cause that would affect the way that we market it ID Well at least right now what were doing is um deciding on just the remote itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five Euro by itself UI Right UI Right okay ME The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically theres a big jump after thirty five people dont really care if it has voice so its like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that thats a good idea PM Mmhmm ME I dunno Im gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later but if thats sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range PM Yeah thats probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so that might be a fairly good target group for us UI Yeah ID Now those are thats all specific for speech recognition ID Are we gonna use that as one of our functions UI Um PM Mm UI I I would say no because its gonna add too much to the price UI Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying uh well uh weve got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ID Mmhmm ID Mm PM To produce it yeah ID To produce it yes UI And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises ID Mm ME But what else are we gonna put I mean not that Im really gungho about it I dont know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though ME So like other than just making it look good how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same upndown buttons and whys anyone gonna buy a new remote UI Yeah PM Hmm PM But right PM Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement PM Everything were talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesnt necessarily mean more technology in fact it could use it could mean not ME Mmhmm ID Thats a good thing to keep in mind PM If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology ME If someones looking to buy a new remote dont they want like an upgrade ME I dunno ID Upgrade ID Well we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um userfriendly PM Yeah simplification UI Yeah ID Simplification so Uhhuh mm ME Mmhmm PM They could have a crap remote that came with their TV thats just impossible to use or maybe it broke or maybe theyre just missing it ME Mmhmm ID And we also need to talk about if were only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or Kind of pull out of the side PM Hmm ME Can you like I mean this may be too complicated but I wish I had something to explain it like if it was just a simple either this way or this way that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out kind of and like you got the rest the buttons but the rest of them like went in UI Yeah PM Ooh UI The remote There are remote controls like that yeah ME Do you know what Im saying UI Like some TVs they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons ID Mm PM Ooh UI So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or retune it then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and theres all the all the special buttons ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Cause then s like people who dont wanna ever look at them never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just dont even read it then youll never even know that those things can pull out PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Mmhmm ME And youre a happy person and everyone else doesnt have to have like two remotes one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones but s all still in one PM Yeah thats a good idea UI Yeah ID Mmhmm UI I think thats a good idea yeah PM Mm ID Um we have to be careful that that that doesnt impede um the chip transmitting information but um thats gonna be mostly technological thing ME Yeah PM Good point UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Um ID Okay um so what are we emphasising ID I what in this project UI Si simplicity and fashion ME I think simplicity fashion ID Simplicity and fashion PM Yeah mm ID Okay those are very good goals I think um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do ID Simplicity and fashion and yeah or usability speci however you wanna say that which includes um an emphasis on making the infrared very functional so that you dont have to travel around a lot ME Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Yeah ME What can you do to like make the infrared more functional like why would it not be ID Um ME Im just wondering ID I think its a lot to do with battery but thats just my Mmhmm ME Okay PM The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering ME So s just the quality of the chip PM Yeah PM I think so ME Okay PM The quality uh quality of all the components really I mean we cant really do anything shoddy work cause its gonna be visible down the line UI Yeah ID So our target group were saying fifteen to thirty five ME Well I dunno how useful that number is if were not doing Yeah ID S voice recognition which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control like it might be necessary for a TV but not for the remote c you know ME Yeah ME I dont UI Its yeah its pretty its pretty hightech PM Mmmm ID Seems a little bit Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Yeah and it might be too expensive ME And if the whole idea is youre using a remote then why would you have voice like you know what I mean and then its like you wouldnt need a remote youd just talk to your TV ID Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Its for like the ultimately lazy people who cant even be bothered to pick up the remote PM Ooh PM Yeah ME Mm yeah ME Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers Ill email you before the next meeting in terms of ages PM I Mmhmm ME But this doesnt divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also which isnt I mean really isnt that representative especially if its a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means theres very few in each age group so Twenty to like fifty five ID Mmhmm PM Yeah but I th I think regardless were were aiming for the under sixty five or something ID Under sixty five okay thats a good start UI Yep ID Um ID Id say were uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ID Cause that would go up to like fifty PM Or like single professionals or something ID Okay single Its its hard to narrow it down PM Yeah ME I dunno PM Its really hard to figure out right now UI I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages ID Mmhmm UI I mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so its going to appeal to people maybe people who have problems with technology you know people who get scared by having lots of buttons and that might be older people but then weve also got fashion which is something that definitely appeals to younger people ID Okay ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Well maybe we dont have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that like well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing ID Right UI Yeah UI Yeah aim for a an income group PM Thats a good point ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Mm ID So maybe its more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because yeah things so different will appeal to different people but Okay PM Yeah t probably UI Yeah ID Um oh therere a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if its lost PM Mm ME Yeah ID Like a button on a TV you can press and itll ring or something I dont know like or beep ME H I mean like I said before fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ME And if were talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldnt be like a random thing to sort of add in PM Mm ME It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think so Hmm ID Mm PM Yeah thatll probably be good ID Okay we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions ID So lets do that quickly ID Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost UI Yep PM Yeah ID And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Large accessible buttons for the essentials ID We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions PM Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but theyre uh theyre not as prominent as the main features ID Mmhmm ID Um yeah hidden way ID And we also want it to be fashionable which Im not sure if thats a function so much as a um yeah Mmhmm ME on your coffee table its not like an eye sore that kind of thing PM Yeah PM Alright ID Okay do it ID Any other essential functions that we need ID Battery ID Do we need a longlife battery PM Battery battery use PM Yeah but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really ME Yeah ID But we might as well ME So you never have to change the battery PM Yeah UI We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all UI I suspect the remote control does need a battery but I dunno if you can Yeah ID Yeah I would imagine PM Yeah ID Just cause it is an electronic device the Charging PM Mm PM It I think it does PM I dont I dont think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one UI Yeah without the energy yeah PM But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone or like a little cradle for your iPod UI Yeah thats thats possible PM You could we could maybe do that instead UI Yeah PM So you dont ha you got like a rechargeable battery UI Yeah PM I dunno that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place ID Mmhmm ME Mm ID We have to think about um space in livingrooms too like cause theyre I mean would you put it on top of the TV PM Mm ID I dont know just think okay thats thats a good idea well keep it PM Yeah ID Think its And maybe fun PM Thats just off the top of my head ID Okay ID Um kay were gonna conclude now has everyone said their functions and kay UI Yep ID Um after the meeting were gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary ID I dont know what summarisation ID Um and then well have our lunch break ID After that we have thirty minutes of individual work ID Um Ill make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides ID If everyone could do that as well thatd be great ID Um you each have individual actions I um ID Industrial Design youve your components concept User Interface the user interface concept market trend wa watching ID And as as per last time youll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach emailed to you ID And hopefully I hope next time youll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could PM Yeah who knows ID Its kinda frustrating but um Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary PM Okay Sounds good ID Mm kay ID Great seeing yall ME Its good ME Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder PM Yes I just did that ME Okay PM Hopefully it is there for people ME Yep PM Yeah ID Looks like there are um looks like theres a second one kind of of mine thats that I didnt do its from like an earlier project I think so um Under the shared folder I dont know it might not even be under yours as well PM Yeah PM Okay ME Where is that ME Yours is I only have three I just have like our three PM Technical PM So in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements ID Projects PM At least thats what I have in PM Yeah thats what I have as well R Rose So ME Yeah ID Okay ID You dont have mine ME No but thats cause I think yours is in the email separate like its not on the server ID S Mm PM Yeah ME But if I open it and then save it probably will be there ME Oh wait never mind you cant save it to the Okay ID Okay ID Well Ill figure that out in the meantime PM Okay ID Okay,"The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes, finding that users wanted fancier looking remotes, disliked losing their remotes, wanted remotes with fewer buttons, frequently use the channel changing and volume buttons, and that younger users wanted speech recognition. The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one. He presented two remotes currently on the market and the advantages and disadvantages to each design. The industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group, the option to include speech recognition, how to find a remote when lost, and batteries."
ID Mmhmm PM Mm yeah ID Okay ID I g yeah ID Time is it ME Fourteen twenty six ID Okay ID Lovely to see you all again ID Um its our conceptual design meeting and its starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so well go just after three oclock ID Um okay our agenda were gonna do an opening Im gonna review the minutes of the last meeting then well have your three presentations um and then well have to make a decision on the remote control concepts and finally well close PM Okay ID So opening ID Um these are our minutes from r the functional design ID We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it because we have international appeal and we said its for all age groups different um functions of it ID Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion ID And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost large buttons for the essential functions a possibility for extra functions like a sliding a sliding piece and a longlife battery or a charging station ID Okay now three presentations ID Id like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of components properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching PM That would be me UI Yep PM Alright PM Well ID Mm ID kay ID Function F eight it ID There we go PM Alright PM Um Im very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it PM Components design PM This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of PM Um PM So we need to examine each element separately but were designing a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole PM The main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as well are the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery PM These are all things that we had sort of addressed before but Im gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like PM The case uh the options that Ive gotten from headquarters about what we can do um theres theres the shape of a case we could do a flat sh a flat case a curved case or maybe even a double doublecurved case PM I havent seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic the m the main base will be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in wood latex titanium rubber or other coloured types of plastic PM That would be our case PM Um buttons for buttons we have um pushbuttons which is what Real Reaction uses the most often but we also have scror scroll wheels which can have integrated pushbuttons or we could go all hightech and have an L LCD screen ID Mm PM Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are PM And then battery I think is where things get most exciting PM Were talking about longlife batteries here PM Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A batteries but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery like are used in hightech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up PM Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery PM Or a solar battery although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we cant use a latex case if we have a solar battery ID Hmm PM Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago flashlights PM Not quite sure what that is but thats the description that I received so thats what Im passing on to you PM So those are our options PM Um personal preferences that I was thinking through heres what weve been talking about all through fashion and simplicity PM So if were going for fashion in our cases I think that what were gonna wanna look at is a curved or a doublecurved case probably with a variety of design elements PM Maybe titanium maybe some wood PM Were gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials but thats sort of what I have in mind PM And we wanna go for simplicity PM Probably pushbuttons but Im sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel if anyone has anything any ideas on that ID Mm PM I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what theyre describing so that might be something we wanna look into PM And Im really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery PM Solar I dont think would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light PM But this idea of the kinetic that you dont have to replace and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work I think that that m would be a very interesting thing PM But I think wed also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down PM Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if were gonna start using an LCD PM So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they dont need to be cause thatll keep our manufacturing price way down PM Thats what I have for options PM Um Id appreciate anyones input but thats what Im seeing for the future of the the look of this thing ME Is doublecurved like would be like two hands kind of thing PM Im not sure PM I havent received any specific visuals of this yet ME Okay ME Cause Im imagining like doublecurved is like you know like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single verticalish kind of looking thing but Ive no idea PM This is what Im sort of Yeah PM Im not sure but Ill let you know as soon as I get any pictures ME Sounds good ID Yeah I wonder Mmhmm PM I know if we do have a doublecurved case it cant have any titanium in it PM But the titanium they were quite theyre marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme so that could be quite interesting PM Spaceage remote PM Just all things to keep in mind ID Just an interesting marketing kind of element PM Yeah PM Thats about all I have to do guys PM I hope I didnt go through that too quickly ID Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements have you no idea okay PM Yeah n no idea no idea PM Um Im assuming that a kinetic battery isnt gonna take up that much weight and that a tita titanium is very light I know um but other than thats really basic I mean thats all I have gotten so far ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM Alright PM Any other questions UI Uhhuh UI Dont think so PM No PM Okay ID Mm kay PM I have save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information ID Thank you perfect ME Thanks PM Uh Just in my notebook but if anyone has any specific questions dont hesitate to email me or something ID Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh uh in your book then dont worry about that PM Alright PM Uh I guess I can I know ID Kay now were um concepts concepts of user interface ID Yeah um ID This ones so much tighter than the other one ID Okay ID Nope ID There we go ID Here you are UI Jess PM G oh geez UI Alright so Im gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device UI Um weve talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface UI We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable UI Um other weve also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose UI Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that weve included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people UI We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s thats thats something that that Ill show you some examples of um but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device UI Uh once weve chosen a a concept for it we can then design the features around the concept making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features UI And of course we also have to make it look cool UI So basically thats what we dont want UI M we dont want lots of buttons uh complicated features UI We want something that looks nice and simple UI Heres a a fairly simple device PM Hmm UI This is an an iPod from Apple UI Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons UI Its very minimalistic in its design UI Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small LCD screen UI Um the thing I like about this is that its very very quick to access the main features UI Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track next track and play pause UI Theyre the main the main features of the iPod the things you will use a all the time UI Um then if you want to do anything more advanced you go into the little menu on the LCD screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want UI So I think thats thats a good a good kind of model that we could have UI Um heres a another example UI This is uh its an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool UI Um its certainly got novelty value UI Uh its nice and colourful its nice and bright ID Mm UI Uh its also something that you can kind of feel your way around UI The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if youre watching TV in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which and basically yeah its ith its fun UI So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often UI So youd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels UI I mean most people when they watch TV they have two hundred and fifty channels on their TV and they watch of bout four of them at the most UI So you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume which is something you do all the time when youre watching TV and the button to switch it off in case you get bored UI Um other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the TV uh I dont know what else you do with a TV UI Um but these are these are all necessary functions UI Uh you cant have a t theres no point having a television that you cant tune or that you cant set the contrast so we need to find a way of including these somehow UI Um and one other suggestions Id make is to in is to include in a menu system a bit like on the iPod UI So wed either have a small LCD display on the device itself or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device PM Hmm UI And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often ID Okay PM So youd be advocating an LCD then UI I think thats thats one way to go yes PM Okay UI Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display its its nice because its it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair PM Mmhmm UI There are disadvantages an an LCD display would have to be quite small cause were were I well were I assume were gonna be making quite a small device PM Right UI Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it cause you ten you tend to watch TV in the dark but you need to be able to see your LDD LCD display ID Mmhmm PM Right UI The alternative is to have a an onscreen display on your television that you control through your remote control UI Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo whats on each channel ID Mmhmm UI I mean that thats also a good idea PM Okay UI Its it can it does have its problems as well if youve got a small TV and youre sitting on the other side of a room its hard to read the little text that comes up ID Mm PM Mmhmm UI Uh but thats a thats a design decision that we can make PM Kay ID I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing whats on ID Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where its um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it UI Yeah PM Well Are you are you tak Yeah UI Yeah ID Like I I know I use that often enough ME Wait but is that separate from what he was saying ID Well if it if it was a L LCD on th on the remote I dont know that you could f that youd be able to see a Okay PM No I think I think were talking menu like contrast and tuning the VCR or something if Ive understood you correctly rather than menu as whats on UI Yeah that that would be one of the features yes ID Okay UI But its its its something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way so you cant have the televisions and information back to the remote control at least I dont think you can ID Cause that would be more specifically a digital box mmhmm PM Oh good point ID Mm UI Um Im not sure PM Yeah ID Okay now were moving on to market ME Should I plug that in ID Marketing UI Is that going on UI Okay ME Maybe its just not Is it on UI Uh that should be alright actually ME Ri What F do you have to press five ID Eight ME I just keep pressing lots of em ME Well I dont know how relevant all of this gonna be ME If anything the that they gave me PM No signal ID Oops its not plugged in quite in well enough ME Alright ID There we are PM Oop there we go ID Mm kay ME Oh yeah ME Okay so were gonna look a little bit at trend watching ME Basically I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year ME So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls and right now i d theyre saying that currently theres a functional look and feel preference but that really over the next year it it thats gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so even though were stressing when were talking weve all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea theyre sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that its fancy look and feel ME And as these are ranked the top one is doubly important to the second one which is doubly important to the third one so just to take that weight into account PM Okay ME The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations ME That would be like if we use something like the space material or the LCD screen things like that ME And then ease of use was the third most important whi so really no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel according to this ME I dont know how much we agree with that ME And then the fashion watch talks about that this years top trend for clothes shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that theres a preference for spongy tight material ID S sweet ME And so that brings us to my personal preferences ME Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding ME Personally I dont really think that I want one thats gonna go out of style or go stale excuse the pun um in a year so even though this is coming from us as you know trend watch market research I dont know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away ME Also considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction Im a little hesitant as to like how these questions may have been worded and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking ME Personally like I might reverse it but if were working for this company then I guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most ME But it doesnt necessarily need to be a spongy material PM Mm PM That theres all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though ME Yeah ME I dont have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up ME So yeah ID Okay do we have any s some questions for this lets see um ME Yeah what can I possibly enlighten on ID Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ID Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ID Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ID It would be easier on the hands PM If its latex if its latexy Um mean An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that its in fact hard to protect stuff inside but that its covered with the latex which is spongier and softer on your hands ID Its kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that I dunno UI A kind of thing that Yeah ID But Mmhmm PM Its theres something to be said I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R R repetitive stress injuries and things and and Yeah something grippable I mean we dont we dont we dont wanna go spongy maybe ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Yeah so something m m instead of a necess yeah grip Im thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands you know i and I think Im envisioning more like you know the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesnt hurt when youre sitting down for a long time like Im imagining that sort of thing I dont know what th that materials called UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm PM Yeah I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded its that seems doable PM could we go in fruit and vegetable colours PM We could colourcoordinate them li The buttons could be fruitshaped ID F for sure or maybe like um couple main ones being like I dunno lemons or strawberries or something ID Could they be smelly UI I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable PM Oh well its quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isnt it ME Oh God UI Uh like uh I dunno like uh carrots or something ID I dont know ID Or carrot shaped mm UI Maybe or Kind of like a potato PM Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits ID Like large button thats what I was thinking of yeah ME What about the idea of like a round remote ME Instead of like a vertical up and down one ME Like in terms of holding it ME Like thats a f shape of a fruit PM be yeah PM Itd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think ME Just to tie it in a little ID Might would you think you you do you think youd be able to hold it UI Yeah ID Cause I think the reason theyre long is yeah PM Itd be harder to press button UI Depends ID Harder to push UI When you when you use a remote do you press the buttons with your thumb usually ME Yeah UI Or your fingers PM Um I Yeah thats ts how I tend to do it ID I usually hold it in one hand ID Maybe But then the buttons would have to be very small UI Or maybe you want something thats shaped like a mobile phone so you you hold it in one hand and you press the buttons with your thumb ME Yeah cause otherwise your fingers cant move around ID Dont you think PM No just thumbsized PM Jus Yeah ME But I like i I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod ID But I mean in order to get to all of them you know UI Yeah ID They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other UI Maybe PM Thats true UI But if youve only got like four or five buttons anyway then its its not so much a problem perhaps PM Right PM I When Im when Im pressing buttons on my iPod thats how I do it hold it and press the four ID Mmhmm UI So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and And you find that works quite well PM Yeah PM Yeah or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel ID Mmhmm PM Yeah It wel well yeah it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different but Oh yeah you had one of the inbetween ones when they werent doing that anymore ID Mmhmm UI Is that The button on an iPod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ME Cause th Its like five cause theres one in the middle ID Its a scroll yeah its a wheel ID The one I have doesnt have the four on i like around it I dont think PM Ts and you press the centre button thats thats your allpurpose select button right there UI Right UI Oh I see right yeah UI Oh okay PM Since its the one in the centre thats not marked yeah UI Yeah thats quite a good design ME I think why it would be good for us is cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume PM Yeah ME Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things but then how you could go back to the menu and like I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual TV PM Uh uh t Yeah ME I kind of am wanting to say on the TV cause if youre changing the brightness dont you wanna see it happening kind of PM Hmm ID Mm UI Yeah PM Yeah ME And then you could still have that available PM Yeah I think an LCD screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice UI I think it could be difficult in practice yeah PM Yeah UI Also z yeah cause you would be z looking down at the LCD screen than back up at your TV and people dont wanna do that ME Mmhmm PM Right ME Mmhmm PM Um Oh we probably have to get going dont we ID Okay um we have weve about fifteen minutes left so Im Im gonna continue with my pres presentation ME Uhhuh ID Um Ive one more slide before we close but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things so Ill just bring that up and show you all before we move on PM Kay ID Um Yeah and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium ME If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables Ill let you know PM Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile UI Like to make it different fruits PM In different fruit and vegetable colours yeah UI Yeah its possible PM Exactly PM And you could coordinate with your house or whatever UI I think maybe th the packaging it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel PM All these options UI So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it and the remote controls inside PM Ooh ME Well there we go PM Oh UI Dont know ID Ah hmm hmm hmm ME The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun ME Its like the way it all comes all cute PM Yeah PM Mm ME Lemons PM Options ID Okay um components concept ID Energy chip on print PM Uhhu oh oh yes PM Right I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldnt get be necessary but um Alright so um decisions what the okay deci decisions on energy Im thinking is based on the battery ID G Thats th th this is the agenda they gave me ID So can you just explain what that is real quick ID Mmhmm PM Um I dunno what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ID I think its awesome ID I think its really cool PM Am I Yeah ME Yeah I mean it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries PM Yeah UI Yeah um I think its good as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is but as far as I know the technology is good PM Right I havent gotten any yeah any more information on cost other than its more expensive than a regular battery but um but if were using a an i a cheaper chip then itll even out I think ME Costs ME But over time Yeah its a But if you c if you could scroll through the channels and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way forward and backward as Im just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking PM Um circuit boards PM Um yeah I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced PM Theyre theyre thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them and di I think theyre quite easily printed on by machine which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us PM I dont really know what to tell you as far as decisions PM I wasnt really given any options I was just given that this is how theyre done ID Okay PM Um yeah I cant cant really tell you PM I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works PM But I dont know any decisions on Yeah ID If theyre if theyre really options PM Im sorry I did f Yeah ID Okay UI Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same I think UI Uh its fairly fairly standard ID Um okay then well move on to the case ID Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or an advanced chip maybe PM Right PM Well okay heres the heres the thing on the chips that I that I got PM Um simple regular advanced chip on print PM The chip on print includes an infrared sensor so we dont have to worry about that PM Um kay the pushbutton if were gonna have pushbuttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an LCD requires advanced PM Do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want pushbuttons UI Um I dont think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel UI I mean it might be nice for changing the volume PM Oh ID It would be nice for changing the volume but I dont know how useful itd be for changing the channel UI Uh but I dont think it would really work ID Cause you dont have control over numbers or We have five minutes left for the meeting so UI Yeah you really need buttons for changing a channel PM Yeah th itd be itd be handy for going through if there was an onscreen menu of your channel choices than you can scroll down on the scroll UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME And otherwise no matter how may buttons we have were gonna have like you know black with red sticking out and th no its gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Hmm ID So have a scroll for volume PM F or for all those secret functions ID F Um PM When you get on the onscreen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus UI I think yeah I think a scroll wheel would be nice but its not necessary PM Right UI Um Yeah PM So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip depending and maybe we could table that decision for later PM I dont know ID I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface were gonna have to decide the interface were gonna have to decide um whether were gonna have a scroll or not PM Okay PM Well lets think about that while we talk about the case ID Okay lets do case PM Uh Im kinda liking the idea of latex if if spongy is the in thing ID Im a little um Im a little hesitant about it because Im worried about protecting the stuff on the inside PM Okay ID Um Yeah I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing ME Oh could it be hard and then something around it PM Uh yeah everything Ive N oh wha what Ive what Ive seen just not related to this but of latex cases before is that theres uh like a hard plastic inside and its just covered with the latex ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM Not too thick a layer of latex just enough to be grippable like bike handles or or anything that youve seen like that ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM The inside is hard PM I dont think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board I think that thats done for us ID Ge o Okay UI Kay UI Yeah ID So we uh we do want latex UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Okay ID Latex ID Um and probably in colours maybe fruity vegetable colours PM Yeah ID Fruity colours ID Okay um lets go to the ufe user interface then well come back to the chip I suppose PM Oh and we want a curved case yeah PM Or a doublecurved ID Well we dont really know what the difference is right ME Im thinking curved of some sort ID Yeah PM Yeah okay UI Yeah PM We dont really know what the difference Good point ID Um okay interface the type and the supplements ID So push or scroll right UI Um Yep ID Or both UI Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down we should just go for pushbuttons cause then we can have a a simple chip and its simpler its its cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button UI So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics its probably better to have pushbuttons ID Mmhmm ID And if we had a sc an onscreen um kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things UI Yeah yeah its uh its its fairly simple ID I think that yeah ID For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPods kind of scroll thing would be too fast I dunno PM Yeah PM I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton but its gotta be some more expensive so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case because Yeah UI Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Is that okay with you UI Interesting ID How you feeling ME Yeah ME And lets like see if we get anything else ME I mean Im not like hardsold on the scroll wheel its more just to give it a different kind of look but if its gonna be in a latex type thing and thats gonna look cool then thats probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel ID Mmhmm ID It might be cool enough ID Okay so were gonna go with um type pushbuttons and then supplements how are we gonna do that UI Yep UI Uh what do you mean by supplements exactly ID Um I assume thats what else were gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use UI Um Yep PM Oh ID So were gonna have like a menu button so that we can access onscreen things then UI Yeah ID Okay um so were doing an onscreen menu that we can scroll through PM Alright UI Um in Yeah PM So what are what are our buttons gonna be PM On off So like one through five or No UI On off uh volume favourite channels uh and menu UI Yeah yeah about yeah like yeah a bit like radio presets ME Like a radio type sorta situation UI Um Uh we wouldnt even need the numbers ID Preset channels and then were gonna need um numbers one through zero right UI I think maybe numbers seems is kind of oldfashioned ID Well but in order to preset a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when youre scrolling through UI Yeah yeah you can just and you need some kind of I dunno sort of up down kind of button but the volume control could double for that for example PM Mm PM Yeah up down ID Mmhmm ID Okay um finishing the meeting now ID Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes um you each have things to do look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay ID Youll get specific instructions from your personal coach PM Ooh UI Cool ME Wow ID Um did we decide on a chip ID Lets go with a simple chip PM Simple chip UI Yep ID Okay ID We are done ID Thank you everyone ID Oh I di these are already in our shared folder so PM Okay cool PM Clay UI Clay UI I wasnt expecting that,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, options for buttons, and options for batteries. The interface specialist presented two existing products which incorporate features the team is seeking to embed in their remote. The interface specialist also discussed other features to possibly incorporate into the design of the remote, such as an LCD screen. The marketing expert discussed recent findings from trend watching reports and how to incorporate these findings into the remote design with respect to what materials to use and the overall appearance of the product. The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product. The team then discussed other options for batteries, chips, buttons, and materials for the case, as well as the option to have a menu function."
ID Okay um welcome to our detailed design meeting ID Im pretty excited ID Lets start its approximately fifteen forty or something like that ID Okay um the agenda were gonna do an opening and then um Ill talk about the minutes from the last meeting what we d discussed um then well have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria ID Well look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close ID So starting off with the um last the last one oh I dont have it here um but we talked about energy were gonna use a kinetic battery um we want to use a simple chip because were not gonna need a a shuffle um were gonna need a scroll um were choosing a latex case w in fruity colours thats curved and um were using push buttons uh with a supplement of an onscreen menu ID And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons including five preset channels ID Okay ID Lets do the look and feel design presentation first UI Right do you wanna start PM Right well we made three different prototypes and I guess well start with with this one PM Um we have our colours not are not fixed but this is the general shape PM Um its you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh its easily adaptable to either hand PM You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand or even I mean theres a whole variety you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger PM Uh we have the on off button at the tip very visible very big PM We have our up and down buttons which are also gonna be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button here PM If you push if youre just pushing these normally theyre the menu buttons if uh the volume buttons rather PM If you press select once they become channel changing buttons PM If we press select three times the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here PM Um if people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels in your hand PM Thats our number one prototype PM Um do you wanna present the potato or shall I present the Martian ID like a little lightning in it UI Okay um What We call that one the rhombus uh the rhombus ID The little lightning bolt in it very cute ME I could Could the middle button of the onscreen menu function as a power button ID The v the rhombus rhombus PM Thats the rhombus yep UI Um this one is known as the potato uh its its a how can I present it UI Its an ergonomic shape so it it fits in your hand nicely UI Um its designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand UI Um Ive gone here just for just for four buttons on this one UI Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume UI So youve got volume up and volume down on the other side here UI Um the red ones are for uh changing channels channel up and channel down and thats um moves between your favourite channels that youve selected UI Uh this middle button here brings up the onscreen menu and when youre working in the onscreen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and thats basically it thats the potato ID Um on off UI Uh that would be one of your channels basically so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off yeah ID Okay ID Yeah we turn it off UI Um not really it would make it hard to turn the machine off to turn your TV off ID Mmhmm PM If you pressed and held it maybe UI Yeah yeah that thatd be one way of doing it yeah ME If you like held it down that would be on off PM Yeah UI Thatd work yeah PM On off thats a possibility yeah ID Okay PM And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear either way PM Um its a bit different just a little bit more of a creative feel PM Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top PM We have the five preset seeds PM And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more threedimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle PM So thats for your consideration as well plus its an interesting talking point to have standing up UI Lets pass PM We figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if I made the bot the bottom flat ID Uhhuh ME Sorry whats the yellow one in the middle I forgot PM Uh the menu select button ID Very interesting ID I think that ones my favourite UI So thats So thats our three prototypes UI Um basically in terms of making decisions what wed need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want then decide what kind of button layout we want how many buttons and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever ID Mmhmm PM We were we were thinking that normally wed go for fruity colours but maybe were also thinking that your sort of middle aged man for an example customer might not want a fruity coloured remote so m maybe wed have one version thats a bit toned down maybe with with less contrasts on it ID Mm kay PM Yeah something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but yeah UI Would Yeah but we dont want it to look like a kids toy ID Now that was one thing that we brought up over email ID I dont know if you picked up your email but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost UI Yeah PM Right PM Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive that it its not just like another piece of technology around your house PM Its gonna be somewhere that it can be seen ID Mmhmm PM So were were not thinking that its gonna be as critical to have the loss I think Yeah ME But if its like under covers or like in a couch you still cant see it ID Its really Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno you tape to your to your TV um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ID Do you think that would be conceptually possible UI I think it would be difficult technologically because if your if your remotes lost its probably under the settee and in that case you cant you cant send an infrared sing signal to it to find it s so its Im not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if its if its more just a gimmick then anything else ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Thats true mm kay UI Uh I mean ho how many times do you really seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it PM There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon ID Mmhmm ID Okay thats a fair evaluation ID Getting lost ID Um we so we do weve decided not to worry about that for now ID Okay cause well the designs are very bright so youre right theyre gonna stick out but um Mmhmm PM So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality PM Um ME I feel like this is simil or its sort of what already exists so if were trying to think of something sort of like new and fun even though this is like what youre init Im initially drawn to just cause its like comfortable and like not different ME I sort of like this one like I I dont know why it just its like small but still sort of like cute looking I dunno ME But I also like the b the side buttons on that one like I think thats kind of neat ME But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on ID Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ID So then w we wouldnt have to have like a dual function PM Mm yeah thats good thats good ME Ah there we go UI Yeah its possible yeah yeah PM Here stick it on UI Put an extra the button on ID Sure ID Um uh why dont we do a product evaluation using your criteria if youve developed some ME Well do we w like I think were supposed to have one that we do it for ID Oh okay ID Okay ME That was I was a little vague on what exactly Im supposed to do but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard so PM So where Right ID Okay ID Do you need this or just write on the white board ME No I actually dont have like a PowerPointy thing cause I think it would be redundant ID Okay PM Okay ME I dunno ID Its kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing you know kinda push it PM Ooh UI Cool PM Hey ID Kay ID Maybe a little smaller than that PM No I kinda like it PM Thats hard to miss UI It makes look more fruity as well ID Oh it does its kind of like There it could have a stem like that cause I do l kind of like the stem UI Its like a deformed foot I dunno UI Yeah PM Like Yeah ID Yeah ID It almost helps you ge keep a grip too cause it goes in between fingers UI Yeah PM Interesting ID I like this one PM Okay is that where people are leaning then the potato ID Variety of colours are nice PM I like the idea of the I mean thats really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down that one ID I think Im leaning towards the potato ID Mmhmm ID I am worried about like um using a menu ID Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus and so how do you get back to the main menu PM Hmm UI Yeah PM Well that on the iPod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level ID But that has a menu button separate from a select button whereas if this ones both the menu and the select button UI Yeah PM Good point UI This is its the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices ID Okay UI You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh ID Could these be used for going to submenus or Okay UI Yeah UI Yeah so theyre used for going into and out of your submenus yeah PM Maybe yeah maybe it can be one of those if you press down and hold for two seconds then it brings you back one level or something ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID Well as long as we have that in mind as were designing it still mm kay ME Okay so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities the yellowy one is that Okay well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one PM The potato PM Are we leaning towards the potato UI Potato ID I think so PM Okay ME So basically what we need to do is some of the things that weve talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to PM Okay ME So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then Ill tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that PM Okay ME So well just go through them one at a time and well just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all or false if the remote that weve created conforms to the following criteria ME So we can do this one first ME First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective ME So like in my opinion the for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so Im gonna say its like a three ME Thats just my opinion PM Yeah ME What does each of you Okay well give it a number sorry ID I I kind of think its its unique enough that Id give it a one or a two ID Okay ID I will give it a one PM Um I dunno if its its creative PM I dunno if fancy is the word I would use PM I dunno if any of them are fancy in Id say two because c unique ME Okay ME And two awesome UI Ill go for two ME Alright and same sort of scale for functionality is it functional ME I think its extremely functional Im gonna give it a one PM Yeah one ME One UI I think its its functional its also pretty basic so Ill give it a two ME Okay ID Um functional ID I think itll get everything done I think it might be a little confusing at first um I dont know if thats gonna be a later one ME Okay ME Well theres some other ones I will address that yeah ID Okay then Im gonna give it a two ME Awesome okay ME Um we wanna know next if its technologically innovative ID Did you give a functional ME Yeah she said it was one ID Okay ME Um is it technologically innovative ME Mm ME Not really I mean not so much cause we we dont have the LCD screen we dont have fancy chip ME Other than what it looks like I dunno if its really I kinetic battery is a big one so ID Well the kinetic battery PM In the battery thats it PM How many people would notice that though ME Mm ME But it but we know its there ID But theyll notice it after like a year theyll be like hey I have never changed the battery ME And if its made of like latex that whole idea thats pretty cool ID Mm ME Ill give it a three ID Just the material ME Cause it we couldve picked a lot of features that wouldve made it really Alright PM Yeah PM I I would say that its Yeah like fancy versus creative its its different PM But does that equal innovative PM I dunno PM Ill give it a three ME Everyone else UI Id say its technologically its not its not unique I mean its its just it is just pushbuttons um so I Id give it a four ID Think Im gonna go with the four as well ME Mm kay ID I really like that kinetic battery though ME Next is it easy to use ME Just so you know easy to learn will be separate so dont overlap them ID Mm kay PM Okay ME I think its really easy to use ME Ill give it a two PM Um Ill give it a one PM Pretty hard to mess up UI Ill say one ID Uh lets say two ME Alright ME Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed its made of latex or rubber I its spongy all the way ID Give it a one ME Yeah PM Yeah UI I wonder if it bounces when you drop it PM Ooh that you couldnt itd be harder to break harder to lose ME Mmhmm ID Mm UI Yeah ID Cause there would be less impact maybe ME Iain what do you give it PM Mm UI Yeah Id Id give it a one ME Alright and the next is does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables UI Uh um ME Well is it gonna be yellow PM It it might be cause thats our corporate colour isnt it ID Thats right yeah corporate colour we didnt keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a design in and the outside in yellow thatd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one one thats more fruity UI Yeah PM We might wanna keep it yellow ME Yeah but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something PM Yeah UI Yeah Yeah ID Um and can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something PM If we had a yellow Sure ID Okay ME Oh yeah ME Alright so I think it its Yeah ID Fruity so fruity PM So it was inspired by the potato so I think its pretty fruity ID I think i its kind of mangoey too PM Oh mango that that Thats a much more trendy than a potato one ME Yeah UI Mangoey is better yeah ME I okay Im giving it a one the mango put me over ID Yes UI I like mangoes ID Mm ME What are whats everyones numbers UI Uh two ID One ME Alright um and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ME Remember earlier we discussed that people dont use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most ME I think we really took that into account a lot so Im gonna give it a one ID Mmhmm PM Yeah me too UI Uh one ME Did you say one Rose ID Yes ME Okay um also we talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing ME Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ME I think Ill give it a two cause I almost feel like no matter what you do something is gonna happen ID Its gonna be hard PM Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID And if its repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that youre constantly pushing but um I like how it fits in the hand though so I Id go with a two ME Um um worth the risk I think PM Yeah PM Ill Ill say two as well PM Because older people that arent used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first but The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but I think if its one its one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but youll have it afterwards ID Mm ME Kay UI Yeah Ill Ill say two ME Alright awesome ME And the ease of learning it ME I know you were saying that youre a little bit nervous about that I dunno ME It sort of reminds me of the iPod ME I just got mine I still havent read the instruction book and Im doing okay so and Im not good at learning technology ID Mm ME So Ill give it a two ID Mmhmm PM So Id I think Id give it a two I guess UI I think it its probably a little harder then most remotes to learn because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first but once youve yeah once youd learned how to use it I think it is a lot easier PM Oh good point ME Mmhmm UI So Id Id give it a four ME Okay ID I think Id give it a four too ID Its a pretty high learning curve itll be easy once youve done it but We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour but Mmhmm ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Alright um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now were not addressing that at all so Okay so in terms of not losing it do you think that on a scale of one to seven how easy or hard is it to lose ME Im gonna Im gonna give it a four cause I think that you can still if its in between somewhere where you cant see it youre kind of not gonna find it but anywhere else its gonna stand out UI Yeah PM Um Id say Id give it uh a three I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally ID Mm Id give it a four UI Um Ill give it a five cause i it would be easy to lose something like that yeah ID Small too ME Alright we also said simplicity how w how well does it address just being simple PM Simple to use or simple in design PM Do you know ME I think overall cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion so those are the next two things were gonna look at ME Separate from fancy like that sort of thing PM Right ME Um it like wants to be simple but its not like totally totally simple so Im gonna give it a two PM Im give it a three I guess UI Ill give it a two ID Three ME Alright and fashionable ID Its totally fashionable ME Its hot I mean its a mango come on ID Id give it a one ID Mango ME I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ME I think its bringing technology and fashion together real really well PM I dunno PM I dont think its quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was ID I do like uh the little Martian one ME Yeah the toggle on off switch its really appealing ME Number PM Um two UI Three ID One ME And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal that whole thing ME Just that it would se serve our audience ME I dont see why not ID Mmhmm ID I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements ID Um yeah thats good PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ID So Ill give it a a two PM Yeah Ill say two ME Alright did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didnt talk about ID Well um we didnt we didnt address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo so lets lets make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an RR on it PM Shall we uh Well I think all of them should have an RR ID All of them should have RR yeah ME And so were gonna do that so it will address it fine ID Mmhmm ID Mm kay ME Okay ME Thats me ID Lovely ID Okay now were gonna look at finances ID Um I have an Excel sheet that were actually gonna calculate the cost um so let me exit out of this first ID Okay um I know ME Whoa PM Oh my ID Let me one more space ID Gonna zoom in real quick ID Okay ID Hand dynamo ID Were using kinetic battery right PM Uh were n using kinetic yeah ID Um and were having one per One okay PM Yeah ID Um electronics PM Single PM Simple simple rather ID Simple ME Simple ID Mm kay ID Um the case PM Uh uh uh doublecurved UI Guess its doublecurved UI It is pretty curvy ME Yeah ID Its very curvy so okay PM Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I dont really know PM Our case material supplements oops we just skipped by them ME Well dont we need plastic and Provided okay PM No we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed PM The supplement is Oh I guess it was rubber rather than latex ID The wood ID I mean the rubber ME It was rubber and special colour right PM Yeah ID Mmhmm okay ME Do we have more than one special colour ID Yeah were using were gonna need at least two special colours PM Uh well I dont know what the se the basic colour is though UI Special colours isnt it ID Um ME Per Well but we know that were having at least three colours so Right ID I dunno where it yeah ID So lets y say three PM Well are we talking about on each colour combination or are we you know well like well have yellow and black PM Is that two special colours ID Yeah I dunno PM Or or is white and black then two more or Uh ID That I thi I thought that would be under yours PM I guess its three three three ID Well just say three ID Mmhmm PM Alright ID Maybe the RR will be in colour as well so yeah ID Interface were doing push buttons PM Yeah ID And how many buttons do we have ME We have six UI Weve got five ME Oh no five PM Six with the power UI Oh six ID Six PM Yeah ID Anything else PM No PM Oh well do we wa Are the buttons in special colour special f I didnt get information on Well does it but if were making multiple varieties of this is where Im getting confused ME Oh wait ID Oh buttons oh so um ID So the case material will just have one colour right but then the buttons will be in special colours ME Yeah ID Were saying per unit PM per unit okay okay ME Yeah per unit ID Okay so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours cause that how its designed there PM Alright and each button s Yeah okay ME Yeah UI Yeah ME I like it like that ID So Special form ID Theyre all kind of just push button right PM No I think theyre fine UI Yeah ID Special material PM Material we want them rubber as well probably yeah ID Uh ID Oh do I have to do it per button do I PM No I dont think so PM I think theyre if theyre all gonna be rubber then it thats what it matters ID Okay ME Yeah cause it wouldnt make sense otherwise cause for the whole mat case material its only one PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Its I mean its two to make it rubber PM Okay ME Oh wait so maybe ID Thirteen point seven PM Oh oh ID Yeah what can we reduce PM Okay lets have our buttons all be one colour ME Mm I kind of like the buttons ID Lets see what that would do ID Its only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway PM Alright ID Okay um are we sure this is doublecurved PM Uh ID Maybe its singlecurved we have no idea PM We have no idea PM I dunno I didnt get any pictures ME Its single curved PM Its single curved PM Why not ID Well its not the yeah ID Okay its the kinetic battery thats kind of expensive but we have a simple chip single curve case material is rubber and its a special colour but thats important PM Yeah PM That is important ID Six buttons we have to have six buttons PM How did it get more expensive what did you just change ID What PM It was it was thirteen and now its fifteen ID No okay maybe not ID I dont know what just happened ID Now its twelve ME We Yeah they are UI What was our target price again PM Twelve point five ID Twelve point five PM Hey hey UI Twelve point five UI So were just just about there ID So were okay I think PM Were all set then ID Yeah PM Ish ID Okay were all set PM Alright ID Um save ID I saved that to our um our big shared folder so you know ID Um okay back to agenda ID Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro PM Yes ID Yes UI Yeah ID Lets move on to the project evaluation ID Project process ID Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity leadership teamwork the means any new ideas found ID So I guess what were gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project the information we got on the news how we used it if we were able to um you know use our creativity with the information um how how well I guess I led it um the how well we worked together as a team um the digital pens the whiteboard PM Well ID Okay PM I felt very creative PM I enjoyed making the prototypes UI I think weve been successful in that weve achieved almost all of the design goals that weve set and weve come up with a finished project and we just about got cost PM Yeah PM I think we couldve done even better with a little bit more information like whats a singlecurved case how many colours what do colours count things but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Um I think we worked together pretty well UI Yeah ME Yeah I mean if Id had more market research on the fruits and vegetables maybe we couldve taken that into account ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM But the fruits and vegetables they really my creativity so ME I know I really did the the whole mango idea was great ME No I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally like its heaviness and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages I dunno PM Do you think we could Yeah ME That was a bit of a distraction ME That was the last one like I chose not to do a PowerPoint cause I didnt think it made sense to so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID I think we all made um very significant contributions I dont think anybody dominated it which I thought was really good like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over um I like our little finished products PM Yeah ME Theyre funny ID Really cute ME I kind of want one PM Can we market this as the mango remote PM Should we have that somewhere on the packaging PM I have a little RR ME Im trying to think of a good pun that I could add there ID I know lets think of it like a little jingle ID Um ME I like the RR thats gonna be etched in PM Yes PM Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um its quite a useful little gadget PM All thanks to Iain for the design of that one ID Okay um new ideas found PM Mm PM What did we find for new ideas PM People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables ID Definitely UI Yeah ID Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera PM I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them ID Oh Im so excited ME Yeah I didnt even know they existed PM That was I I knew you can get watches that had them like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery cause youre always moving your wrist ID Mmhmm PM But in other things I think itd be really good ID I thi yeah thats awesome ID Um okay closing ID Are the costs within the budget ID Is the project evaluated PM Yes ID Now theres the final questionnaire and meeting summary ID Um so this is the great product kids I think weve created something really interesting and that we have a market for it um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um yeah PM Yeah ID Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and ME Yeah Real Reaction ID I do like the Martian remote ID If we could choose more than one that would be my second choice ME Oh that would definitely be my second choice UI Mm ID Although the tog toggle Im afraid I would Its cool UI Thats cool UI Lets all lets all go for the yellow Break the stem off ME I would break it ME I would break it ID I think I would break it PM It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright so Is it started as a pear but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the Take me to your leader ME Oh thats funny ME Kind of looks like a penguin like with no eye ID Oh yeah its kind of a penguin ME I like that it stands up ID Mmmm PM Wow maybe I should market it to some remote control company now PM So are are poor little thing UI That was bound to happen Mm ME Oh sad ID Mm kay congratulations ID Um ID Anything else to say ME Nothing will come up until after our meetings supposed to be over its all timed ID Alright PM Oh ID Um anybody have I got more master classes anybody else wanna like take a masters class ME Oh PM Its really funny that you got spam in your work emails ID Yeah but check it out ID So like there are all these like links they dont go anywhere ID But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management ID Um just wanna make sure you do ME No the first one that you sent like I didnt realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ID Oh It is ME Its very its very work relevant cause people send spam a lot ID Yes definitely Im very sad that I didnt get any links to the corporate website ME Oh here you can you can view PM Lets see what did I get through the corporate website PM Its just inspiration about circuit boards ME You can just see whats up ID Wow ME Yeah its its really deep ME Hold on ME Takes a little while to get excited to load ME That the Excel thing is pretty cool ID Yes PM Yeah that is pretty neat ME Here like basically its like inspiration basically Im gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing see ID I love Excel its one of my favourite programs ME You didnt miss out that much ID I see mm PM Yeah my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit talking about circuit boards ID Spongy PM I learned a lot actually ME Oh wow PM I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to ME This one was cooler ME I got a whole table and everything PM Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down because I thought it would be relevant like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then theyre like you dont actually need this you just need to talk about the case ME Thats like mine it was like would you prefer an LCD screen or a multifunction remote control ME And then it didnt have like any kind of table like awesome Im glad they asked that question and didnt report the result PM Its really interesting though ID I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing PM Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah ID We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool UI I think UI Yeah PM That was really neat how I got emails and No UI We didnt we didnt use the whiteboard that much ID Mmhmm ID No ID Although I dont see how we could have very l at least for me I Mm PM I yeah PM If Id gotten pictures of the different parts of the case the different looks of the case I would have probably drawn them up but Yeah we couldve put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but with only four people it doesnt really make sense ME Cause we werent like voting on anything and I think usually like whiteboards are good you know like crossing out ideas or like if we had had like a brainstorming period ID Mmhmm ME But I thought we were good orally ME Get crazy PM I think if you had a larger group Yeah ID And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as thats not as necessary to have UI Yeah ME And these mightve made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here cause we all needed them separately kind of on the whiteboards in this room ID Mm ID Mmhmm PM Because were all gonna be working in different places ME Yeah PM We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time then having the notes up on the whiteboard wouldve been alright but everyone needs their own like specific notes I guess ID Mmhmm ID Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here did you work together or did you like do separate projects UI Uh we we worked together um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work um and how we could like improve on the on the design PM Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM So it was a bit of both really we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey mangoey shape and then just went from there really ID Mmhmm ID Cool PM It was fun PM So well done with the management I felt well managed ID Oh thanks UI I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings ID Its kinda fun ID Mm ME Sorry UI And I I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided PM That happened to me all the time though ID Mmhmm UI But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings so that we we knew where to go on from there PM Yeah I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we werent getting we didnt really have enough information to make firm decisions but we were able to do it regardless so ID Mmhmm PM Im not usually a very decisive person so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes ID This is what well do UI Yeah ID I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings UI Yeah for some of the meetings yeah PM Especially last time yeah ID Mmhmm ID Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information but at the same time not quite enough you know what I mean like we we couldnt answer every single question PM Yeah Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Right ID Um but Mm PM And I I felt the first two meetings that I was coming in with no information and not sort of made me really like ooh I dont know throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite PM I had so much information and so much to talk about ID It was interesting what came out like later like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even PM Yeah PM Mm ID Um ID Im a little I am a little disappointed that we didnt do a um something for losing the remote because that was kind of a big point PM Yeah PM that was something like in order to talk about that we wouldve had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like Yeah ID About yeah ME Well the problem was even when we just were creating from the Excel file there wasnt like a option to select to somehow have it included so there was no we could be like yeah it has it included UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM I think we were Yeah ID Mmhmm ME There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there ID Considered the re yeah PM I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task ID Well its interesting that they Mmhmm yeah PM I think we really got into it I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like ooh Im designing a remote control I dunno if thats just me but Yeah ID It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didnt provide us with information to um we werent provided with information to discuss that ME Yeah ID I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and itll beep but I but Im sure that would require some kind of technology that I just dont know what it is but Mm PM Yeah UI Yeah PM I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you wont lose them PM I dunno PM I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least theres only about two places that the remote is ever cause theres only one TV and theres only like three chairs ID Hmm ME Thats like saying youre never gonna lose your keys and I always do anyway ME Youll lose em in your pocket like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember theres always ways to lose things ID Mmhmm ID Mm PM Yeah ID It d yeah it depends on how organised you are personally but Mmhmm PM Yeah or like I guess what the setup of the house is too PM But I mean I am notorious for losing my keys I just I guess Ive just never lost the remote PM I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldnt find them PM Cause I was putting groceries away ME Thats funny ID Oh PM You youre taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room ID Cant get in PM Cant get in look all around the kitchen PM Definitely in the vegetable drawer ME Thats funny PM So ME I always do that leaving it in my coat and then like using a different coat PM Mm ID Yep PM But I guess its cause we dont carry remotes around that much ME Yeah ME Cant really take it into the other room PM Yeah PM Maybe with our little robot one we couldve had him have a robot alien pear whatever he is have a little voice like I am located Oh a GPS system internal GPS ME Oh man ME Here you go PM Although if its sitting still for too long ID We should make one that walks by itself PM Yes I Or little Or just just a wheel you know ME That really could get up and walk away ID Or or like some crazy like electromagnet that you push it and itll go zoom to the TV and stick there PM Just if you like youd have a remote for your remote thatll UI Yeah ID Well but if you could attach them to the TV then you can PM zoom Yeah PM Hmm PM All kinds of possibilities ID Mm ID Okay ID Sorry Im just um trying to update my minutes ID I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary rather than like repeating them PM Yeah ID Just gonna make Im making full minutes so that itll include all of the agenda and all that PM Oh PM Wow ID Cause that seems a little more useful PM Cause youve had like the most typing and organising to do ID But I didnt have like information to sloth through either so Most of it mmhmm PM Yeah I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you every meeting ID I added slides um I added a couple slides each time but that was about it PM Oh PM Okay PM Yeah I didnt even think about adding slides cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didnt even think about adding more ID Mm ID Well the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points but it wouldnt have a slide for each point PM Ah yeah ID And thats the only way I remember that I need to go other that point ID I know personally when I do PowerPoint thats what I do and so I had it once even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations and I would do your three PM Right ME You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like Okay good ID The slogan on it PM No no definitely not ID No no no PM We No I dont think we need to I think the R and R especially if the yellow and black one ME Cause I was like it could go around the outside ID I think we just need the um the RR yeah ME Is it yellow and blue PM Or yellow and blue PM Lemme go to the web page ID Yeah I was just kinda going by the web page cause they didnt give me any clear like yellow grey or ME Oh I guess it is black grey ME Grey is better than black doesnt look so bumblebeeish ID I dont really like yellow in general ME Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings ID But it Wasnt it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um the marketing choices you know like that was a bit of a conflict PM Finish meeting now ME Yes ME I will I just feel like if youre really doing like a a really big market evaluation you wouldnt just have like one set of source its kind of an they were so not backed up it would just be a sentence like we did a survey this is what people said PM Yeah ME S mm I dunno ID People are stupid PM I guess it i it sort of a grey isnt it PM Yellow and grey but then the slogans in blue ME Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons were good PM Yeah PM Well we dont have the right colour clay anyway ID Maybe like I dont know ID That could always be PM Well were not sadly going to actually be producing this so ID Oh ME If they ever come out with potato Im gonna have to Yeah PM Potato mango shaped remotes ID Im claiming it intellectual property PM I cant believe a whole day is gone ME I know PM I dont feel like its been that long PM Get sucked in PM Mm I havent gotten questionnaire eight yet,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned."
ME Are you sure I got it all heads kinda small UI Howre we placed in terms of the alright ME Okay ME Were okay PM Guess I should probably try to sit up straight ID Like that ID Okay cool ME Were good PM Oh I think mines fallen off UI It fell Thats why ME I guess its gonna be hard to drink coffee ME Mm ME Uh okay UI Ah ID Okay ID Right so Im just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick PM Wow ID Yeah PowerPoint ME Very official ID Yeah well you know ID Yeah I kinda like this Im kinda getting into it ID Right ID Um ID So just to kick off the meeting basically um so were working now for a real reaction this is uh so it right ID Just got an agenda to set out what were gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting ID Um Were gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then were gonna start talk a little bit about tool training ID Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we havent tried out yet the whiteboard ID Um weve got a general plan for the project how were gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up ID Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to Im just gonna you got of course you can discuss that Im thinking about um uh proposing that since weve got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just dont ask dont tell ID Um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um y is Exactly ME Youre just gonna believe me well go from there ME Fair enough ID Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesnt like if Im like were gonna sell a remote control thats the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesnt seem like such a good idea because of X obviously go with it ID I mean well discuss it but Im not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so cause were what were sort of role playing is y g yeah youre gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um ME Prove it yeah okay ID And thats the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i youre like in Maine you went to UCSB but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that why not you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it ID So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical PM Oh yeah thats fine UI Sure ME Works for me ID Sweet ID Cool ID So I guess that that were totally were making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website PM Right ID Um weve got to make something as fashionable as possible thats kind of the corporate strategy is were gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenhams or something ID So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way ID Um way were gonna go about doing that is basically at first were gonna start on the basics ID And thats where Im gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I cant remember the the ID and the UID right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project cause youre gonna be youre g you guys are the bottom you know youre like no you cant do that you cant have you know X and Y um at the same time UI Mm ME There you go ID And then um well work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but its also better if its not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand or something like that ID Um and so well work up from there and um then well meet on and talk about it and then finally well incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us whats possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the UID and the ID you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up ID So thats the detailed design ID So its a three stage kind of thing ID Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it I havent tried it yet either um Im just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down Im just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five CDs along with you name one of them that you could not all five if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um ID

Cafe Forte Cool ID Yes ID On university yeah ID Yeah its actually like literally half a mile from my house ID Yeah pretty cool ID Small world as we were discussing before PM Yeah ID Especially when were all from the same general region ID Right so okay success on the whiteboard ME There you go ID You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city you know I think well Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance PM Wow ID Um basically what were trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros ID Um ID This is what the finance department has told me the CFO but I dont know Im not sold on this its pretty dear I mean twenty f thats like you know forty bucks for a remote ID It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me ME Mm ID Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but were gonna make a lot on it the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it ID Eur internationally ID So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably PM Okay ID Um so something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if its gonna control DVDs but um you know Ill leave that to you guys but thats something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing ME Makes sense ME Uh ID Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty ID So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can ID Um s right so um just to close up Im not sure how much time Ive used mm next time right Project Manager sorted ID Um ID Is uh well meet in another half an hour or so um and Id like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it ID Um UID well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and youll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do ID Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the users gonna want ME What theyre looking for ID So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the users gonna want and what the user can have you know like uh so yeah well it is and well discuss the tradeoffs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email ME And negotiate that ME Uh ID But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up well have meetings and youll get emails and so forth ID Um any questions before we get started UI I assume that were building a stand alone uh remote control we cant kind of build it into other uh products ID You mean to like Hmm UI For instance like a mobile phone or something like that PM Mm PM Sounds interesting ID Yeah ME I dont think theres any rules about it yet ME So Yeah PM Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that UI Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ID Well have a think about it ME Mm ID I mean Im Im certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like its certainly doable isnt it UI Yep UI Okay ME W yeah ID I mean um or if we cant have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID The clapper ID No I mean no good idea good idea ID Well see what see what Uhhuh y I like that Yeah PM Maybe a remote with changeable faces like the faces that you can buy for phones ME I like the little cover thingies UI Nice PM Yeah UI Hot ID Thats true I guess we we probably have some time maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do go back to um I dont really have any ID Let me bring up something about our basic goals here what we want to accomplish ID Uh project announcement ID Ts ts ts Yeah ID Not so much ME Hmm ID All right well find them were on our own UI Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ID Yeah yeah lets do it lets do UI S does anybody have any initial ideas ID Im gonna go ahead and take notes on this too cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right ME Good idea ME Start your minutes ME Um Well its pretty much given its gonna be universal right we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing but then Ive never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you cant tell what they do ID So initial ideas ID Yeah PM Yeah PM S smallers better ID Mmhmm PM Simple ME Yeah UI But Im thinking Im thinking kind of PDA uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things ME Specific ME Okay PM Oh right PM Thatd be different ME Interesting ID Yeah thats slick isnt it ID I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah ME True ID Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this perfect ID Um so weve got this kind of an idea of a tradeoff between um uh size and functionality ME Mm ME Mm ID Um and we also Im also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L like a touch screen type of remote ME Right ME We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much youre not gonna be able to tell them apart that whole yeah PM Yeah UI Too confusing PM Its gonna be too complicated too crowded with buttons and things ME Hmm UI Mmhmm ME Mm UI Possibly ID I dont think one exists ME An interesting option ID Be a good idea PM Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes ME Yeah ME Definitely ID Yeah all the other universal remotes ID Um I dont know if theres such a thing out there I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multiformat like um you know PAL NTSC region one Okay ME Right UI Im pretty sure there is UI I mean I I have a friend who has a PDA that he just points at his telev any television he wants and itll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world ID Okay ME That Yeah ID Interesting ME Awesome ID Okay ME Yeah ID Okay ID Okay ID Um all right ID So ID I li Im liking that idea this idea of a touch screen remote with multiformat features ME Mmhmm ID Um PM Right ID Um ID Lets see PM I think making it out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remotes that you see these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality ME Yeah ID Mm ME Yeah ME Keeping it nice and slick would be important ME And I dont know like theres such a problem with losing them that adding this whole like PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose so were gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool PM Mm UI Oh ID Uh lets see ID Um UI I like the idea of the uh multi plate ID Yeah yeah okay ME Yeah ME Fi b like what are they called those face plate things UI In in I like ME Isnt there a name for them ID Think theyre just called face plates ME Are they ID I dont know PM something uh well have to come up with a name patent it ME I dunno UI We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well ME Yeah ME Something really cool UI For those cold winter days ME Leopard print or something PM Leopard print ID Um ME Hmm PM I think it wouldnt be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote ME True ID Mm ID But if were bundling it unless were selling their telly with the remote ME Right PM Mm ID Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page UI Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it PM True UI If youre not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but thats a little bit annoying ME True ME Right ID Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones you have a page button and it goes could we do something like that UI Th Yeah ME Right PM Yeah ME Right UI Thats cool PM I think so ME Probably UI I think we could design into that PM Yeah ME Good ID Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple s been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah ME Mm ME Yeah ME And that titanium the new silver sleek ones thats last couple of years very much so PM Mm UI Curves ME Mm ID Yeah ID We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know its pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price ME Right ID Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote thats black and you know m massive some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere ME Right PM Yeah ME Mm ME Definitely ID But um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how were gonna sell it and um Mm ME Yeah ME Or if you our users in mind like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new lets design no its theyre used to the buttons so well have to be careful of exactly who were marketing this to and who were gonna be able to get it out of PM Yeah PM S true ME But Euros UI Were talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ID Twenty five Euros UI Slight difference I guess ID Yeah ID Theyre all weaker than theyre all stronger than the Dollar ME Mm ID Although computer parts all if youre gonna upgrade your computer buy it in the States ID Like um do you guys know Frys ID Huge computer uh electronics store UI No ME Mmmm ID They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about ME Mm ID Right so um lets go ahead and wrap that up here for now Im gonna put these initial ideas that weve got in the um project documents so if you guys wa need a reminder about what weve talked about um the different you know kind of tradeoffs that weve got and the other ideas you can consult them at your leisure ME Okay PM Okay ID And uh right so thanks for that ID Lets just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into ME With half an hour ID Um ID Yes ME Kay ME Perfect ID Thanks guys ME Cool UI Thank you PM Alright,"The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new, fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant. The group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools. The Project Manager discussed the financial goals of the project, including the projected profit aim and price point for the device. The Project Manager gave each participant their assignments. The group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features. The Project Manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group's initial ideas about the device."
ID All set ID Okay ID Cool ID Right ID So um basically Im just gonna go over real quickly um some news Ive just got from the board on how were supposed to do with this um remote control ID And then Im gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what youve found and then well have a bit of discussion ID So basically uh what Ive just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only ID So no were not doing DVD were not doing anything else its just gonna be a television remote ME Okay ID Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it ID Um so thats red and black ID And it has to have the slogan case you guys forget the slogan its we put fashion in electronics ID Um and no teletext ID Im not sure what teletext is but Im assuming you guys do so we dont wanna include that um in this particular design ID For reasons that I dont really know ID Theres but its the board so there you go ID So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design well discuss it later I mean cause its television only well be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote ID Anyway ID So Im gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on Oh right yeah PM Okay PM So do I unplug this bit here ME Gotta plug you in ID Yep ID Might have to hit function F eight but it looks like its gonna come up ID Yep ID Cool PM Okay PM Right PM Thats page one of my presentation ID Brilliant ME Very nice ME For your first PowerPoint its lovely PM So the uh method PM Were gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project PM Um remote control works as follows PM This is all pretty basic stuff you guys PM Um sends message to another system so theres an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power something along those lines theres an integrated circuit which is the microchip um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system PM A user interface controls the chip basically thats the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well PM So my findings um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands PM And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals PM Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like and theres also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer just think of those lawsuits thatd be really bad PM Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction ID Kay PM Um components PM Just some ideas that I had um energy source its kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup PM Um the user interface I was since we cant use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic ID Mm PM The chip um silicon based chip I dont really see any way around that we cant really be different in that respect PM Um the sender well Im thinking infrared cause it is the industry standard multi channel thats a word I made up I dont really know what it means ID Kay PM Uh PAL and NTSC compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range ID Fair enough ID Kay PM Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices PM Um but in this case itll only be TVs PM Um personal preferences I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal um the company simply cant afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value cause we were thinking Right ME Fine ID Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ME It needs yeah PM Yeah that shouldnt be a problem PM Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something thats perfectly possible for us to do ID Okay okay ME Cool PM Thats the end of my presentation ID Great ID Thank you very much Nathan ID Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation thatd be great as well ID S plug yourself in here ID Mm ID Um hit function F eight real quickly hold down Mm ME Looks like youre in okay PM Is it plugged in well PM There it goes PM Computer adjusting UI Th Well so ME There you go ID There you go ID Sweet UI Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation UI Um so a few of the requirements we need here UI Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that thats no problem ID Yeah sorry I couldnt get that g to use before UI Um so some of my findings UI Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set UI Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television uh switch to the next channel that sort of thing I think were all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does UI Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we cant quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they wont use most of the functions because they dont know how to use them and dont wanna take the time to learn how to do it ID Oh yeah look at that PM Mm ID Mmhmm UI As you also notice its quite a boring design UI Um UI Another remote control slightly different its a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use UI Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and its also quite boring UI So my personal preferences UI Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control ID Nice UI Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with UI And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didnt quite have time there UI Um ID Okay UI Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but its uh ID Great ID Thanks for that Ron ME Right ME Does that mean Im up ID Kay yep thats you ME I think so ME Okay UI I can plug you in ME Oh that would be perfect ME Thank you ME Slide show up and running ME Or not ID Give it a little bit ME Uh ME Oh there we go ME Perfect ME Okay ME So this is me ME Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that weve got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use TV remotes and see what it is that theyre using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they dont about their general TV remote control practices ME Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time everybodys used to using changing the channel turning it on using the volume m the majority of the time thats all thats going on the other functions happen for some people theyre important but the primary uses are really really basic ME Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general publics use theyre not using a lot of it they dont need it they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they dont know what to do with ME And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it ME And then they cant find it in the room ME So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something will really come into play with a lot of these people ME Um theres also a survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they all think theyre hideous and not very useful and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options ME I dont know if thats something were ready to look into technically thats up to the design people but it is s something worth thinking about especially since the younger demographics obviously the one thats gonna keep growing so if thats the direction were headed in its something to think about ME Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice which are the standards ME So its a good start for us ID Thats great ID Thank you Sarah ID Right ME Need to unplug this ID So um yep Ill just uh switch that back here ME Need it back ID Ill finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase ME There you go ID Right so I think weve covered most of these important questions through this um through you guyss presentations um weve got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic ID Um Sarah shes recommended that we go for simpler functions so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted thought about voice control um so do we wanna go for that or do we want to go for an older demographic and my thought is um weve got w if were gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um ME Oh right ME Were not catering to the pensioners of the world I dont think so ID Yes ID So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic ID Um ME Right ID So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think were constrained to plastics very well weve got this idea Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way its looking um which might be easier given that were going for simpler function and that were only going for a telly ME Right ME Uh ID Um so um ID How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that its doable um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see ME Right PM Mm ID Okay you cant say record alias tonight at seven PM but we might be able to say um volume up ME Yeah PM Right PM I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology ID Mm ME Oh ME That could work ME I like that PM With a simple command like locate ME Yeah PM And then it could start to beep and therefore be found ME Something very basic ME Right ID Right UI Sounds good ME Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then PM Oh yeah I think thats very doable ME Okay ID The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldnt speak into the remote that youre trying to find ID Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If its hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know thats just a little chip or whatever that has the page button maybe that could be voice activated too PM Mm ME Yeah PM Its a good point UI A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television ME Mm UI And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME K Yeah ID Or an isolated magnet or something like or you know something that wouldnt interfere I dont know thatd be the technical thing but yeah I like that I like that the voice recognition for the paging system UI So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market ME True UI And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not ME Making it just an option PM Mm ME Yeah ME Right PM I was thinking uh Oh go ahead ID Yeah ME Are we still thinking about this screen sorry ME Go ahead ME The uh if were gonna do this touch pad screen thing it would be still do we know if thats an option technically right now to that ID Mmhmm UI S definitely an option technically ME Okay UI Ive looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point ME Okay ME Were doing okay ME Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings things that youre not gonna use every day and that a lot of people arent gonna use but it is an option there for this hitech market that sort of re is the sleek thing were going for ID Okay ID Mm PM Yeah PM Gotta wonder though if were adding so much technology to this one remote are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things ID Mmhmm ME True ME Worth looking into ID Mmhmm PM It seems like were not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip ME Yeah ID Mmhmm PM The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism ME True ID Okay ME Yeah PM So its just something to consider ID Okay ID Absolutely ID Mm kay um well yeah I guess well cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know thats perfectly viable question ID Mm kay um so Im seeing that were gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group aim it at them but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically well make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control ME Mmhmm ID Um I think this voice recognition thing is a weve got a market for it uh I dont think theres too many wed more or less be cornering the market on it as well we dont have many um ME Mm ME Yeah ID I appear to have lost my microphone ID Mm ID Right um we dont have many people or theres not very many competitors out there that do that so cool ID Um right ID I guess weve c weve touched on most of this ID The idea of a paging function a touch screen and face plates ID Um ID The thing with I see would there not be a wed have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen UI Um Im not sure thats sincerely correct I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable ID Okay ME Mm ID Okay ME Just the casing UI We could have the casing the the face plates ID Okay PM Back to the uh the cost the material PM We have to ask whether were going to include a certain number of face plates with the package PM Thats something I w for say were including three or four face plates its gonna drive the cost up ME Mm ID Mm PM And the other question is if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ME Yeah PM We havent done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if theres even interest out there ME Right ID Okay ID Okay ID Right PM Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldnt really go anywhere ID Yeah cause then ha you would have to who all its not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X and then ten people make face plates for it wed be just our model of pho of t remote control ME Mm ME Right PM Yeah ME Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around it is sort of emblematic whereas youre just sit at home so unless somebody comes over to watch TV True ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room ME True ME True UI Uh ID Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth um ME Yeah ME Oh yeah UI Sure ID True if plastic is dead cheap and if were making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah well cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate whats most important ID Um I think weve had a bit of discussion already on this thing n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations UI Well have we confirmed that were gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface ID Yeah yeah okay ID Um Yeah I think that would be best ID Lets based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me lets go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased cause tha tha thats easy on the cost try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think thats a great idea ID With a touch screen for the basic functions ID Um And well yeah tha lets provisionally lets go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen ID Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls ID Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost ME True ME Cause it would have a docking base ID Mmhmm ID But then again that costs as well ME Yeah ID Hmm UI So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ID Do they UI Those new ones ID Okay ME Can we afford that PM Can we afford to include one of those ME And will somebody buy it if we dont ID Well I I dont think yeah I cant see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so wed have to see some kind of new battery technology ME Right ID Okay so lets go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well its its worth looking into if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know ME For twelve Euros ME It is ME Fair enough ME The basics ID Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w well do the aesthetics ME Mm ID Okay so well touch screen and the battery focus on um uh presentation ME Kay ID Um its th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off channels volume um and um a small paging function PM Right ID Even if you cant do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button thats just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging ID Just a beep PM Okay ID Um right so any comments ID Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this PM Since were doing uh touch screen do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that PM Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody UI Be interesting ME Mm PM What what would be on that touch screen PM Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto I cant remember exactly what you said ME And oh ME Yeah the the fashion do UI We put fashion into electronics ME Yeah ID W its my understanding that if you were going to do a skin youd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control ME Right and then youre dealing with ports and cords and Yeah ID Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a PDA would they would makes a lot of sense for a PDA cause youre gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno what do you guys think PM S too much ME For now PM Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen ME Yeah ME Nice PM Thatd be okay UI Yeah UI Uh I Im Im in agreement with that Im wondering how were gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device ME Um ME Well but if were gonna use a touch screen where its gonna come on like on your cell phone itll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while its loading and then it goes away perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then thats it cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think ID Hmm ID Mm PM Mm ID Yeah PM True ID Yeah UI Im hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on ME Yeah ME Y Yeah you would think ID Yeah ID Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the RR on there UI Mmhmm ID Jus But apparently not ME But ME If it comes from above PM People arent gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on ID So PM They just want it to be on and ready to go ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Well fair enough ID Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on ID But then again who wants to turn on a remote control UI Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on ID Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode ME Mm UI Yep UI Goes into a sleep mode ID Okay ID Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen nice ID Um ID Um cool so any last things before we break ID Alright ID Fair enough ME Were good ID Sounds good ID Im gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders ID Im gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that Ill do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference UI Ive put my files in the shared folder as well ID Brilliant ME Yeah ID Thats fab guys ID Cool,"The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo."
ME That went well thank you ID Thats great ME Perfect PM Kay ID Alright let me just PowerPoint this up ID Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design dont ask me s precisely what conceptual design is its just something important that we need to do ID Um think of it s kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete ID In this meeting ideally well come to some final decisions on what were gonna do for the prototype ID Um ID Right so um apologies for the last meeting it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough um so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting ID Um fair enough thanks for the input s always good ID Um ID So basically all were gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um and gonna go through you uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and well collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions ID And then well make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work ID So perfect ID So without th further ado whoever wants to go first is free to PM Ill go first ME Go ahead ID Alright Nathan take it away ID It is Nathan right ID Im not calling you the wrong name over and over again PM No Nathans fine ID Good PM Its either Nathan or participant two UI Mister participant two that is PM Uh ME Nice PM Okay ID Nice PM Um basically what Im gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and its been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers so Basically what Im gonna be doing is talking to you about that ID Mm PM Um components of a remote control okay PM Weve already kind of gone over this but were gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon PM Energy source um our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources your standard battery solar cells PM Our manufacturer didnt say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere PM Um and also theres a kinetic energy possibility PM Basically its like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running PM So thats one possibility but I dont know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen ID Hmm ME Mm PM So well have to look into that PM Um the case we have a few options plastic rubber or wood PM Um and then as far as the way its shaped we can do standard boring flat which we probably dont wanna do curved or very sexy double curved ID What kind of th thickness are we looking at PM Um I imagine that we could specify PM Um I dont see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres ID Okay brilliant PM Yeah PM Um the buttons there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer but to use those wed have to use more chips um and that would cost us more PM And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um well have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons arent compatible with that ID Hmm ME Right PM Um and just a little note there touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro ME Right ME Nice PM Um one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum PM So you notice when you push a button on a remote you cant see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that PM And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light PM Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote just kind of as a fun gimmick ID Hmm PM So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it ME Interesting PM Course itd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldnt damage the human eye or anything like that ME Mm ME Good call ID M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like Yeah I like the idea its a good idea ME Choose it PM Yeah PM I am sure that we could do that PM Um of course Yeah just as a fun gimmick ID Yeah PM Just to set us apart a little bit PM Um and then on to the circuit board that were gonna use also known as the chip PM Uh we really dont have any way around the TA one one eight three five PM Um findings okay were very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer um and my question to all of you is should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available UI Interesting question PM S a bit of a challenge question ID Mm ME Well Id say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a feasible option UI Yes ID Mm PM Right thats my concern too PM Um if we do go the lithium battery route then well have to go outside our current manufacturer PM My personal preference is Ill just throw my cards on the table uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on PM Uh I like the idea of the visible light signalling thats something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes PM So were not so confined by one style and say some you know say our the one if we just go with one and it doesnt go over well then were in a bad situation ME Right ID Mm ME Right ID Can we do marketing piloting too ID Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how theyre received ME Um Its an option uh but actually theres Ive got some research already on like what were looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand it may help us decide for now ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay perfect ID Great thank you very much Nathan ME Temporarily anyway PM Oh yeah youre welcome ID Thats perfect so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here ME I guess so cause I found some interesting things ME You waiting for me ID Fascinating compelling even UI Did you ME I know what a teaser aint it ME Um ME Right ME So current market trends ME Screen ME Um basically I was looking at whats going on in the remote control market right now and whats going on in other design fields to see sort of whats whats trendy whats new whats happening ME Um remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting theyre sick of this boring normal functional um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface ME Um the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture in technology is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing ME Now Im not saying we should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean v line thing may be something we can look into PM Mm ME Different skin options or if we cant afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface um maybe having the b images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape or okay not the example I would choose but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy uh not something I Ive come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like um leather options or wood options or something Mmhmm ID Tomatoes PM Mm UI I like it I like it PM Hmm PM I should have mentioned this um PM As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those stress balls UI Yes ME Mm ME Might be an interesting way to go UI Fabulous ID Slick slick ME Um yeah so something to sit on for now ME So overall I think we should stick with what were finding everyones looking for easy to use technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now PM Mm ME Um ID Interface oh the interface graphics for the um Yeah ME Yeah ME Um ME Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isnt gonna work out for us thats really a nonissue PM I like the idea of of rubber too because its tends to be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesnt matter ID Mm ME True PM Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls ME Very true ID Yeah its like yep its ubiquitous isnt it ME Very true PM Taped with duck tape and what have you you wouldnt have that problem if you used rubber ME Very much so ME Um We could UI We can have a duck tape casing ME I think that goes against the whole fancy something a new line but worth a shot UI It could go with the granola crowd ME Ah it could be it could be um ME Yeah thats what I know ID Great thanks for that Sarah ME No problem ID Ron UI Phew UI Computers adjusting UI One moment please UI So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer UI So yur user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear or otherwise uh perceive UI Uh commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operator operating system UI Heres a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today UI I think were definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look ID Yeah UI Um so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts UI Uh voice recognition we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh Ill get to that in a moment UI Um so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control UI Now our design team research team has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses UI Like you could say good morning uh remote control and itll say in a sexy female voice Good morning Joe UI Um UI In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control right ME Mm ID Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the Mm ME Yeah ME Very true very true UI Um another concept is what uh Apple has come up with the spinning wheel with uh LC display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about ME Mm UI Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated pushbutton kind of like a modern a bit bulky a bit crazy I dont think thats were necessarily going for ID Mm PM Mm PM No UI And uh some special components uh ideas like uh blocking having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I dont think thats a big issue UI Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here ME Hmm UI Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose ID Yeah I can see UI Um again probably not what were going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think were heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions weve come up with are definitely uh very good ideas ME Okay UI Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line ME Mm right UI Uh touch screen interface um possibly having goto buttons being uh stuck into the system so those dont move away from the screen uh the important ones like power volume and jump between channels UI Um and of course our voice command system which Ive talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not ID Mm ME Mm UI And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when its ready ME Nice ID Great UI And uh that is about it ID Great wonderful Ron cool ID Lot of good ideas good facts to have ME Mm ID Thats what they need its like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you dont have to stand up every time just connect it my kingdom PM Yeah ME Mm ID Right so good to know all that stuff thanks guys um ID Now we kind of have to come to some decisions um I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it ID Um ID Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think I dunno what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ME I think its our most marketable feature just because its so new and its something that is showing up in other places ID Kay ID Kay ME But can we really afford it cause it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right ID Mmhmm PM My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology its gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote yeah thats just an estimate though ID To produce each one ME Per ME Piece UI Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects ME I know And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ID Mm UI You industrial designers PM I know PM Its fun ID Hmm ID Well ME Do we remember PM I thought there was some flexibility with that ME Okay ID There is its just it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean were gonna have to increase the price to make money ME Can we justify it ID Um from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five ID If you multiply seventeen fifty by two thats thirty five ME Right ID So From the board um well Thats true I mean And thats to be fair the um the per cent of the market were not going for mass any you know mass sales anyway were gonna make I mean we were not talking about selling eight zillion of these things we just couldnt not for twentyfive Euros so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five sell em for thirty but thats something that we can have finance deal with UI Where do you guys come up with these numbers PM Thats just off the top of my head it is pending further emails PM Right ME Though I think thats what people would pay for I mean if youre gonna pay for an expensive high class remote youre gonna expect it to do something Yeah PM It is the new it would be in a class of its own ME Right ME Yeah ID Um I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron UI Im thinking thats uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh Yeah ME See if we can cut some corners ME Right ME Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option and maybe we can get em somewhere else cheaper ID Mm PM Its true PM We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on Yeah ME Right ME Its a starting point anyway so ID No we could have a s very simple touch screen you know theres always the opportunity if its gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever you know w we yeah I guess we can play around with it a bit ID Alright lets lets say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here ME Mm UI I mean I think that we really have two main selling points I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest we have the capa we have the design inhouse I mean weve weve come up with this with this new voice were using it for our coffee machines already ID So The voice rec thing I mean if if were looking at bottom line now were looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on I think we might have to drop the voice rec ME Yeah cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote ME I think wed have to decide between em definitely ID Yeah ME Pricewise ME True ME Weve already got it UI I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall UI Sounds good ID Hmm ID What do you think on it Nathan ID About the voice rec PM I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into itd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically ME Pretty much PM It would be very nice UI I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say ME Right and they said they wanted voice recognition ME Course maybe they hadnt thought of this whole touch screen option but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and were not gonna use it even though we know itll sell is a call I dont think I can give the highs ups ID Mm ME Like really I cant go in and say no were gonna just ignore everything we know ID Yeah UI Does having both really up our costs ID I cant see how it wouldnt I mean theres you know the old aphorism you can have it fast you can have it cheap or you can have it quality pick two of three ID You know you cant you cant have all three ME Yeah PM Yeah cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function ID Its just impossible ME Yeah ID Well if were gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two ID Um ID Otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive ID What which which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ME Well we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent ME But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if thats whats gonna sell I think thats what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model PM I would have to side with that I think the voice recognition is simpler we already have the all the technology inhouse its ready to go its packaged its Um this is just off the top of my head keep in mind but I think the voice recognition would theyre both mm theyre both gonna push the costs up but um since we already have the technology inhouse for the voice recognition were not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up if you know what I mean ID Kay ID What does the cost look like Ron ID Is it cheaper to do the VR or to do the uh touch screen ID Nathan UI Well my p is Um I definitely have to agree with that last comment ME Mm ID Mm ME Right ID Right ME Right ME And were still not then we dont have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what weve already got ID Mm ME In a lot other ways too ID Okay ID So Im getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of em the voice recognition will be better ID Okay ME I think its our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option ID Yeah ID Okay ID Sorted ID We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition UI Its you and me outside a little here ME So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next thats you guyss next step right ID Yeah well well well sic well sort out what it what f what else were gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah thats our next step itll be a developing of prototype PM Yeah ME Right ME Okay PM Are we going to talk now about um the materials that were gonna use for the case and all those things ID Yes ME Mmhmm ID Well just run through it yeah yeah um PM Okay ID You discussed either a lithium or a solar power ID Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ID Or this kinesthetic one would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control PM Um the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed cause sometimes solar power fails and theres no way round that we should install a small backup battery ID Mm ME Yeah PM Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason the remote hasnt been exposed to Its true ME Well what of people with like the TV in their basement like what if wha we cant guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably Yeah ID Mm ID Yep PM Yeah it works about the same as a solar powered calculator and you know how those those dont really require that much light um but obviously a little more light than a calculator but were not talking about a lot of light UI Calculator ME True ME True PM Doesnt have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything ME Right ID Right ME Okay ID Okay ID What do you think Ron UI Im willing to agree with everything thats been said ID Okay UI Uh I have to say though that um another ideas come up in my head UI If were really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something ME Uh Interesting ID Hmm PM Hmm PM Why why moving away from handheld why UI Just a thought ID Yeah PM Whats the uh idea UI Well if you dont need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point ME I if its got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job PM Hmm PM Do you think people that are people that buy a remote are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes ME True and i probabl I think were banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too right ID Well we have to have buttons on it too as well ID But thats done thats no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th subwoofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers ME Mmhmm PM Right ME Yep ME Yeah ID I mean why not have a little rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it ID Um cause were going for basic functionality primarily as well ME With the bu yeah ID And maybe a menu button and so forth you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out PM I think I think youre on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote ME Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good even though and handheld the same time ME True ME Way to go UI I think its all about following Apples lead on a lot of these things ME Yeah Im thinking of the airport portal you know like that little pod looking thing UI Mmhmm ID Mm PM Yeah those are nice UI Exactly ID Yeah I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is Im recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Still I mean yeah along those lines ME Right PM Mm ME That would be kinda neat ME Terracotta bowl or something ME Mm ID Yeah I like that I like that idea a lot ID Um lets see what we can do as far as that goes PM Okay ID And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen its a bit gives just a bit ME Mm ME Yeah ID You know something where its uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it PM Right PM Just kind of the squishy feel ME Yeah which is the next big thing so thats not gonna hurt us either ID Mm kay ID Yeah lets see if we can do a squishy nonremote controllooking remote control ID But to be fair yeah I mean you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up ME Right ID Yeah I like it I like the idea thats good ME Handy ID Um and weve sorted of discussed costs um ID I guess well a thats gonna be uh a thing if we run a bit overbudget that might be okay um PM Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost I just havent been provided that information by our manufacturers and Im just having to guess ME Okay ID Well have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a well have more of an idea later on ID Um ID And we just yeah go from there ID Um so weve revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out um I think so were more or less con we wh wh were more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function you know not too complex ME Mm ME Right ME Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis although Im not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary at least if not functionally then visually like those shouldnt be Take precedence yeah PM Right ID Like maybe have menu things PM If if were not going the touchscreen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things ME Right ID Mm ME And they slide ID Yes ME Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isnt a touch screen but youre still scrolling through menu options in p True were still not making it easier then UI Think then were hitting our cost issue again ID Yeah weve also got the the me the thing of if were gonna have a nonremotelooking remote how do we yeah PM Yeah ME True ME Fair enough ID B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment you know like if it say its a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing itd be easy to have a compartment in there ME Yeah ID Or you know a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing like on um like on a DVD player ID You know you see the modern DVD playersll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that ME Mmhmm ME Yeah its just a scroll PM Right ME Yeah PM So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons were going to use are we going to use scroll buttons PM Rubber buttons PM Um Right ID Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber cause since were probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um ME Yeah ME Probably UI I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command ME Right ME Mm ME Well no its basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it are really versatile and everybodys already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so its not like were dealing with everybody relearning things cause thats not something anybodys gonna wanna buy a new for PM Right ID Mm kay um ID Weve already kind of covered this as well ID That seems to be selling um and we weve more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market um ME Mm ID Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population ME Right particularly in technological fields so thats exactly where were headed ID Mmhmm mmhmm ID Okay ID Um ID Yeah alright well more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype UI Well what are we actually doing UI What were Sure ID Right ID I was just gonna step on to um I wasnt ME Uh ME Oh it wasnt in the way but yeah whatever ID Oh my bad um sorry ME No dont worry about it ID The um yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool ME Okay PM So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ME Yeah PM Or are we just going to go with one ID Um PM Its very its very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously but if you have just one case and it doesnt go very well mm ME Yeah ID Yeah ME Right PM Its a tough situation but obviously having more cases also costs more so Theres an idea ID Well then again colours wouldnt be so hard to do you could have uh a you know a um uh kind of a natural wood colour like a stained wood and um I dont know olive green or something ME Mm ME Yeah ID That wouldnt be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing UI And again copying iMacs kind of for iPod Mac Apples uh colour scheme ME Yeah get in there ME Yeah totally ID Yeah I think thats probably a good id okay so lets work on uh multiple case colours ID But yeah stick with the same kind of kinda yeah the same basic nonremote kind of remote design ID Cool ID Alright so well have the next meeting about half an hour um ID I want the uh Id like Nathan Id like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish um given these parameters that were just gonna sort of have this kind of uh nonremote remote ID Um what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype PM Right ID And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple ID Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place ID Um and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff ID Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype um using um prototype building materials um ID And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well PM Oh excellent yeah ID So thats what to start with for now is that alright you guys feel clear about this ME Cool PM That sounds good UI Fabulous ID Alright ID I guess well just hit the bricks ID Thanks guys ME Cool,"The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface. The group then discussed the features of the device. They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. They decided to use solar power to power the device. The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. They discussed using rubber for the case. The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes. The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market, and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype."
ME Okay ME Oh I totally Yeah cause I moved it ME S put it over here ME Then we dont have to worry about it UI Ready for this ID All set ID Cool ID Alright it is PowerPoint time ID Ive done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than Ive ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun PM Yeah UI Oh man ID So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me ID It means Im supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting PM Oh really PM Okay ID I think ME Huh ID I dont know ID Otherwise its just saying Im the secretary and Im therefore Im taking the minutes s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting uh I will open them slowly no ID Wait for it wait for it ME Yeah thats not you ID No ID Thats how the Wait ID This is this is very highpowered stuff here doubleclicking there we go ID So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer uh or from Nathan and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations were operating with um uh excuse me what limitations were operating under what kind of risk wed be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition IE that had a vaguely nonremote like shape um because you didnt really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice ID That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a foldout bay for more advanced functions for users ID Um and uh the uh uh the UID and the ID were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at ID So ID Thats sorted back to the main meet here um go ahead and take it away guys PM Well PM Uh we have assembled our prototype um PM Whats to be said about it PM Um we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting um PM Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions um ID Mmhmm PM This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons PM And then for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on PM But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when its all put away um PM As far as the uh whole visible light thing we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out why not ME Ah ID Nice ME Fair enough PM Of course if thats annoying for some people that function can be turned off ID Perfect PM Um UI No its important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what weve done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will PM Go ahead ME Mm ME Right ME Appropriate okay UI Um UI Right um of course thats uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there ME Mm kay ME It is an option ID Oh right PM Thats this here ME Ah UI Um ME I see UI So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption UI Um what other things do we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel um so I think that will work well with regards to our market UI Um and uh lets see well clearly theres gonna be some more colours and what not available UI Um uh do you have anything else to add to that PM Um I worried about the materials it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so its very durable uh its not gonna break like some types of plastic thats dropped PM Um and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel UI Its actually important to note that the television uh you know if theres an earthquake or anything like that that i it actually is edible inside PM Fact I dunno if you noticed but I wrote the uh the companys name on the telephone screen I thought that was kinda nice ID Oh well done yeah yeah oh ok Edible televisions its a wave of the future ME Nice PM This was actually an apple on the inside ME Do we need to worry about um rot factors PM This Yeah UI Um its encased in a new uh type of uh polymer yeah ME Oh okay theres preservatives involved we dont need to worry okay UI Its fine PM We got a bit ahead of ourselves I know were not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that but Right UI Hmm ME Fair enough ME No but Its a couple years off at least UI Its pos a possible new product ME Okay UI Um but I think thats I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature ID Brilliant UI Um did we come in under budget PM Uh we did yeah PM This cost well to put this into um production were looking at about what was our goal PM It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine PM Um so I was quite pleased with that UI Mmhmm PM One thing that we didnt do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didnt have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and thats what helped keep the cost down ME Mm ID Brilliant PM So even though it has a lot of modern technology um for example the voice recognition in a lot of ways its just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper ME Mm ME Okay UI Mm UI Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option PM And Oh no we havent talked about that yet have we UI So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think its nicely designed into the into the overall look ME Okay ME Yeah UI Um but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with UI Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not ME Mm kay PM Hmm PM Yeah UI And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um so ME Right ID Cool PM Any questions ID No no I think thats Right yeah thanks guys thats very very good work ME Do we have um other for lack of a better word skins ME Covers ME In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or PM Um do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ME Do we know where we stand on that yet UI Well we didnt quite have enough material uh ME Oh I wasnt expecting a prototype I just didnt know if you guys had any in mind yet PM Yeah yeah UI Oh I see right um PM Um well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um itd be very easy to put another layer of something else like Its not its not quite a a face plate its more like a pseudoface plate because its simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it it locks into place such that you know its pretty permanent but at the same time if we wanna go the other way its just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean ME Okay ME Just veneer really yeah UI Right ME Okay UI Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that ME Mmhmm ME And the whole thing Okay ME Right UI So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier nonnatural look um materials which I think worked out fine ME Yeah ME Theres Okay UI We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apples colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green ME Mm kay ME Okay very cool ME Okay ME Okay ME Yep ME Its still an option if we need it PM Yeah ME Very cool nice job ID I like it brilliant ID Um what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um I got me youve got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice ID Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance PM Oh ID Um its a spreadsheet of the parts and Ive just tentatively put in what its going to look like um PM Ooh ID Im just gonna clear this out real quickly but it looks like So well just if we can just itemize whats in here weve got this its a solar cell thing right PM Right uh we didnt really touch on that but it its in there yep ID With a backup battery ID With the ba okay ID Um and Clever clever well done UI The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area UI Yeah ID Um so I guess that would mean weve got a bit of a um Its a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isnt it PM Yeah yeah PM Its just making use of the same space and the same materials but Yeah one big curve I guess you could say ME Mmhmm ID Okay ID Um and the case its more of a singlecurved case I guess would be that be the general Um and weve got a rubber skin material basically throughout ME Mmhmm ID Um ID Push button interface um with this other dropdown so maybe weve got two push button interfaces dont we PM Yeah mmhmm ID Um ID And um a special I guess its uh weve got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout yeah PM Yeah special PM And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well dont you PM Cause it i it is very unconventional I like to think of it as unconventional ID Yeah its its quite unique ID I like it yeah its So it looks like a bit over budget um ME M come in at sixteen PM Oh PM Huh doesnt match up does it ID So what we could do perhaps a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the backup battery PM How do you feel about that ID Uh Mmhmm UI I mean I think that uh if were talking about it being one of our main selling features being environmental and without the batteries and what not although it does still have a battery so Im not sure that you know what the sell is on that ME Yeah PM I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and itd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but youre gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isnt working what am I gonna do ME Mm k ID Mmhmm PM Peopled be real upset PM I think in the longrun its better to keep the battery its hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea cause thats so integral to the theme that we have ME True ID Hmm ID Whats difficult we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just cant back out of now it would have to be seems like wed have to go back to square one in a way ME Nah ID Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit wed probably have to undo most of it um Its either or PM Yeah ME Although we dont wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way were marketing this as like a natural new thing but honestly if we cut that one piece out were actually coming in under budget if Ive done my math correctly PM Hmm UI I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean thats what sets us apart right ME I mean Which its yeah thats what setting us into this young market I mean thats where we started from so I dont know and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league UI And the reality is you know for me from an ideological stand point Id like to stick with the uh the solar cell but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell PM Right ME Right ME Yeah PM Right ME Yeah PM Yeah ME I think unfortunately thats our best option PM I guess we might have to do that PM Its the only way were gonna get below our uh goal isnt it ME Mm PM Of twelve fifty ID Cause we cant remove the push buttons cause theyre um and we cant get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldnt be so much of a mmmm um nor would changing the case materials PM Yeah ME It kind of yeah UI Savings ME Mmmm ID Um ID So yeah that looks like to be the only thing ME Yeah ID So that would be the its a major change but Yeah PM Gotta do what you gotta do ID Alright so were in agreement on that ME Unfortunately I think we are UI No I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah ID Right ID Moving along swiftly ID Um so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over ME That would be me ME Um cord ID Ah of course sorry ME No problem ID Whoosh ME Can you reach that would be great thank you UI Yep ID Thatd be great Brilliant ME I didnt even do that one on purpose either damn ME Okay um basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do these are the things that look like we feel theyre important ME Um so I was looking at basic design things does it fulfil its functions as a remote ME Is the design what we wanted it to do ME I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ME Um ME Basic questions like you know does it turn on ME Does it respond to voice recognition ME And overall in general it looks like its coming up to par PM Mm ME Um the only thing is with with the pullout panel that is can it take some adjusting because its a new sort of interface um that looked like it was coming up rough but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense ME So I think overall were headed in the right direction PM Really good ME So UI They like that spongy feel ME Yeah ME It looks like its going over well so were were good yeah UI And the paging function works well thats good to hear we worked hard on that one PM Six PM We did ME Yeah ME Its I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff but for now what weve got is working in the range we need it for so its all good PM I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but its okay ME Thats everything from me ID Hmm ME Yeah PM Mm ME Yeah it is a setback but Okay do you need the cord back UI W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that were I guess thats true ID Um yeah I was just go on PM I know ID Well they dont own tellys anyway do they PM True ID Right ID So um this ones a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair um ID I got this slide from the coach and Im not sure what its connected to ID Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report ID So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked I guess um PM Okay ME As in within the team or ID I think so yeah PM Right so its just kind of a open mic kind of thing or Kay ME Okay ID I think its I mmhmm I think so ID I think hope Im not screwing up an experiment ME It is now youre in charge so there you go ID But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough PM Yeah ME Whatever ID Um right um so any thoughts PM Are we considering these points here ME Um ID Yeah PM Okay ME I think theyre starting blocks yeah ID What do you guys feel about the process ME Um you know I think in general for a days worth of work we actually were relatively productive considering the little amount of input we had going in ID Mmhmm ME Um and the technology has definitely been a help its really been interesting to try out all this new stuff UI We didnt use the whiteboard at all PM No ID No no whiteboard ME No we didnt ME We could now if thatd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints doesnt really matter UI And Um also had I not been intrigued about the pen I dont think I woulda used it at all I didnt write barely anything ME Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just cause I liked the pen yeah PM Yeah its true UI Uh PM Mm ID Was pretty cool tack though UI Yeah ME Mm PM Definitely ME I am disappointed I didnt get a note back from my personal coach PM As you write your personal coach ME Yeah but I didnt get a response so well see PM What if you get a response two or three months from now ME Okay that would be kinda creepy PM Thatd be weird ID Attempts to contact coach ineffective ME Well what kind of coaching is that really ME What if I really needed something UI I so I dont n I think there was a lot of room for creativity we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us um ME I think so ME And even then we did get a decent product turned out although its not everything we wanted it to be PM Yeah UI With the natural look PM Thats very natural ID Very natural look ME Organic really ID Thats the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here ME And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus PM Yeah ID Yeah I think yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually I mean ME Mm yeah Im impressed UI I think the teamwork was good as well PM And to prove that we werent wasteful we didnt waste a single bit of PlayDoh we used every bit ME Nice ME All four of those little containers PM Yeah I guess My one my one criticism is that we didnt have enough colours to work with we only had four wasnt enough ID Including the s the multicoloured wave pattern ME Yeah ME You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours PM I know it could have been amazing ME Oh well ID What did you guys think about the the the roles PM Hmm ME They were good PM Yeah its f kind of fun it was I think it was pretty clever cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough ME Yeah ME True PM At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up which was kind of fun ME Do your own ME Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day PM Yeah ME I mean maybe its just me but I didnt actually get any information for the last presentation at all ID Thats true I I got this spreadsheet ME Nothing I didnt even get an email like that was it ME So yeah I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity upped UI Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more which was fine ME Whatever ID Of what to do PM Mm ME Mmhmm ME Uhhuh that wasnt very much PM You know Yeah ME Mm ME Yes ID Mm mm ME Hmm very much so PM Yeah PM That was fun PM I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you cause if we didnt have that theres no way we could have got all that done in time UI Mmhmm ME Yeah already having the formatted stuff helped a lot ME Very much so ID Cool UI And I think your leadership was quite good PM It was really good yeah ME Hmm ID She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy youre getting into this and I really I think its true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it ME Yeah ME Thats kind of a good thing though you know give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey ID I felt like I slipped into it a lot PM Its kinda fun ID I dunno UI An so is that the first time youve taken on that kind of role ID The first time Ive ever done anything like yeah project project management ID I usually organise crap its one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends you know ME Hmm PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Little different ID But you guys felt that you could keep the yeah suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ME Yeah PM Yeah ME I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth other than that I could only imagine PM Yeah UI I had to admit as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the PlayDoh th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window ID Yeah yeah ID Maybe in in Legos you know UI Possibly ID Be fun with Legos too like make a remote control or spaceship we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever UI Oh yeah still have em ME Yeah ME Totally ID Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all PM Yeah ME I think so UI Yep ID Hmm PM You dont ID No I no I dunno I d I I dunno I dont I I was just I Its true huh ME Though we didnt actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasnt except for the actual building but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming use the board well and this would have been six months worth of work not like three hours worth of meetings PM Yeah ID Yeah UI I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team PM Yeah ME Thats true ID Yeah ID Course Im Im conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like theres a team you know its like kind of like like hmm ID It d But yeah ME Yeah that is kind of Mine was the mics ID Interesting ID Its kind of fascinating wasnt it ID I mean the whole process of I dont know PM Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ID I I dont know if there was a ri I th Mm ME I didnt feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires I was afraid I was gonna break something actually PM Yeah thats it cause the mics are loose and each time you get up its s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah UI Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board ME True but it didnt even occur to me as an option I mean I dont know that I would have but I know that I consciously didnt ID Nor I UI I mean its just like the paper I dont know what I really needed the paper for ME True UI Um because Ive got this laptop ME Yeah UI Standard I just used it cause its literally right in front of me ME Yeah ID I wanna see the output files from these um from the digital paper ME Well it looks really professional ID I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap ME I know PM Yeah thats it ID I mean just to see what it looks like in PDF format or something PM Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didnt because New ideas ME I know I felt like I needed to be professional so I didnt like draw all over my paper and stuff ME Okay well not entirely but still I doodled less than I usually do ID T I Im curious about what the debriefing is gonna be like ID You know like what is the uh what exactly were looking for here UI So is this all we need to get through ID I dunno Im not sure what the new ideas found i is about ME I guess ME Um ME It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that UI Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ID Well thats the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there mmhmm ME That slide was like that ID I didnt change this one at all PM Hmm ME Well ID Um ch Yeah well PM I guess were on the right track ID W I kinda like th Yeah you cant Yeah PM No none ME Uh I think they still do their job PM I think theyre fine actually ME I am thinking outside the little square box though with literally in like form I dont Yeah PM Yeah maybe a s a circle would be alright different ID Does kinda make you wonder I mean how much can you do with a remote control ID Its like inventing a new car ID Yeah yeah you can Yeah ME Its still gotta be technically car shaped or it wont fit on the road you know ME Dont know ID Hmm ID Um UI What is that ID Kay UI Our limited ability to think outside the box ME Kind of ID So this was other costs PM Are we back into project mood ID I dunno ID I think this is forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval um ME Oh how long was our meeting supposed to be ME How much time do we have left ID I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit understimulated on the whole thing ID Like what like you know what am I really doing you know what is Yep ME Mm ME Yeah at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well its just another two minute presentation that you guys dont really care about anyway so type away PM Yeah UI Why ID Hey UI Huh I think it was the real ME You know you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didnt feel like it mattered anymore PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like you know not very much ME Mmhmm ME Whatever ID Mm ME Yeah UI Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste whats given to you into your presentation which uh wasnt so clear to me at the beginning PM Yeah ME Very much yeah ID I actually didnt do that at all though every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited em PM Mmhmm ID I di Oh UI Oh I added like five slides too but I Yeah mine too ME See I only got blank ones PM Did you really PM I just got blank ones and Me too ID What ID Really ME My slides were all blank theyd have a title maybe and they were just empty ID Did they not have they didnt like uh mine yeah they didnt come like this ID Like with this was what it looks like ME Like with those words already on it ID This is what that looked like literally just like that ME No UI No ID Interesting ME I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated ID Uhhuh huh huh PM I deleted slides ME I think I added a slide one time UI I added many slides every time Yeah ME Hey with the whole new background being innovative yeah that was class PM That was pretty cool it was a high moment of the whole experiment ME Mm UI Um ID Interesting ID Any other thoughts come to mind ME I wanna know how our product would fare ME I cant just leave it there PM I think it would fail I think itd be a huge disaster especially if it looks like that ME I think it would take extensive marketing okay an apple with a red button on top even I am sceptical ME But you know the whole Yeah UI Even you PM I dont we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face ME I know it is ID Yeah but Builds PM Its a happy face UI Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications ME Mm ID Mm UI I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random KitKat bar that happened to be consumed ME I I noticed that ME By accident ID Interesting ME Well huh ME An interesting day all in all I would say ID Uh yeah Id say so PM Yeah its uh I wanna see a Yeah UI So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups especially between culture groups and what not ME I know ID Mm I know UI Mm ID It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically ME I Yeah ID You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing the whole concepts phase I dont think I really understood like the concept ID Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i its not like I have a concept of a mugs material its just it is what it is ME Cause its such a functional item ID You know maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea ID And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever I dunno ME Mm ID But PM Hmm ID All in all its kinda interesting ME Mm PM So we have more slides or ID No just this closing one ID No weve established that the costs werent really within budget but we could s you know do it We did the project evaluation based on um Sarahs evaluation of on off switches and Mm ME We got it to be ME Like cutting corners ME Kind of though it was really technically an evaluation of the product not the project in general PM Mm ME Which Im not sure is the same thing at the time that just i made more sense but I could see if they were really asking about us ID True ID Yeah ID Cause we di we had a thu think about it ID Um ID Yeah ID And its all recorded woohoo ID Yeah what Im gonna Im gonna put um Im supposed to do this final report thing at the end so Ill put all that into the final report as well or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff like because and if and so forth but Ill put most of it in the reports ME Yay PM Hmm PM I Itd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording ME Make it sound eloquent ME Oh I have to done Ive Ive done transcription before and its really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing ID Nice ID Oh yeah ID Theres a whole branch of psychology that looks into that psycholinguistics UI What the uhs and the Mm PM Really ME Theres a guy studying it here yeah hes studying ums and ahs or something PM Filler words or ID Yep theyre called um disfluencies ME Yeah PM Disfluencies ME Thats a good word for it ID Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things ME Just add some prefixes sounds classier ID Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents PM I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot just out of boredom like c come on gimme something ME I yeah pretty compulsively during meetings like yeah ID Yeah ID Oh yeah ID Yeah I know ID Come on give me some information ID Well to be fair were were hooked were all hooked on the internet so I mean I do the I know imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet ME Yeah we are addicts UI Thats scary yeah PM It is scary ME Mm UI Well just around that eight or or nine people that are Dude I think weve had internet for like eighteen years ID Its only in the last ten that were like wheres the internet ME Yeah ID I mean you know it just in the past five weve gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time ME I yeah ME True ID No we have but I not in the sense that its so un you know uh ubiquitous Mm ME I yeah PM Yeah ME But its not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four but still PM Its crazy ME Uhhuh PM So Should UI In the eighties ME My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an EDU and gov network ME Theres basically the fundamental structures but it wasnt uh household to household yet because it hadnt been partitioned off and stuff yeah that was him UI Right UI Yeah it was to the like seven universities or something UI You guys ready to celebrate ID Yeah thats our last step ME Apparently does that include like champagne or something exciting ID Celebration ME I think so ID Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part ME I think thats a closer ID Cool PM Has it been forty minutes or whatever PM this has been long enough UI Celebrate ID Where do you find that ME I have no idea PM Is that the only song you have UI There is another one ID Is this one of those media player UI Huh UI Yep ID W oh PM Thats awesome ID The default track PM Maybe I have a different one ID I thought it was David Burns look into the eyeball ID Thats one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while maybe this is the new version ME So is that a close ID Yeah I guess well call that a a doner ME Okay thats the end of the meeting ID Fab ME Thank you gentlemen ME I feel like Im signing off,"The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen, to hide the complicated features, and to start building the prototype). The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition, interchangeable cases, visible light, and a soft casing material. The Project Manager presented what each component cost, which showed that the project was going over the alotted budget; the group decided to remove the solar panel. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype and showed that the prototype had met many of the initial goals. The group then evaluated the project process and discussed their effectiveness as a group. The Project Manager summarized the proceedings of the meeting which will go into a final report, along with comments made during the project evaluation."
ID Okay ID Hi everybody and welcome to our kickoff meeting um for our new product that were gonna be designing ID Um Im Mandy and Im the Project Manager ID And I know all your names again Courtney Fenella and Amber ME Yep PM Yep ID Alright ID Okay so first lets go through this PowerPoint ID I wonder what button I press UI Just do it on the arrow ID Yeah or how about I just click ID Okay here is our agenda for this meeting ID Um were gonna start with our opening which was our introductions ID Were gonna get to know each other a little bit better ID Um tool training were going to I guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles ID Um were gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting ID Okay here is our project ID Were gonna make a new remote control thats um original trendy and also userfriendly ID And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um Were gonna have discuss the functional design first how is it gonna be used whats the actual goal here it has to operate TV blah blah blah ID And were going to do individual work on that and then meet ID Same thing with conceptual design ID Just the basic overview of the project and then were going to do individual work meet ID Thats pretty much the the whole process for today ID And then the detailed design just more indepth get the actual schematics of the remote ID Okay ID Alright ID First were gonna start off by using our tools ID And the whiteboard thing do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasnt working or do you wanna do it on here PM I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we cant actually see what were writing ME We could Yeah we could on here ID Alright lets go forward then ID Um right now so were all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal ID Even if you are not a good drawer like me ID Alright PM Artistic skills nil UI Fine ID Um ID Bless you ME Oh thanks PM I draw like Im in grade five ID Oh do I ID Kay about one more minute ID Okay ID Okay ID And who would like to start us off ME Ill go ID Alright ME Um this is my picture ME I drew fish I like fish because uh you know their whole watervascular system thing ME Its pretty cool and um theyve got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but thats okay ME Yeah ID Only if theyre piranhas ME Yeah they theyre easy you know ME Yeah ID Alright ID Who wants to go next PM Ill go PM I drew a kitty PM Its pretty much impossible to tell thats a cat but I love cats ME No I I see it UI No I kne I knew ID No it looks like a cat ME Yeah it does look like a cat PM I love cats because theyre independent uh they pretty much know what they want they get it they move on ID I love cats too UI Yeah ID Im a cat person ME Im allergic to cats UI Ah ID Uh PM Im allergic to cats too ME Oh okay ID If youre around one I had a roommate who was um allergic but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it you know its weird UI In my next life ME Yeah yeah if youre around them for a long period of time Oh yeah this summer I oh I had to live with cats PM I still cant sleep with them in my room ID Okay ME It was crazy ME Yeah ID Okay Fenella UI Um I drew a badger ME Cool PM Yay ID Badger UI Well yeah ID Good choice ID Why a badger UI Uh I dunno theyre grumpy and nocturnal and Well a little bit like the Yes PM Are you trying to suggest something UI Um UI And then if you know Wind in the Willows badger ME Oh okay UI Yeah and then uh I dont know if you know Brian UI Hes Liverpudlian writer ID Alright UI Um that kind of books UI Badgers are cool in that one too ID Okay ID And Im last ID Kay ID Look at my sad sad giraffe ME No thats good ID No no no it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur but whatever ID I dont know even much about giraffes but I just love the way they look ID Theyre just such odd creatures you know ID I I like that theyre so unique and individual I guess ID I dont know much about their behaviour or anything though ID Only seen a couple in zoos ME You dont really have to I mean if you like em Right ID Yeah but you can appreciate the way they look ID Okay ID Alright ID Guess were getting straight back into business here ID Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twentyfive Euro and our profit aim is fifty million Euro ID Were going to make this an international product marketed in the States in Europe in Asia ID And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote ID Okay ID So were gonna talk for a little while ID Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss ID Expe our experiences with remote controls um our first ideas about this new remote anything that you can bring to the table for this project ID So UI Now ID Yeah ID You wanna start us off ID Anybody have anything to offer PM Well we wanna make a multifunctional remote right ID Right PM One remote for everything UI And everything being Wait we have what sound system TV DVD VHS uh TiVo PM Um PM I think theyll be phasing VHS out shortly ME Yeah TiVo ID TiVo UI But its still there so if po if were gonna do it Or if its not like a Sony if its like a I dont know PM Okay ME It needs to be compatible cause universal remote controls are never universal ID Theyre never universal ID Thats right ID Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product DVD player say usually it doesnt work if its not one of the Yeah ID Yeah ID Something from Sams club PM So well have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals ID Yeah ME And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways ID Yeah ID Kay and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product how it feels in your hand ID If its just flat and kind of boring th those dont Nobody wants to buy those any more ID They want the ergonomic ones ME They want like the flashy lights ID Yeah ME Oh like this came from Las Vegas ID Ones that ones that look hightech too UI But at the same time are simple ME Mm yeah ID Right ID So that people like my mother can use it PM What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ID Yeah ID Kay ID Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah UI Just bad ones ID Thats true UI Um PM What kinda battery would we want to use PM Because battery changing is usually Okay UI D Double A ME Double A ID Do some of them use triple As though ME Yeah some use triple As UI Some but Yeah I guess then its If we need to do triple A we can but most people usually have double As around ME So double or triple ID Okay ID Okay ID Yeah ID But that has to do with the size of it too UI Right PM Yeah ID Well w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A ME Yeah if we want it to be more thin then wed probably wanna go with a triple A PM Can you with a small lithium battery ID But its okay we dont have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important ID Hey ID Anything else ID Alright ID Moving along ID Oh were closing the meeting ID Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes ID Heres what were going to do ID Um the ID which is who ID Okay youre going to think about the working design ID What do you think that means ID Okay ID And UID the technical fun functions design making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it operating all those different things UI Mmhmm ID Okay ID And the marketing person thats Courtney is going to do the user requirements specification ID I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for ID Right ME Right ID I would think so ID Okay ID And youre gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while ID Okay so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ID Okay ID This meeting is officially over,"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. She then introduced a tool training exercise to acquaint the group with the meeting-room tools and to help them get to know each other. The Project Manager then presented the project budget to the group and presented the projected profit aim, the production cost, and the price point of the device. The group then began a discussion about features of remote controls and their own  experiences with them. They discussed making the remote universally compatible and ergonomically-designed, and types of batteries to use. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the internal working design of the device. The User Interface Designer was told to work on the technical function design, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to research the needs of users."
ID Okay ID Um welcome to our second meeting ID This is the functional design meeting ID And I hope you all had a good individual working time ID Okay lets get started ID Okay heres the agenda for the meeting ID After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary take the meeting minutes ID And were gonna have three presentations one from each of you ID Then were gonna discuss some new project requirements ID Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control ID And then were gonna close up the meeting ID And were gonna do this all in about forty minutes ID Okay ID First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting ID First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control ID And then were going to determine the technical functions what is the effect of the apparatus what actually is it supposed to do what do people pick up the remote and use it for ID And then lastly were going to determine its working design how exactly will it perform its functions thats the whole technical side of Kay Ill just give you a minute cause it looks like youre making some notes ID Kay ID Oh well lets go ahead and back previous ID So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did ID Who would like to start us off UI I dont mind going first ID Kay ID Okay ID Um do you have a PowerPoint or no UI Yeah its in the should be in the m Project ID Okay ME Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or I can go UI You know you could you could do it yourself actually ID Oh PM Did you send it ID Save it in the project documents UI Put it in Project Documents yeah ID Okay ID Mmmmmm ID This one UI Sure ID Okay UI Yeah PM Okay UI Okay PM Great UI Um well the function of a remote control as what uh weve been informed is basically to send messages to the television set for example switch it on switch it off go to this channel go to channel nine turn the volume up etcetera UI Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include its the numbers you know zero to nine so you can move to a channel the power button on slash off the channel going up and down volume going up and down and then mute a mute function UI And then functions for VHS DVD for example play rewind fastforward stop pause enter UI And enter would be for like you know the menus UI And then other menus for DV as well as TV whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen things like that all the more complicated functions of menus UI And we can decide if thats what we want um if we want to include that on the remote if thats something that would stay on the TV itself for example ID Okay ID Okay UI These are two examples UI Um and you can see on the left its got a lot more buttons and I dont know if you can read it but it says step go to freeze um slow repeat program mute and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example UI And then on the right its a lot more simpler its got volume its got the play the like circle set which is play rewind but its also what is fastforward is also like next on a menu UI So you have functions that are d uh duplicating ID Right UI And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject and the power button UI So that gives you two different kinds a more complex and more simple version UI Okay ID Ready UI And then lastly its just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include and how simple complex it should be UI And what functions it needs to complete UI Uh what are needed to complete insulation process cause you know thats something that also has to be considered and its gonna be hopefully a onetime thing when you set it up it should be set to go but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place UI So thats it ID Alright ID Very good presentation ID Thank you ID You speak with such authority on the matter UI Mm ID Okay UI Left ID Who would like to um follow that one up ID Now that weve discussed Okay ID Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay ME Yeah you should run it ID Functional requirements ME Mm yes ID Kay ID Alright ID Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements ME Yes okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls ME Seventy five percent think theyre ugly ME Eighty percent want theyve are willing to spend more which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier and basically w we just need something that really I mean theres some other points up there but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple ME So thats really what we need to do UI Wait ME And we need we need it to be simple yet it needs to be hightech looking ME So Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot UI And that meaning what UI Okay ME Yeah ME I dont know ME Its from my uh research UI Right ID Okay what do you m Oh Im sorry ME My team wasnt very clear UI Only use ten percent of the buttons ME Thats okay ID What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user like they have to press the buttons ME I I think its like the engineering versus user whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users dont really need all of the buttons that are contained on there because they only use ten percent of the buttons really ID Okay ID Oh right ID The buttons ID Okay ID Yeah ID Okay PM We only use ten per cent of our brains ME Good point ID It works ME Its a necessary evil PM yeah ID Ready for the next slide ME Mmhmm ME And so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know because you probably lose your remote control all the time much like any small appliance like a cellphone and they we need something simple because most people well thirty four percent say that its just too much time to learn how to use a new one and we dont want to go we dont want to vary too far from the normal standard remote but I mean they do need to be able to identify it and RSI Im not very sure what that is ID Hmm UI Lost UI S Wait is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ID Its okay ID Its very important ME Yes it is important for the remote control world ME Sh Uh possibly ID Could be yeah PM Do we really need t to provide more information on what RSI is UI Like Channel volume power ID Oh ME Uh yeah thats what my web site said I dont know ID I think thats a pretty good guess though ME Yeah I would assume so ME I think were supposed to know it as remote control experts UI Its like if youre holding it to just say where are you and thing beeps you know ID Yeah ME But also s so the channel the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used but those are the definitely the top ones ID Its okay ID Okay ID Next slide ME Yes ME And so personally I think that we need a modern eyecatching design but it it really needs to be simple ME So saying from y your slide your presentation the engineering versus the userspecified remotes I think that we should go with something thats more userfriendly ID Userfriendly ME Where the engineering ones the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is ME Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it ME And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers so even though we need a small number of buttons we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a DVD player a TiVo what what exactly are we using it for as well as the age range ME So we need a hip but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product ME And also we found our team found that speech recognition is its like an upandcoming thing they really consumers are really interested in it and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more highclass we could consider it ID And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go to channel five ME I guess so yeah ID Okay ME Yeah I guess we can interpret it like we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme ID Oh thatd be lovely UI Yeah ID Didnt they um didnt our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the TV and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it Mm UI Its kinda like what the remote phone used to do ID Oh yeah thats true UI You know like go to the base ID We could definitely include that if we wanted to UI Yeah ID If its within our price ID Okay ID Are we ready for our last presentation Amber PM Yeah Im just trying to move it ID Okay PM Kay PM I think it should be there working design UI Working design ID There we go ID Kay PM Kay PM Uh I didnt get a chance to complete this one cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating ID Oh my bad ME Oh thats fine PM Uh okay so method method of our design I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this UI Help me PM We need a power source were gonna need a smart chip if were gonna make it multifunctional PM Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip PM Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart ME What exactly is a smart chip PM Usually a smart chip is just a chip thats been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions UI Well how much extra would the additional chip be UI Is that gonna push us over our production costs PM I wouldnt think so cause we could probably get it from like in bulk from a a newer company UI Mmhmm PM And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap ID Okay ID Ready PM Um yep nothing here ID Thats okay PM Um power source I figured batteries cause theyre easily available PM Typically a remote has either two double As or four triple As sometimes three PM Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself PM Um a large onoff button demographically were moving towards an older generation of people so a large onoff button would probably be good ID Hmm PM Selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system PM Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits sorry universal application again something thatll allow us to skip over between devices and thats kinda it PM Uh this is my fifty second design PM Power source over here PM Were gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it and youre gonna need the switch PM Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device PM Um the chip and of course the infrared bulb so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to ME So what exactly we are looking at is this like the front of the remote PM This is just like a rough schematic ID So this would be the front PM So this is the internal workings ID So the red would be the front of the remote though right ME Oh okay PM Yeah UI Yeah thats gonna be whats communicating with the TV but the other bulb I think is good to just to indicate Im doing something its sort of like a reassurance ID Okay ID The l the light up kind of Yeah ME Like that we know the batterys working PM Yeah so you dont have to stare at that infrared cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently you have to actually stare at that bulb and go okay when I push this button is it working ID Hmm ME Okay ID Itd probably be lighting up the key too right PM We can skip that whole thing PM Yep ME Yeah UI Yeah ID Kay PM So you can put it in the dark ID The buttons ME Yeah and thats good ME We should make it glow in the dark ID Okay ID Yeah definitely ID Kay nex R Ready PM Yeah thats it ID Kay any p Kay ME Mm kay ID Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though you f you said already that we needed a large onoff button you think PM I think that thats a good idea because you know thats one of the most important buttons ID Anything else UI Just Well should it be larger buttons in general you know like uh the examples that I had they were swi quite small ID Okay UI So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ME I think we should ME Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design sorry um ME I think we should definitely go with buttons that dont look like a normal remote cause most remotes have small square buttons I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles ID Mm UI Ovals UI Yeah yeah ID Okay ID Okay lets talk about all of our Well come to decision later about all the components that we need to include lets um wrap up this one and Im gonna go back to my PowerPoint cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you mightve already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier ID Wait come back ID Alright ID Sorry lets go through this ID Alright ID Here we go ID New product requirements ID First its only going to be a TV remote ID Were trying not to overcomplicate things ID So no DVD no TiVo no stereo PM Okay ID Its not gonna be multifunctional ID Hey ID And we th need to promote our company more so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote ID Were trying to get our name out there in the world ID Okay ID And you know what teletext is UI Yeah ID in States we dont have it but um its like they just have this channel where just has news and weather kind of sports its very um bland looking its just text on the screen not even Yeah just black with just text UI I know ME What is it UI Yeah its like black black and white kind of Itll give you the sports ME Like running along the bottom ID Yeah PM You can also get the kind of the TV guide so Its the entire screen is just running information at random ME Wait is it like the Weather Channel where its got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ID Kind of UI Except the entire screen ID Yeah its the whole screen UI You can pick sports you can pick the news you entertainment you know its like Yeah ID So anyway Right PM Seemingly ME So its like a separate channel from like what youre watching ID Right ID But its becoming outdated now because of the Internet ID Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news and we have twenty four hour news channels now too so Those are our new product requirements ME Okay PM Okay PM So do we have to include the company colour within that ID Alright ID Mmhmm ID Yes ID Its part of the logo ID Okay UI Company colour being yellow ID What were going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then well close up the meeting ID So ID Alright ID Whatever ID Okay ID So our target group is You mentioned um older people UI Mmhmm ID Would it just be universal for everyone you think ID Because I think even if something has large buttons as long as they are not childishly large like even technically nontechnically challenged people are gonna use it UI Its gonna make it nicer UI Yeah ID I mean they want something userfriendly so Yeah PM Mm well even if we kept the regular standard size of remote if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra cause theyre saying they only use ten per cent of them then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons ID Yeah ID Okay so we want um for our target group would we say I mean young and old all age ranges all um not kids obviously right ID Or kids ME No kids need to know how to use a remote I would think PM Most of them will intuitively pick it up though ME They gotta change between Disney Channel Cartoon Network ID Okay so were going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about technic technical um specifications like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ME Yeah I think we need it all ME Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person UI We should go for the lowest denominator ID Okay ME Yeah ID Right okay UI High school educated ID So so they need no technical experience to operate Okay PM how bout little to no because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no ID And we also need to determine the specific functions of this just to get it all out on paper ID So we said it needs to send messages to the TV needs to change the channel turn on and off just basic simple stuff like this ID So if you have something just say it and well add it to my meeting minutes UI Well its channel onoff button volume mute ID Mmhmm volume ME And channel ME Yeah ME Those are the most important ones ID Right ID And we wanna keep um Ill make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down ID Correct because people only use ten percent ME Yeah ID Kay ID Hey what else UI Um ID Um PM Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ID I think so ID What do you A finding kind of device or Yeah ho homing device ME Sure yeah PM And like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ME I need we we need a like homing device UI Oh right yeah okay ID Mm kay UI Tracking ME Because people really are looking for a remote thats more hightech ID Okay ID Right PM What if we gave it a charger PM And on the charger just like a phone like you get a portable phone and its got a charger and if you d leave your phone somewhere you push the button to find it and it finds th the phone beeps for you UI But you got a base ME Do you think peoplell really go for that though ME Because Yeah PM Its useful for the remote phone ID Hmm ID Would that add to our costs at all I wonder ME I would think so because youd have to develop a base ID Right UI Well if you have the base you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery PM Yeah ME Hmm PM Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually UI Yeah ID Okay ID I I think we can make a decision about that later ID Uh well still put that as a point that we need to discuss ID So that would include battery source Power source rather ID Is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ID And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition if we want that ME Right ME Do w Well th theres the people who desire speech recognition theres the different demog demographics have different desires I dont know if you guys ge It wouldnt copy onto the the thing cause its black but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition UI Well then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic ID Mm ID You could um we could hook it up ID Oh ME So basically older people dont really care ME Its really the people twenty five to thirty five ME I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though ID Mmhmm ME Theyre the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff UI Well Well then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual remote cause then youve already got remote in your hand why you just gonna speak to the remote whereas if you just speak in general and you dont have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it ID And if and if we introduced it when theyre this age theyre going to probably always buy a remote that has Right ME Right ME So Right ID Yeah ID and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too ID If we said find remote locate remote or something ID A certain phrase then it could beep ID I dunno ID Just throwing it out there ME Yeah ID Well Okay anything else we wanna discuss UI Still fifteen minutes UI Um UI Well do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine UI Can we conceive of leaving them out ID Um ME Wait on the remote itself UI Yeah like you have one two three four five six seven eight nine zero ME Well we definitely need those ID How how yeah how would you leave those out PM Yeah UI Well I dont know I mean if you can like well I dont know if theres just a way of leaving them out ID Unless you could say the channel PM I think people would find that too foreign ME Yeah ID Yeah thats true ME You definitely need Wait ID And also remember that in this day in age we need you know like a hundred button too ID I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty ID So I couldnt whenever I got cable I had to get a new TV PM Its when we get satellite ID Mm ID get your own remote or digital cable PM Yeah ID Kay ID Um ID I guess were gonna discuss the project financing later making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget ID Um PM Yeah cause I dont have any material pricing information available to me at the moment so R the double R ID Kay ID And dont forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo UI The colour being yellow ID Im guessing UI And how do we Cant make it entirely Well if you have like a Hang on ME I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish ID And the RR ID We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys PM Or is the l Yeah yellow could be and it could doesnt have to be huge ME Or put like stripes oh yeah yellow lights ME Yeah UI If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it just like yellow with the RR ID Right ID So weve simplified we dont need all those um play fastforward rewind or no menu buttons UI Right yeah ME Yeah ID So weve pretty much pared it down to onoff volume mute channel up and down um the numbers Yeah ME Yeah ID Um can we go back to Im gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything UI Two examples UI Yeah ID Which one is yours technical functions or functional requirement UI Oh its a Yeah ID Okay ME Yeah audi audio settings and screen settings we need those like audio settings mono stereo pitch screen settings like brightness colour or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ID The TV ID I think that thats fine just for the TV ID I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff UI Well the other option is sort of like down at the bottom like farther away you just have this sort of box inset where its like the buttons that you dont use as much but occasionally you will use ID Hmm ME Yeah cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that UI and so its like I dont well I dont know ME Its cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles its tons of Spanish network television if it has English subtitles its definitely helpful ID Couldnt we do that all through one button something a menu button that pops up with a menu on the TV that says you know audio video whatever language you know UI Right ME So we need up down and sidetoside buttons UI Well that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons ID For the menus PM Mmhmm ID Thats true ME Yeah okay UI Channel is just up and down ME Okay yeah UI And then add a Yeah ID Something that looks mayb you know ME Such as yeah the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one ID Y right right right right ID That one UI So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu ID Right ID In the middle perhaps ID Yep ME Ooh I just got an idea for a design ID good ID Anybody have anything else theyd like to bring up in this meeting PM I had something but I forgot ID Okay ID get out of here ID Lets go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next ID Mm ID Alright ID After this meeting were gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that email ID And then were gonna have lunch break ID And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time ID Um Im gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder if youd like to review them ID And Im gonna type up the minutes for this one as well ID Um heres what were each going to do ID The ID is going to work on the components concept um UID the user interface concept and youre going to do some trend watching ID Kay ID Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach ID And if anybody has anything they would like to add ID No ID Okay well this meeting is officially over ID Thank you all,"The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed the designs of two existing products, showing an example of the simple design that the group wants to implement. The Marketing Expert presented feedback from users, showing that users want a simple but fancy-looking remote control and that young users want speech recognition. She discussed including only the most basic functions in the interface. The Industrial Designer presented her internal design of the device and discussed the processor chip and the energy sources that will be integrated. She suggested integrating an extra lightbulb that lit up when the remote was communicating with the television. The Project Manager gave the group new requirements for the product design. The group discussed marketing the product to a wide range of customers. They had a discussion about possibly including a locator function and speech recognition. They discussed integrating the company's yellow color and logo into the design, and decreasing the number of buttons in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the components concept, the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface concept, and the Marketing Expert to prepare a trendwatching report."
ID Okay ID Hi Team ID Hope you had a good lunch ID Okay were back for the conceptual design meeting ID Um lets get started ID Kay here is the agenda for todays meeting ID Um were gonna open it and Im gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager ID Were gonna have three presentations one from each of you again ID And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then were gonna close it up ID And we have forty minutes again ID Kay and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control ID Okay ID Lets go ahead and start off with your presentations ID Who would like to go first PM Just trying to move mine right now ID Okay ID Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ME Yeah ID Okay ID Trend watching ME Yeah ID Kay ME Okay so trend watching ME Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how our product looks ME So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next ME So what they want ME Right now customers want fancy versus functional ME Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want describing like the in order of how much they want fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like fancy versus functional and then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use ME So the customer basically is confused ME They dont know exactly what they want ME They want us to tell them PM They want everything but simply ME Yes ME Exactly PM Okay ME So we can go to next ID Mm kay ME Okay ME So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns ME So I dont know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year ME I dont know really I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff youd want like a softer touch ID Mm ID Mm ME I mean do you guys know what I mean ID Right PM Yeah th I I can I can address some of that issue I think with uh my presentation ID Yes ME Yeah ME Um ME But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns I dont know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months because Yeah ID Right ID Right ID People dont buy a new remote every so often ME I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now ME Okay ME Awesome ID Okay ME Um so design preferences um we need easy to read like large buttons clearly labelled so that I mean cause we talked about that being a problem ME Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch you said that in your design with the bulb ME Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme ME Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously ME Thats one of our key goals we wanna promote our product ME And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something ME Actually right here ME So what we could do is something like an oldfashioned telephone like this where we put the buttons around like wed put a big onoff button or something else in the middle I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down and then put the numbers around in like an oldfashioned dial shape ME Cause then itll appeal to older generation and like said retros cool ME So its classically retro ID Hmm ME So I mean thats just an idea if you guys like it ID Very good ID I like it ID Okay ready for the next slide ME And yep ME And thats it ID Op mm kay PM Okay ID Great ID Great presentation ID Ready UI Okay hang on ID Kay UI See if its there ID Which one is it UI I dont know UI Hang on UI Interface concepts no ID Interface concepts new UI Either refresh it or it sh Oh wait maybe I didnt put it there ID Y Kay UI Hang on PM Mine will always read copy of something or other ID Sorry PM I I copied mine before I sent it over ID Oh okay UI Sorry hang on UI Dont know ID Oh there we go UI Okay UI Okay um looking at the interface concept its gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this UI Uh if you wanna start the next slide ID Sure UI Um uh cant really see but theres two possible ways on the r left if you see on th on the sides of of the remote you have the sort of scroll down so you have that option right there UI And then also theres the idea of the base UI Thats sort of like an idea there UI And then on the right we have whats really big trend right now its the iPod UI Its becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons and its sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip but also very sleek and um and very simple but technologically advanced UI So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it but Anyway next ID Mm kay UI Um theres the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight UI Youd you know youre in the dark you dont wanna be looking at the remote control UI And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button its a V and so yo youre kind of feeling a V like volume up UI What it really is is a V and what it you think it is is down because the down arrow ID Mm UI And so its like a sort of a criticism youd probably turn that o the other way up UI Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type which could be you know iffy um sort of oldfashioned in a way ID Mm UI Either that or just have it by shape for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know youre looking at the up and down arrow UI And then the round ones you sort of feel by you know thats the second one down that sort of thing UI So its sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel ID Okay UI Okay UI Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic UI Um this is particularly geared towards children ME Thats cute UI Um its very cute and we could probably change it to yellow bright yellow for like a the for the company logo UI Um and you have the shapes and its very simplistic and friendly looking UI Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch so its like they ch watch you know the C Beebies or something like that uh keep them away from other channels UI So thats like another ar Um I mean these are three examples sort of looking at it ID Okay UI You have the wider section for the main controls there UI Uh you could see how many buttons there are UI And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and a simpler design UI On the bottom we probably wouldnt need that because its more for like a DVD function which we are not gonna be using UI Um UI So again its sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and thats where you could put the RR Real Reaction ID Kay UI And then finally these are like the sort of same examples but also some more just possibilities that we could go with UI None of them Im particularly keen on by the way ME Yeah PM Hmm ID No UI But its sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying well out of this one we like you know the round section of um b or wed like the the button size on this ID Mm ID Or I like you know the black finish or the silver finish or whatever UI Right ME I have four of those remotes ID Good lord ID Okay ID Ready UI Thats it ID Oh yeah ID Okay ID Great job PM Okay my turn ID Okay ME Okay PM Whoo ID Whats the title PM Itll be copy of component design ID Got it PM Yeah PM Th that looks like it PM Kay PM So basic remote operation runs as follows press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit chip senses the connection chip produces a morse code infrared signal specific to that button PM So you press the button it produces uh a signal thats encoded specifically for that button PM Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the TVs centre which interprets the signal response accordingly changes channel etcetera PM So that being said Next slide please PM Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed we need rubber for buttons aluminium for battery y contacts integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor resonator resistors and a capacitator all those basic things that make a circuit function PM Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself PM An LED which is a light emitting diode um contact discs for the buttons plastic for the casing and a powersource whatever powersource weve actually determined we want PM Next slide please PM Thank you PM Uh personal preferences uh to save money for the components the remote should be massproduced and basic materials should be bought en masse PM Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips casing LED any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it PM Next slide please PM Um just talking to the um manufacturing division PM They suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo and kinetic power so you shake it and it increases the power PM Um Im not sure how the hand dynamo works they have yet to get back to me on that PM So next slide please ID Hmm ID Interesting PM Suggested casing options PM Okay PM We can offer options for casing such as straight curved doublecurved you know very specific to the customer PM Options for materials plastic rubber titanium wood PM I dont think anyones gonna go for a wood one because splinters Yeah ME That would be amazing though yeah ME No splinters would What is that PM Um certain restrictions do apply here though PM Uh latex you cant do solar power with a latex one PM So if they want some a soft squishy rubber they cant have the solar powered option PM Doublecurved you cant do titanium PM Um that would be two curvatures so it would actually if you the shape of your hand you curve here and you curve here so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold ID Mm ME Mm PM Now if you wanted that you cant do titanium PM And uh so you functions what for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves UI Right PM I think I have one more slide ID Kay PM No I didnt ID No okay PM Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and theyve just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip which we could utilise PM Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip PM So depends on what we decide we wanna do PM In addition to that if were offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote were going to have to have multiples of each type like a doublecurved in rubber um you know each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options PM So well have to mix it up make sure we produce enough of everyone PM But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand you know doublecurved wooden remotes ID Mm ME Right ME Okay ID Hmm PM And thats all I got ID Okay ID Alright well thank you for those informative presentations ID Lets go back to um Now we have to make some decisions ID Where were we UI Let me just add one more thing that I couldnt say before and thats just that theres the new technology that theyve developed on the voice recognition ID Sure UI Um ME Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier UI Right except that its sort of odd and Im no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are um theres a sample sensor and theres a sample speaker unit for So you would say like good morning coffeemaker and it would respond good morning Jill but Im not sure exactly how its gonna work cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions UI So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and cant change it in order for it to be recognised or can it be altered in a certain way or does the actually user program it to say a channel means this ID Mm ID Right ME Yeah like using the menu to be like enter your name into the screen like on the menu options ID Right ME So that way the remote reads it UI Right so its got like a limited memory and programme it UI So its sort of iffy but thats kind of what youd say ID Mm ME I feel like voice recognition would be I dont know w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it but Technology ID Hmm ID Programme ID If its within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology Hmm PM Well we are making the chip PM So I mean But I guess we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway ME And it is a growing trend the higher technological like the I mean just like the more advanced it is the better itll sell PM Yeah ID Mm PM Yeah PM I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different you know I think wed have to decide on the power options maybe ID Hmm PM So that we could reduce cost ME Yeah cause we need to know how big its gonna be and how heavy PM Yeah ID Okay that kind of brings us to this lets lets see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost PM Okay ID Um ID Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ME Oh the base yeah ID The base the charging base with rechargeable batteries PM I think the p Thats true UI I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like before Cause if its something really really small then its sort of harder to imagine a base for it that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up Right ID Hmm ID Yeah and we dont have multiple things that it has to control it just has to control the TV ME W We need to decide well so we can figure how big its gonna be like exactly what buttons we want and exactly It could be like this ID Its not gonna be a huge universal remote ID What size battery and Right UI Well the other thing is like even if its got a few buttons so we want it to be bigger than this cause it still fits in your hand so you still wanted something thats comfortable and substantial but not necessarily full of buttons ME Yes ME Id well uh This one is really comfortable like I like the sides whatever because But if we have the um the locator then we dont have to worry about that UI Are you gonna lose it easier ME So we can make it small if we have a l locating device PM If we do a voiceactivated locator though were gonna be looking at a more substantial chip UI Yeah PM So Honestly I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact Mm yeah ME Hmm UI So i Thats the other thing its like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ME Two double As for this size UI But like you know if we get more complicated then its gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size ME Right ID I agree its either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy ME Yeah UI So we sh Yeah ME Smaller without Yeah ID Alright so what direction do you want to go in ID You wanna vote ME I think if we had a a locating device with the small one I think that seems way more advanced ID Im kind of Im kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base PM Yeah UI Im a away from the base UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Kay so The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash ID That just seems so clunky and Okay ME Yeah because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now those trends the smaller the hotter it is yeah Oh UI Smaller and smaller yeah yeah yeah UI Youre kidding PM You know it happens ID Hmm ME Yeah PM Ive had three watches go that way too UI Oh watches Ive but Ive never washed a cell phone ME Ouch ME A phone whoa that would wow that would hurt ID Okay so what kind of material do we want to be made out of PM Pieces everywhere PM Well we have lots of options PM I dont think wood is a viable option ME Yeah wood ID No UI Well titanium s I was saying that titanium if were being restricted then I would probably lean away from that ID Oh what did you Oh sorry go ahead ME Yeah cause if its gonna cost us more to produce a chip titanium will be more expensive ID Right PM However well we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right ID What would you recommend ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium make them a rarity so to speak UI Thatll Yeah exactly ID Mm UI The selling point yeah ME We could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if Good plan UI Are we restricted by this PM Yeah PM Well the original Okay ID I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right nowIm not sure that well have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes UI Twenty five Euros So youre talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then its all gonna be cherrycoloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ID If this was a successful remote we might then produce a higher end version of it I think PM Yeah PM Good plan ID Okay so we wanna go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials PM Honestly Id recommend like um uh since were going with batteries instead of solar power Id recommend maybe a uh soft like latex because we could produce you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour ID Hmm PM We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so because this year is all fruit God only knows why um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids you know They could come back ME Oh ID Mmhmm ID Mm ME Yeah who knows ID Okay ME O or we could like take off this ID They could buy cases maybe if they wanted PM And buy the extra case UI Okay ID I think its good to sell a basic thing and then sell options PM So we could do like a b a hard base plastic and then we could give two latex covers to start ME Yeah UI The what the top face right ME Yeah ID Okay ID Okay ME Yeah because the soft latex definitely is squishy ME Thats in ME Well I mean squishier than like yeah just a hard plastic ID Right ID Right ID Okay and what kind of chip would we need for this guy PM How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated Well we could give it a specific code you know remote missing UI Yeah ID I dont think we should do voice I think we should just do um the recognition for when its lost you know UI A tracker yeah ID could we Yeah ME Cause that uh what it type of yeah for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like because people could just be talking and we dont want it going off all the time ID Hmm ID Right ME So uh Ooh ME Uh see Im uh Im strangely attracted to it because I know thats its definitely gonna be big because its I dont know its just so hightech UI Well my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders thats like a keyring and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work PM Yeah see that would just irritate me UI And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse and you couldnt turn it off ID Oh dear ME Oh then maybe voice maybe voice activation wont be good UI So it became highly irritating ID Okay PM So I think having a keyphrase is much better ID Okay ID Alright ID But its not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right ME Yeah n n no we just want it to be a finder UI But then it Hmm ID Just a Okay alright PM No UI Okay ME But do can your can the department make Oh brilliant then PM That would be like a midclass um Yeah PM So we dont actually have to go for Well if theyve just developed the sample sensor sample speaker its a brand new chip PM Why not introduce it in this way ID No ME Yeah good point ID Mm kay ID Uh and what size batteries double A triple A ME I think triple A itll be lighter ID Two ID Could it run off of two Theyre more expensive though too ME I mean more more come in a package UI Well that depends on what the energy is needed ME Yeah PM I think well we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products right PM So theyre more widely available now PM And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries PM But if you only have to replace it every five years ID Mm ME Thats a good point ID Thoughts anybody UI As long as we sell it with it PM Well how about a initial you get one battery when you buy it cause Im pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk UI Right thats what I meant ME We could think about it and come back to it next meeting ID Okay ID Yeah PM Yeah ME We still have one more meeting ID Alright ID Okay ID So weve covered that first category User Interface Concept meaning design UI Whats it gonna Yeah whats it gonna look like ID Okay UI Um ID I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial and that the central button could have maybe our logo on it ID It might be the four way scroll too ME Yeah it could be whatever as long as theres something big in the middle because like the old phones theres like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle ID I mean if Yeah ID Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Well my issue with that is if it got too big though cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ID Mm ME Oh thats true ME Good point PM In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a handshape like if we put the the scrollbutton on the side that could be particularly useful ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Oh I see what you mean ID I think so ME So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ID Yeah I like that ID Kay ME But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side we definitely have to have em labelled ID Mm ME Yeah like on the side of it PM Well if its just up and down Volume or channel ME Oh if its just up and down UI But is that for Which PM I dont know ME Well you could do some on both sides UI Do we have both sides ID Can we PM Mm yeah PM We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then cause oth otherwise youre not just holding it and going like this you know ME Yeah ID So that youre just not holding it and it changes the chan Mm ME Thats squishy ME Thats squishy UI Well the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side ME have buttons PM Okay ID Yeah ME Yeah that ID Hmm ID Kay any other ideas UI Um what colour ID Oh yeah ID Latex covers PM We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on so well have to like have a little square or something so that the our logos available ID W I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though because if people are able to change the covers I dont know maybe the onoff button something some the menu button I dont know but you know if were gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one UI Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the RR like that ME Yeah UI And thats at the bottom of it UI Which button ID Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ID Every cover PM Yeah I dont think we should do that because that would just be icky ID Yeah PM So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea ID If we want it to be visible and Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silvermetallic looking UI Yeah ID But those are plastic right UI Yeah ID Theyre not titanium ID I kind of like that look ID Uh but or if it was really Yeah for the base or if were going for the retro look I think like a really shiny black would be cool PM For our base one ME Yeah or like a gunmetal grey cause then it combines the silver and the black ID What are your thoughts ID Gunmetal gray ID There you go gunmetal gray UI Im just really wary of the putting anything on a button ID Why PM Itll wear off UI Whats the button Well w w then whats the button do and how do you know that that is what the button does ME Yeah buttons wear off ID Mm UI I guess UI Just looking at examples y you just dont ever see the logo on a button its always on the actual casing ID Right ME Hmm PM Theres nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual The only problem is were using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be ME But we want it to be seen ID On the back UI But you dont But uh yeah you dont see it ID It d visible Visibility though Cause if it was only on the back really the only time youre gonna see it is when you drop it or when youre changing the battery ME We need it to be seen UI Well hang on UI The other option is I dont know if you can see it but its like if Yeah its like the second to last slide ID I can find it again ID Okay ID And yours was called Interface Concept UI Interface yeah ID This one UI Yeah ID Well for some reason I cant get it to just go to that slide directly UI Um UI Okay its the very right one UI You see at the bottom its kind of difficult to see but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like where the logo is and if we have the replaceable section its like the top UI It doesnt necessarily replace the entire top ID Mm UI And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in ID Okay yes yes UI If c you envisioning it UI And so that stays the same when you have the logo and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and thats the bit that changes ID Okay UI Hmm UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID Like a little cutout kind of Okay PM Yeah UI Right UI Thats like you know a a cellphone its like the the screen is always just left opened ME Right UI And so what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the RR ME Yeah ME Some of tho Well some of those buttons though are bluebased ID Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ME Um well a lot of those buttons are bluebased ID Mm ME Well kind of ID Mm ME Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact they could illuminate yellow UI Yellow ID Yellow I like that idea UI Yeah ME Like if we like the one all the way on the left uh you ca you can see it on your computer better ID Mm ME Um where the button is actually blue but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow ID Mm ME So wed have blue and yellow for the touch buttons UI Oh that one ID I like the yellow illumination idea very good ME Yeah ID Okay ID Any other ideas or thoughts ID We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so Kay UI Um UI Ha hang on Let me catch up ME Mm yeah UI Did we finalise what buttons were including or we just everything that we said before ID I think there will be time for that later ID Im guessing ID Kay well were gonna wrap this up ID Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes and heres what were each of us going to do ID The ID is going to do the look and feel design the UID the user interface design ID I think youre going to get a lot of I mean the final say on what buttons get put Well all talk about it but I think thats pretty much what youre gonna do right UI Yeah ID I guess ID Kay ID And youre gonna do some product evaluation ID Okay and right now the ID and UID you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay PM Great UI Fun PM Play Doh ID Yeah ID Okay and you should all be getting an email pretty soon ID Alright ID Well thank you for a very productive meeting PM Wonderful Ooh,"The Marketing Expert presented more information on user requirements which showed that users wanted the look of a high-tech device that was still simple to use. She presented the fruit and vegetable fashion trend that the group will integrate into their design. The User Interface Designer presented several ideas for the interface design taken from existing product designs. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and presented options for energy sources and materials. The User Interface Designer also presented the sample speaker technology recently developed by the company. The group had a discussion to finalize the prototype features. It was decided that the device will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand. Voice recognition will not be included outside of the locator function. It will be covered by interchangeable latex casings. To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through the latex casings. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to build the prototype, with the User Interface Designer deciding which buttons will be included. The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation."
ME I wanna find our if our remote works ID Me too ME Oh ID Okay ME Whoohoo ID Um heres the agenda for our last meeting ID Um after the opening were going to have a prototype presentation then were going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote ID Then were going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process and then were gonna close it up and we have forty minutes so lets get started ID Oh no lets have the prototype presentation PM Mm kay you ready UI Um sure UI You or me PM Y you read that stuff since you wrote it UI Okay UI Well since our materials arent exactly what we were going for Im just gonna translate what this all means for you PM Ill be the Vanna UI The base is gonna be gunmetal gray which is what we had decided and its gonna be plastic UI Um then theres the latex cover which is what you see as red UI Um because it can be replaceable we just kinda went with the colour ID Right UI Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top UI Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue almost seethrough ID Hmm UI Its just sort of a very pale blue and a lightup yellow ME Thats nice ID Yeah UI The whole thing lights up if you press any button rather than it just that one button will light up ME Good UI Um and then at the bottom we have our logo UI Um bright yellow sort of design with the RR which will actually look like our logo ID Great UI And then on the side you have the buttons UI Theyre one button but they kind of push up and down ID Okay UI I dont think theyre scrolling PM No PM Theyre just buttons UI Right yeah UI And then yeah the buttons PM On off switch will be here and as youve noticed on our prototype um theyve ended up with a curvature kind of by concave sort of thing except for you know cant see underneath ME Yeah PM So Im hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that because theyre very nice to stock you know stick your finger in ME Yeah PM Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used menu mute and then these are the numbers so our channel and our volume will be on either side UI Thumbshaped UI Yeah UI And then the last thing is just that itll be black labelling on top just which we didnt do ID Okay ID And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand is it gonna be a single or a double PM Id say a single ID Single UI Single ID Single sounds good cause its not big enough to really constitute a double ME Yeah UI Right PM Yeah its only actually the size of my hand ID Great ID Great ID I think you did an awesome job ME Yeah I think its a beautiful Yeah ID It is beautiful and its everything that we discussed ME Good job you guys ID Good job UI Oh thank you PM Whoohoo ME Those are really good ID Alright whats next in our agenda ID Um were gonna discuss the evaluation criteria and thats with Courtney ME Okay its a PowerPoint presentation ME I dont really know exactly what we should uh talk about ME Its under evaluation ID Right ME Alright ME Um so these are the criteria were gonna ask is it easy to use is it fashionable uh yeah I guess we should write these down so we can reference them ID Mm UI Feel good meaning what ME Like does it feel good like yeah physically UI Physically okay ID Right ID Sqi Right ME Thats just for current trend ME It doesnt really count you guys PM Yeah it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it ME Yeah ME But its so we do have removable covers right ID Right PM Yes ME Yeah well then thats covered ME And so we n k everybody have that ID Kay ID Ill wait ME Yeah shes got it ME Its good UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay so were using the criteria uh for a seven point scale and so we need to discuss how we feel ME It falls within this range so for easy to use do we feel its very easy to use ID Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say UI True or false easy to use ME You guys Okay ID Just orally UI Yeah ID Why not ID We have okay ID Um easy to use ID I vote six ME Oh wait thats false ID Oh two ME Okay PM Id say two as well UI Yeah two ME Two ID Uh hello were great ME Thats what I say ME Okay fashionable ID Um one PM At the moment no ME No ID No ME I mean like no I think its very fashionable ID Me too very chic ME I thi I would give it a one PM Okay ID One I give it a one PM Ill give it a two because at the moment its not looking that way ME Well thats thats just like thats a clay its a prototype ID Oh and ma its a prototype right ME What do you think UI Mm I dont think its that fashionable UI Id give it like three or four ID Well now Im ME Okay ID So the average is about a two ME Yeah its a two UI But then Im not fashionable so dont use my opinion ID Two or three ID Two point five ME Thats okay ME Yeah PM Neither are all o all the customers we have either ME Um does it feel good ID Imagine since we obviously dont have that ME I feel like I think it feels good UI Does it feel good PM Uh the shape of it actually does uh ID And its i it is very ergonomically designed ID Its gonna be curved UI Yeah its gonna be thicker ID Yeah UI Depth ID I think so too ME Ill give it a two ID Kay ID Two UI Ill give it a one ME What do you say PM Id say a two ID Alright average is two ME Okay ID Is it technologically innovative ID Oh sorry Im taking over your job here ME Oh no its fine youre I mean youre Project Manager ID Go right ahead ME Um yeah I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ID Yes ID Right ID We were able to do it with that kind of chip UI Oh right the Right PM We could do it with the chip yes PM It wasnt we have no reflection of it on the prototype but thats because its only two dimensions really ME And theres no way you can represent it on here ID Yeah right ME Y Yeah so ID That was kay ID And we discussed that being included ME Then yes then I would well it isnt what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative PM It Yeah ID Well we don have the you know we cant say channel and it changes the channel channel eight ME And it doesnt cover anything other then TV so Id probably give it a three ID Right ID Okay ME Even though it is for just a TV remote its uh very advanced ME But it is just a TV remote ID Yeah ID Id go for a three or four on that one so okay lets go for a three point five UI Yeah I go four PM Three and an half ID Alright and the last criteria is it is it um Well weve covered that with the trendy UI Squishy and fruity ME Well yeah so Id give it a two UI Its just trendy basically PM Its capable of being squishy and fruity ID Sure ID Capable ME Oh its very capable of being squishy and fruity ID Very capable UI Okay ID And its very important ME Yeah ID Kay there we go ME Okay next ID So ID Next ME So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner and uh hopefully well sell millions ME Good job team PM How did you get that in there ME What PM The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie ME It it does ID It does PM That was good ME Thanks ID Very good ID Alright lets go back to this No thats it ID Hmm ID Oops ID Okay so now uh were moving on to finance okay ID Im gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and were going to fill it in together based on what components were including in our remote and see if its under twelve fifty Euro ID If so we can proceed if not we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit ID Kay ID So let me bring that up ID Here we go ID Alright ID Um its not hand dynamo its powered by battery so we give it a Number of components you plan to use PM Yep ME Two ID Do I just put quantity being one battery or Yeah ME Yeah PM Mm kay ID But if its a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if its a lithium or do we wanna go triple As cause triple As were gonna have t do more than one battery ID Oh lets just go for a lithium ID What do you say ME Yeah lets lets do a lithium PM Yeah its ID I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right ME Were gon thats gon Nologically advanced yeah ID Okay down to the electronics um section ID Were gonna need this kind correct if we do the voice sensor so one of those ME Yeah PM Yep ID It is a singlecurved so one of those ME Uh ID Oh ID Whats that ID Yeah thats correct ME Yeah ID Kay down here case material UI Its plastic ME We plastic ID Plastic ME And special colour UI And special colour ID Kay ID Down here interface type ID Were gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel UI No we dont have the scroll ID Isnt oh those are just regular buttons ME But its Yeah but i so i But will we w actually well need two wont we PM Well thats the pushbutton too right there UI Buttons ID This PM Integrated scrollwheel or pushbutton PM Were really having just pushbutton interface ID Okay so we can just go um ME One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side PM But it that just covers the type of button were having PM Because were not doing a scroll on the side its still pushbutton UI Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and pushbuttons PM Pushbutton ME Okay ID Right I think shes I think what Courtneys talking about is do we need to put two here PM But we just have push Yeah UI But we dont have any scrolls ME Like because theres like one interface right here and then because its not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button ME Theres gonna have to be additional signals on the sides ID Right ME So is that gonna be an extra one on each side PM Okay ID I dont know they might put us well lets just UI Two interfaces is that what w should we s say PM Lets call it th Okay ID Two or would it be three ME Or three because of one on each side and one on top UI Okay fine UI Yeah ME I mean its fine cause it comes out the same as twenty nine ME Well less than twenty nine even ID Okay and were gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay ME Theyre a special colour ME Um theyre uh theyre a special form cause theyre indented ID Are they ID Oh right UI And then s yeah ME And theyre a special material ID Mm ID Well were under cost then ID Alright UI Were over ID No were under PM Grand ME Were under ID Twelve point five is our limit UI Okay UI Oh I see ID Weve got eleven point two PM So we can go to production ID Alright ID We can go to I dunno what I just did ID Okay ID Now were gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not were satisfied with the whole process and the result ID Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ID Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership um teamwork and the means meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there and if we found any new ideas ID Now question is how do we do this PM Go back ME I think we just discuss it ID Discuss sure PM Previous ID Alright ID Who want who would like to go first PM We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself in restricting us only to using a TV remote initially UI We didnt have a whiteboard ID Hmm UI Yeah ME Oh thats true ID Hmm UI And no internet ME Yeah ME No yeah thats a good point ME Cause Id forgotten that that wasnt our decision yeah ID And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ME Oh overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a TV remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it ID Right and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable which I kind of like we yep ME And were a fashion forward technology company ID You know it PM right ID Um what about um the teamwork aspect ID How did you guys enjoy making the model the prototype UI I think we did well PM Yeah ID I think ya did ID Did you work well together in there and kay UI Yep PM Well no there was there was scratching and fighting but no ME Minus that one fight ME Yeah ID Oh my God and weve all been a pretty congenial team here I think UI Gouges ME Yeah ID We hadnt had any ma fallings out ME I mean minus you guys being wha what is it the

Brother ME Yeah ID Kay have we found any new ideas through this process ME Um we are really gonna sell this ME Tada ID For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically UI Yeah ID And thats your right brain taking over w wanting the artistic the fashionable the hip you know ME Mmhmm ID If we all just went out and bought useful things I dont think I mean thats not what technology UI Well thats why I dont like uh Macs or Apples just cause I look at it and I know its probably a very good computer but I look at it and Im taken back to elementary school cause they look the same ID Mm UI They look like they did when I was in elementary school and thats so oldfashioned to me ME Yeah ME Yeah cause theyre pretty and just like Uh yeah PM The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids ID Yeah UI Exactly so I associate them with like really lowtech really cheap bad Yeah ID Yeah ID Just the Mac font bothers me even ID But I do like iPods go

Thatll sell ID There you go marketing UI Let you loose PM And so the serpent says use our remote ME Yeah ID Alright UI Yeah no ME Yeah ID Okay were gonna wrap this up now ID Um the costs are within the budget we evaluated the project and now were gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary and then were going to have a big giant party apparently according to this so PM Whoohoo ID Alright thank you team you did a great job it was lovely working with you PM Margaritas for everyone UI Good ME You too PM Yay PM Thanks to the Project Leader,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color, removable casing, buttons, logo, and ergonomic design. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote. The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project. The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected, at 11.2 Euros. The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries. The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process. The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype. They complained, though, that they felt constrained by the management's directives, that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment, and that they did not have internet access during the project. All participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire."
ID Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reactions uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control ID Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th thats possible for everybody uh one that everybody wants uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company ID Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that ID Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um Ill just go round th the table Andrew marketing um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design ME Mm ID Um ID Whats uh the the th th project is is here to do is is to to get this this project up and moving ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say ID Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else everybodys worked for the the company for a while if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybodys quite clear what everybody uh uh everybodys experience is please do so ID Uh in fact Id Id Id welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you youre looking to make ID So well start with Andrew ME Oh my names Andrew Im a Im the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah Ill be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view ID Right Kendra UI Im Kendra and Im the Us User Interface Designer and um I havent had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but Im m so Ill be working on the design ID Right at least means you havent got any preconceived ideas so UI Right UI Yep Im just open to being creative ID Yep good PM Uh Im Katie Im the Industrial Designer and Ill just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah ID Okay very very quickly um this I dont want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that its a um you know a think tank ID Everybody says what they what they want to say uh and we dont want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do ID The the remote control needs to be original there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls dont have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes thats different uh I want one um and that goes along with being trendy uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario ID Userfriendly as as we all know remote controls can be uh uh very userunfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes thats its obvious how that works uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah thats something that I may not need another remote control but uh its such a nice one Im gonna have one ID And last but not least or indeed first of all it it must make the company money and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants ID The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design uh what it uh what it must actually do the uh conceptual design uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production ID Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here um In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires that we dont do that um So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so well um uh well do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal but le lets go round the table your favourite animal ME Um badger ID Mm and why ME Uh its its got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel theyre underdog kind of status and theyre the Make mobile phones and TV remotes to make TV remotes ID Uhhuh ID Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badgers arse cause of the the white streaks in it ID Kendra UI Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and theyre just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever ID Uhhuh ID Right okay PM Uh s horses no particular reason why ID Uhhuh fair enough yeah ID Im not sure that Ive got any favourite animal to be quite honest I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh Sorry ID Indeed absolutely yes tha thats um Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so were were looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and were looking at a gross profit of fifty percent ID It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make ID Um so were not only looking at a a very trendy original product were looking at making it at a very good price ID Um okay um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls UI Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh its handiest when you have one that works both the DVD player or whatever and the TV as well UI Um but that its easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think its is best when theyre clearly labelled and you can see which buttons youre supposed to use you know ID No ID Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ID Or anybody else strong feelings about remote controls ID Are there you know bad ones theyve used or good ones theyve used or ones that theyve lost and never found again PM Um I think its important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons itll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldnt have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the TV to actually pick up the signal ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Think a lot of the time remotes that come with TV players and TVs and DV players like they arent like an area thats put a lot of effort into theyre very boring very plain PM Mm ME Like its very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition PM Mm ID Um what so wh whats in in what particular style features are you thinking about ME Um ME Something that looks looks doesnt look like remote control ME So if you want something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh whats this ME Like this pen doesnt really look like a pen but it makes you think oh ID Uhhuh ME So sorry thats a bit vague ID Yeah d no I mean do you think theres a risk if it doesnt look like remote control people wont see it as a remote control um and uh Uhhuh ME Uh I suppose suppose thats up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product ID Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls UI I think something thats comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big rectangular things and uh theyre kind of awkward to hold onto so something thats more comfortable that fits in a persons hand better PM Mm ME Mm ID I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but arent particularly comfortable PM Mm UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Mm UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh Yes I mean the only thing is if if youre watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily ME Well from the mouse idea you could remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see like a mouse button PM Mm ME I suppose ME Easily yeah yeah UI But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better ME Mm PM Mm ID Yeah thats uh must admit I dont think Ive ever seen one with concave buttons thats uh certainly be different ID Um do we need it to uh I cant think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all ID Do we do we want uh Yeah UI Oh yeah PM Mm that would be good UI Like a like a mobile phone PM Mm UI Yeah ME Mm yeah that would be good PM Mm ID Okay ID So Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ME Mmhmm um especially if we try to sell what two million of them ME Oh sorry four million of em but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where youve got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool is fashionable and like you just its its like uh its one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time PM Mm ID Mmhmm ME I think its this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh is practically sound ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME So um I dunno well have to decide which which angle were gonna go to or both ID Okay yeah yeah well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of ME If you ME Mm ID Um okay well first thoughts on um the the industrial design side PM Oh I think its its remote controls are kind of a unique object cause its you depend on them so much but you dont i i its you sort of just assume theyre always gonna work you dont think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and youre kinda like oh well fair enough theres all these complex things going on its gonna somethings gonna get messed up eventually PM They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks its God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective very always dependable ID Indeed PM Uh I dont think we should make it too small I cause I think it needs to it cant be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um its just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah ID Yeah PM But so yes dependable and have a good medium range size ID Okay and um colours materials ID Kendra anyone UI Well most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what theyre doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called UI Like the faceplates that you change so we could have maybe I dont know if it would be feasible to do something with that where you can change the faceplates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things ID Yeah PM Mm mmhmm ID Uhhuh UI Have it kind of look how they want to different colours things like that probably just plastic because thats always the lightest ID Right ID Yeah ID Okay thats uh Again I dont think thats ever been done before its uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes thats something that I havent got and uh might need so PM Mmhmm ID Uh Andrew any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ME Um well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the faceplates with it when you buy or as a separate thing but uh maybe thinking of that its considering the nature of the device maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it PM Mm ID Yeah ME Unless you were trying to Mm ID Yeah PM Well you could come up with like novelty ones like theyve done with the the mobile phones you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and thatll keep them spending money ID I think Mmmm UI Yeah ME Oh its thats a thats a good idea UI Yeah ME Mm ID Right okay I think weve got um a good idea now ME Yeah true ID We uh meeting is uh Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly ID So uh um weve got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail ID Um then well we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised ID Uh thank you very much indeed UI Okay PM Thank you,"The project manager opens the meeting by welcoming everybody and saying they will be developing a new television remote control. Then each group member states his/her name and role in the group. The project manager states that the remote needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The further work will be on the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Since they all know what a whiteboard is, they do a virtual drawing by each stating their favorite animal. The project manager tells them the project budget. They proceed to discuss problems with current remotes as well as preferable styles and looks, such as using face-plates so the look is changable. The project manager closes the meeting."
ID Okay welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group ID Um Ill briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I havent attributed anything to individuals because were working strictly as a team here and uh n nobodys working equally so uh UI Sorry ID Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour ID Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items that switching was easy that you shouldnt need to point the thing at uh anything in particular um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting that the keys might be concave simply because that hasnt been done before that we know of ID Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms ID Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls ID Um and that it sh it should just always work whenever you uh um mm uh use it ID And that it shouldnt be too small mm that it it gets lost ID Um ID Now uh uh Ill shortly ask for for three three presentations ID Uh before I do that however I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting ID Um the uh the ma the management has had its own thoughts on this and uh the they dont necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought ID Um and and then well as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh Anyway ID Okay ID Now the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet ID Um and and they want it only to cover televisions ID Um now what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they dont want it to cover teletext or whether they dont want it to cover you know videos DVDs um satellite boxes which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise ID The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only ID Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they dont look at teletext anymore they certainly do look at other things ID Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours ID Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there the the the two Rs in grey against uh a yellow background ID Um now this doesnt necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market ID But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that ID Um it also has to be simple which to some extent goes along w with the first one and that weve already said that it must be simple cause thats what people want anyway ID Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly which um mm uh is is is their choice but uh um we we need to talk that through ID Um okay so uh after the meeting itll be summarised and uh um notes sent out and uh etcetera ID Okay so well first of all mm have individual reports from everybody ID Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I Ill leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ME Uh I dont mind ID P fine ME Uh can I steal the cable ID Oh sorry you can indeed ME Cheers ME I got a how do I start there ID Oh if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen no the one to the right of that ME That one ID That one ME Cool ME Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab ME Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see ME Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often theyre used and how much their necessary and stuff ME And general opinions about current current remotes ME See that as we kinda noticed seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly ME So some kind of a new style should be incorporated thats less ugly ME Uh along with um looking less ugly if it looks better eighty percent of people said theyd spend more money on it ME Which is a a plus for us if we can make it look better itd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up ME Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user ME I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um they they dont uh they yeah they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat Ive got six remote controls for a stereo system a digital box a DVD player a video player and TV ME If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes arent really matched well to my behaviour ME Uh again seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot ME I took to mean that they just they use it a lot they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume ME And uh yeah uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well well have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext but uh oh and were going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings arent h hardly ever used and used very arent considered relevant by the user ME So I think maybe fewer buttons which also make the design look sleeker I dunno ME Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control ME I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the TV or maybe thats b it would have to incorporate but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control ID Mm ME Maybe like itll beep or something ME And um yep the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is Uh dont want to make it too complicated easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff ME And uh repetitive strain injury I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it yeah fewer buttons like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable ME Maybe dont even have to hold it as such ID Mm ID Gosh must be some telly addicts out there if they get RSI from their television remote is all I can say ME But uh yeah ME It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would ME And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh LCD displays but the data wasnt there so ME I dont actually know what the results for that were so ID Mm ID Right ID Mm ME May be incrementally emitting but yeah ID Yeah I must say that um the uh I c cant remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well so that is indeed a uh um a thought and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say you cant get a lot of RSI j just get jaw ache ME And uh it would cut out the RSI as well if you Yeah um oh yeah so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design ID Okay sorry ME Oh Ive got some other things I couldnt fit onto this presentation ME Um ME You see this okay ME Almost no ME Its sorry its a bit ME Ill read out to you ME Uh functionality uh like peoples opinions on functionality the relevance to the remote and how often theyre used ME So um like the power ME Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on TV is a high relevance of nine but its not frequently used ME You see what I mean ME Whereas channel selection which is very high relevance is used the most ID Yeah ID Mmhmm ME So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use ME Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something ME So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are low relevance and rarely used PM Mm ME And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily Oh yeah ID Mmhmm UI It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ID I mean Yeah UI Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting and then the numbers on one side so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something PM Mm ID Mm ID Hmm hmm PM Mm ME Yeah like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath ID Uh UI Yeah ID Should we actually bite the bullet here PM Mm ID If people really dont use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether ME Just remove them completely UI That might be the Maybe i Yeah have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the TV and then it doesnt matter where in the room you are you wont lose it ID We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that um the Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure what we didnt have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups ID Now do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group uh to put myself right in the middle of it um u use remote controls to a great extent ME Uh yeah ID Yes we That would ve speech recogn right ME Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition ID So were looking at um well again we dont know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups ME Yeah thats true ID If we wanted something different truly different then the buttonless remote control w would be it PM P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if youve got a lot of people that dont wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls PM If you just kind of take away everything that theyre used to knowing thats gonna be quite a change ID But if you just lift it up and say channel one or BBC It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the you know the sound from the television because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh you know ITV and youre watching BBC then then it might um change itself so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it PM It might Mm ME Or even I mean you could even just have it left on ME You could just put it down once on top your TV and never have to Yeah PM Mm UI No PM Yeah ME BBC one UI Oh PM Yeah UI Yeah thats true ME Oh yeah ID Or or something just to identify that youve lifted it up and its use ID And and then just say oh I dont know a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different UI Yeah ID Um cause uh you know audio settings nought point eight percent ID I mean if they werent there would people miss them ME Mmmm PM But look at the importance of them PM The volume settings ME Relevance of two out of ten yeah ID Vol volume yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and its a function of frequency and relevance PM Yeah PM Theyre not used often but they are quite important when theyre used PM Yeah ID And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment um the channel and volume and th w w given given that weve been told to ignore teletext PM Mm ME Yeah ID Uh channel and volume are the only ones that uh would appear to be essential ME Stand out ID Um ID So we if we can design something that that looks interesting know or looks different um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if its the yellow and grey um and uh I dunno buttons or or buttons as an option ME Uh I just had a thought actually sorry to interrupt ID Do please ME Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word ID Mmhmm ME Cause Ive seen Ive seen this used on computers before where you just you address the remote you address the computer and then give it a command ID You cer certainly could PM Mm ID Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say BBC one ME Oh I see ME Oh yeah I see ID Um okay I mean you could print actually print it on the uh device itself ME Mmhmm yeah ID Um ME I mean Im just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote ID S th this I th thats always gonna be a problem I think ME Mm ID Um and I I I s so I suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one ID Anyway sorry carry on ID Do you want to just carry on with or no no no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there ME Oh no I I interrupted you sorry ME Oh okay ME Um well I was just kinda wrapping up there ME Yeah I was thinking um yeah maybe such things are relevant ID Mm okay ME We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we dont really use much ME alright take out teletext but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away ME But since if were marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then itd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality ID Mmhmm ID S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um cause were Certainly could ME Oh we could yeah ME We c yeah we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time so ME So uh yeah if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection wouldnt have to really Yeah and probably it would look better as well PM Mm ID Yeah yeah ID The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper ID No it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh you know visually very distinctive ME Yeah ID Um cause you know it does not have to be a oblong box ME yeah PM Mm ME Lined with numbered buttons and Uh yeah yeah thats everything ID Mm yeah ID Okay who sorry have you have you finished there Andy ID Yep yep ID Um given that weve already had a extensive discussion uh UI Okay well I can do mine PM Hmm ME Do you want the cable UI Yeah lets see if I can make this work UI Um PM Oh you have to hit like function and F something UI Oh ME F eight PM F eight UI Is it doing Okay PM Dunno ME Uh give it about twenty seconds or so ID Ah there we go PM Oh yeah its going UI Oh okay UI Okay so this is just about the technical functions ID Alright UI So the method I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do UI Um and then there are two different kinds that I found UI Theres a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be ID Mmhmm UI So these are the two different ones UI This one um this is the user centred it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred which has a lot more buttons and probably this is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you dont use ID Mmhmm UI So basically what a remote control is is you its to send messages to the television set you know turn on off switch the channels and the volume and things such as that UI And so for this product its gonna be television only and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours UI And so for my personal preferences I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know fewer buttons UI Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have UI It looks kind of narrow at the top and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top then that would be easier ID Mm yeah UI Um and so we have to decide whats gonna make our product different UI E the unique style maybe have it light up so its visible in the dark um the changeable faceplates and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that so its easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that UI So thats my presentation UI Yeah ID Okay can I um Im actually gonna use the um its gonna cause great technical problems over here ID Im actually gonna use the Yes rather than the uh the the traditional in fact um I wont even go that far UI F they probably clip to you PM Oh yeah they might be movable ME Yeah PM Oh yeah theyre all theyre not connected to anything on the table you just leave em on and walk around with em ID Um something like this shape you know sort of something that you can thats sort of a more vertical shape um that you you sort of hold in your hand um well Im trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that possibly with a couple of buttons like that but with the the entire top with the you know the uh the infrared or whatever source PM Mm ID Uh so that you know its flying off in all directions so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the you know the power requirements of the uh such a source um you know compromise the our our need for uh you know it it being um mm permanently uh you know available PM Mm ID Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared and like they have been for a long time ID Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different um you know short range not like the old uh radio remote controls where youd change next doors telly when you change yours ID Um but uh uh I think basically i if were going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority then we should as I say r know really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum you know possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off ID Um and nothing else ID Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that but again except that um you know the risk of losing it ID Um anyway okay um so Kate wh what are your uh your thoughts on this PM Yes mm UI Oh PM Which one does this plug into UI Hmm I think its all there PM That one UI H Oh yeah PM I cant did you could you see it on you screen when it Thats not cool UI Thats kind of strange PM Oh well PM Anyways PM Um alright yeah so um Ill just do my presentation on the working design uh PM Oh there we go PM Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works PM Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system the the TV or the DVD player or whatever PM Um and it does this uh by well you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television the DVD to tell that what to do PM Um and you need a user interface which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is thats basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it PM Um Oh shoot PM Okay PM Uh just general findings PM Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source uh some sort of user interface which I think weve mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that PM Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver PM And um oops PM Uhhuh PM This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what were looking for PM Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so itll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons ME Hmm PM Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb which will be the part that actually what PM Sends signals to the the television PM And then youve got your happy little TV watcher there PM And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that wont die out uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in so itd constantly be charged so you wouldnt have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you PM Uh a wide range uh senderreceiver so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the channelll still be changed PM Uh also definitely a userfriendly interface um and I think weve all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions as they inevitably do you can find them easily PM And thats pretty much it ID Okay ID Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one PM Mm PM Mm ID Um I dont suppose weve got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls particularly sort of independent ones ID Um given you know the number of things you buy these days which you know have a a a lithium whatever battery in thats uh you know never needs replacing ID Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control uh um you know one some sort of typical usage ID You know the the the battery will last know five ten years ID By which time I mean when alls said and done the digital television will be taking over in that time scale PM Mm ME Mmhmm ID Um uh uh p perhaps we should know reduce the uh you know the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh Yeah and if if anybody manages to run it down well well give em a new one PM Just having one thats guaranteed to last five to ten years PM Oh cool PM Yeah fair enough ID Um its you know its what it saves in cost and you know there theres a well its actually a marketing gimmick ID I mean its hardly a gimmick its uh its totally practical ID Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless youre really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if its n by you know magnetic waves or whatever if if it Yeah ME It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time PM Mm mm ID Are are people really gonna use it though ME I suppose yeah UI Yeah people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there so ID Um PM Mm yeah ID I I th I think Yeah its um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then shes had those for so long that if she hasnt worked that out by now PM Mmmm ME Yeah PM Mm ID Um PM Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies PM And thats pretty much yeah UI Yeah ID When it yeah wh when its died is a problem PM Yeah when it turns itself off thats when I plug it in yeah ID Yeah yeah yeah so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery PM Yeah think thats a good idea ME Uh ME That sounds pretty good yeah UI No ID Is the uh you know we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here UI Um PM Mm ID Um you know cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know if we have a high tech interior then then that that sh may well be cost effective UI Do they make batteries that last that long ID I mean th th certainly ID Um I cant think of anything off the s top of my head but there are certainly things that you buy ID I mean calculators for example PM They usually have the little light uh source I dunno what the heck theyre called the but yeah the little cells that Yeah UI Yeah they have that little solar Yeah ID Som well some do I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know sort of permanently sealed ME Mmhmm PM Mm ID In in fact Id Yeah uh uh Yeah I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit PM Most of them dont they have sort of a combination of the two like when there is light theyll work off the light and if there isnt theyll kick into this battery so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery but if theres enough light then its using the light so that its not actually draining the battery all the time but you will have the battery there for when you need it UI Mm PM Mm ID I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably you know no more than minutes in its entire life PM Mm PM Oh it depend if its uh depends who whos using it whos just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking yeah ID Um UI Yeah some people are Yeah ID If but I say if if people are getting RSI from it then uh then uh then then perhaps were looking at the wrong market n Right PM Yeah then theyre clicking a lot yeah UI Yeah ME W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that its used channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour PM Yeah UI Per hour UI Wow ME Yeah UI Thats a lot PM Yeah ID Oh I must admit I hadnt um Id Id missed that ID That does sound excessive ME But then again if you think it of the amount of you know amount of use its like Thats its less than a second um ID Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Well thats right and and I I dont I dont even know whether the I dont even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed or whether its just a sorta tenth of a second no matter how long you press it for I dont know I dont actually know PM Mm ME Yeah UI Though I think with digital TV like I know on my cable box youre not supposed to do that because the channel cant keep up with it if you just press it like that so youre supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uhoh ID Um ID Yeah PM Mm ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Mm ID Right so Ive got a message to say five minutes I dunno how long ago that appeared ID Um cause were were getting um right so Id I need to sum up very quickly here um ID Were looking at extreme simplicity ID Were looking at a radically different shape ID Possibly no buttons at all um but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design then then thats fine ID Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here because you know shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint ID But we clearly only need th the main buttons although uh if clearly only need the main functions ID Um I dont see why we shouldnt go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control volume control and on off ID Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and theres no reason why we cant introduce um interchangeable uh covers ID Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what weve discussed ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Yep PM Hmm ID Right UI Um Oh I just have one question ID So uh Yeah UI So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not DVD players we okay okay ID We are doing just the television ID No ID I think thats quite clear from the the information that weve been given no PM Mm UI Okay ME Yeah like in the email of television only ME In fact theyre in the constraints email that I got ID Right ME Didnt you mention the teletext just television only ID Oh yeah well th thats one I s thats one I sent you which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office PM Mm UI Yeah ME Oh okay PM Yeah ME Oh yeah UI Oh okay PM Okay ID Um Thats that that that thats their uh their view ID Okay so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting thank you very much indeed UI Okay PM Cool,"The project manager opens the meeting by going through notes from the last meeting, recapping the topics covered. He tells them some new project requirements given by management. The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people. They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions. The interface specialist presents, showing examples of two different products- one that is user-centered and another that is engineering-centered and giving personal preference to the simpler one because it is easier to use and has fewer buttons. Next the industrial designer presents, explaining how a remote control works and giving personal preference to a remote which has a large energy source such as a rechargable battery or battery dock. The group discusses using a battery that will last 5-10 years or a solar combined with a battery. They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting."
ID Alright ID Alright ID Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group ID Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control ID Um Ill again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting ID Um the the the problem with existing remote controls we felt was that theyre ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better ID Um theyve got lots of buttons on them that uh people dont use and find difficult to learn ID Um and people lose them ID And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy um that were we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use ID That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable A um as uh a trendy remote control and and B as uh a Real Reaction product ID So that w uh when people are uh happy with that they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us ID Uh Okay ID So again um Ill well have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh well well make a a final a final uh decision ID Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today finally are um what energy source we want to use whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one ID And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if were gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply then basically its uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down well well give them another one ID And uh it itll be uh you know prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that its um um you know for life guaranteed for life ID Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kates expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ID Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ID Uh I mean Im Im Im n not an expert on these things but presumably there must be loads of em already on the market that we can modify ID But uh that thats uh thats your area of expertise ID And then the uh you know the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendras field and uh we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and well well finalise those uh da today ID Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface whether we p um go for voice buttons or or a bit of both ID Uh and then uh you know f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look feel and design Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation ID And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at ID Uh so if if we can have the the three presentations again please and uh um p perhaps youd like to start uh k PM Okay ID Kate PM Um Um p there we go ID Oh Im sorry oh sorry PM Kay Ill just be talking about the components design PM And Okay basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do PM Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the TV PM Uh the materials were gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor PM Um PM Uh basically what happens is youll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format PM This signals sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the TV and sort of seen by the TV and which uh changes the channels PM Um PM Oh PM Uh cool PM Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons PM Uh y the fewer buttons you have I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes youre gonna need PM Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost PM Thats something we should think about PM Also we have to work within the company constraints and the company has informed me via email that uh theyre experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh costeffective way of producing it PM Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a backup basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea PM Um we also need to look at the chips uh v customdesigned versus off the shelf and the customdesigned will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon PM Um however thats gonna cost more but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and its gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster but its going to be less flexible with the features especially things like uh voice activation which havent really been used much on remotes so theres not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option wed probably have to design um our own chip PM And that pretty much sums it up ID Okay so how um sorry can you uh just put that one back up again please PM Mm PM Oh yep sorry PM Yep ID Um ID Uh d d d okay I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive PM Mm ID Do we do we know uh by how much PM Um I dont actually have any price information no ID And and do we know how long itll take to uh develop a a custom chip PM Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip PM Oh w yeah we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed its sort of still still in an ex experimental form uh so it would uh its hard to predict the time ID Right okay ID Right I think we need to make a a decision here ID Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology PM Mm ID Um uh now before we go round everybody else does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that UI I I just have a question about that UI Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands for example if you um can preprogramme in like numbers one through ten and preprogramme say you know nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then youve programmed in say BBC four as your channel one as your favourite its like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w Okay PM W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick PM Once youve got the whole voice chip in there then its pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working UI Then it doesnt matter UI Okay UI Okay ID Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that you know mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling ID So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no I mean its if you you speak somebodys name and itll dial the number for you so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information is it UI Yeah PM Uh bits of it yeah ID So uh Yeah mm true again but if its without any without any uh p price informations thats uh difficult to uh uh decide UI Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive you know hundred and fifty pounds or something PM Yes as well UI As opposed to the twenty Euros twenty five Euros UI Yeah ME Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them not just that so PM Mm ID Yeah thats thats right ID Its like its its you cant cause mobile phones are expensive you cant say its the voice recognition bit that is UI Yeah ID But we dont know ID Um ID I mean uh I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that its its never been done before um th th the double risk uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesnt work ID Um ID Thoughts UI Well another thought I oh sorry go ahead ME Would Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost ID I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project PM Uh its fundament well I mean I guess it its something weve discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning so I th I think in in our in our minds its its fundamental but I dont know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that so I think you have to Hm ID I mean I think we Mm UI Oh yeah UI Okay UI Well I kinda think if were gonna have the voice recognition for part of it then maybe we should have it for the whole thing ID Yeah I I I I I think thats uh Yeah yeah PM Mm UI And weve been talking about it the whole time PM Mm mm UI Anyway Im Im incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it ID Mm right okay PM Mm ME Uh yeah its the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative UI Yeah ME From uh my presentation show so ID Yeah it should be Right okay so ME Uh technologically innovative PM No that sounds good ID Fine ID Okay PM Mm ID I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we cant afford buttons but I mean b b second question do we need the five buttons for channel change up down volume up down and on off just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons PM Mm UI Okay PM Cool PM Um Yeah I I would say we do yeah UI Yeah UI I think so ID Right ID Okay ID Sorry d did you want to say anything PM Uh nope that was it that was it ID No ID Okay ID Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra PM Okay UI Okay ID Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over UI Lets see ID Mm ID Oh good UI Oh UI Yes UI Is it gonna work PM Yeah its thinking about it ID Mm yeah itll get there ID Yep UI Okay PM Yeah UI Okay so I did some research on the internet and um what you know the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users um commands and mechanisms for the operation and therere just kind of a variety of choices UI Um findings so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual ID Mmhmm UI Therere some special ones available like this one right here which is marketed towards children um different designs and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like ID Mm yeah ID Uhhuh ID Alright UI So just kind of minimise the clutter avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button like you have on a mouse that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume for example have the slide button on the side and then you can preprogramme the channels the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator ID Mmhmm ME Mm ID Mm yeah ID Sorry y y yeah if I can interrupt you ID Well d p kay do you wanna say anything about um slide controls PM Mm ID I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that theyre theyre si simple cheap and reliable PM Uh Uh I think theyre theyre about the same cost really PM I I mean I think its just sort of the the theres a lot of slide buttons out there PM I think its pretty much the same sort of connection ID Okay fair enough fine PM Mm yeah UI Just because I n for example if Im using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing PM Mm ID Yeah ID Good good ID Yeah ID So three three theres three buttons on a slider ID Three buttons channel up channel up down and Uhhuh UI Y yes yes ME Well if you g if you if you got a channel up down we can have a slider in that as well ME Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks if you know what I mean up like one unit if you see what I mean UI Yeah PM Mm ME So it kinda goes up one then y like you can keep rolling it up but its like like like like a cog or something ME So you kinda take it up one at a time ID Okay UI The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons like the buttons on one side for the channel and then the slider is that if youre just holding in your hand and you pick it up its easy to n s know okay this is just the volume and this is the channel ME D Oh ID Um Mmhmm ID This one on the one side and one yeah ME Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could Yeah like the shape of it almost like a mouse with a Dep I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it cause you could have like I dunno it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb and then you could control the buttons with your fingers PM Ye yeah cause Ive definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume or vice versa so itd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different ID Okay ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah PM Youd know what you were fiddling with PM Yeah ID Yeah or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what its going to do UI That was Yeah PM Mm ID Okay so we were looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change of one sort UI Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume but what what do you guys think ID Just for the volume uh PM Mm UI We could Yeah yeah PM Yeah cause if yeah in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling just the way it would Mm yeah yeah yeah ID Fingers yeah ID I mean its its It yeah I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different um that theres no no possibility of uh confusing the two UI B Yeah UI Yeah ME Oh yeah yeah ID So okay UI Im just gonna pass this along ID Right so uh thats sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay fine UI Yes UI Yeah ID Mm right ME Here we go ID Right ME Uh yeah this is my report on trend watching ID Mmhmm ME The datas come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer ME And we got reports from Paris Milan on new fashions ME And uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy look and feel uh instead of the current functional look and feel ID Mmhmm ME This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it ID Mm ME So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given we have to try and incorporate so uh Uh exactly yeah ID Well I I mean I th I think that what were suggesting ought to address all three of those UI Yeah PM Mm ID Okay ME I s that out of sequence ME Uh yeah sorry ME Uh yeah and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes et cetera UI Oh ME Uh sorry clothes shoes and furniture and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside ID Uhhuh ID Mm I hadnt thought of that thats different certainly PM Mm ME Yeah ME But uh I was gonna say um yeah fruit and vegetables uh important to this year um important to furniture Im just gonna say uh f like its in if if fashion if were going for the it looks fancy then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through ID What ID Yeah PM Mmhmm ME But fashions do dont last very long PM Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year we can have the face plates yeah ME Mm ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and A kind of yeah PM Yeah yeah ID Uh UI Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights UI You know that kind of spongy yeah PM Mm yeah that weird I dunno what that is but yeah ID Uh PM Mm ID Also means you can drop it without damaging it ME Oh Yeah PM Uh yeah its good as well ME Thats c cool UI Yeah thats true PM Mmhmm ME Um you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself you know could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ME Instead of having a ten year guarantee ME With interchangeable covers could just buy a new one every year a new one when new fashions come out UI Yeah PM Mm ID I I mean it its uh I thats an interesting idea its like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion but its just never been seen as a a fashion item before PM Mm ME Yeah ID Um thats yes if if if theyre made in sufficient quantity W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last you know a long time UI Wh What if we included the batteries in the cover PM I I think its easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one because you dont feel like youre investing in a whole new product PM Yeah PM Mm PM Yeah ID Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it its its even better PM Mm PM Mm ME Mmhmm PM Oh yeah UI So um like Yeah so can I see that thing PM I like that PM That all c also kind of encourages em to buy new covers and yeah PM Um ID S Yeah yeah I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y youve then got the connection and youve immediately got a sort of unreliability whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all you know completely soldered together and it it it you know total reliability but I mean I d I I uh I know what youre saying and uh understand where youre coming from UI Just this as examples UI So f Yeah I guess thats true PM Uh yeah PM Mm ME Or well but like uh like more than just the battery like a complete different like youve only got like you know like th uh this bits the bit you keep and this is the expensive bit this is like the chip and this is the microphone PM Mmhmm ME And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees ME And then Yeah you probably are right ID I th I s I think if were gonna go down that route then were talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that um just building the whole thing in one then having getting cheaper production costs um and you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they dont it doesnt have a cover on at all it will still work um totally PM Mm UI Yeah thats true PM Mm ID Um then if you know if people lose the cover I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah PM Well that thats just it with the covers youre sort of tricking em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making em feel like theyre being ripped off having to buy a new product UI Yeah ID Yeah I mean it is its up to its up to Yeah its its up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item UI Yeah just another five Euro to get Right PM So yeah PM Yeah PM Mm PM Mm yeah ID Um and you know as as external fashions change then we get new new covers on the market and you know readily available PM Mm UI Yeah ID And um thats thats right yeah yeah PM And thats the sort of thing once you get the mould set you can just whip out different colours different pictures very very quickly UI Yeah like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours PM Yeah yeah exactly exactly PM Yeah UI Yeah okay ID So uh i so uh okay ID Um right sorry ID Um we hadnt finished your Its the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me ME Um oh dont worry its all said I was just gonna say uh yeah are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture so are we gonna make this part of the furniture PM Mm PM Mmhmm ID Um this is fashionable ME Yeah ME This is fashionable with Oh yeah PM Yeah ID I you know Im Im Im with it Im up to date ID And you know th the the design that Ive got and and it could be a a homemade design um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control this is you know a fashion accessory ID Um so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that weve got you know one one on off button presumably two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing PM Mm ID And know whether we go down the fruit and veg route and I dont suggest we make it look like a banana but um know sort of the the organic you know curved look you know t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and you know whether whether the you know the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow PM Mm ID Um mm or uh cause theres certainly you know the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right thats a Real Reaction remote control I want one of those PM I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a youd have like a yellow circle with the RR in it somewhere on it but Id yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour ID Yeah uh the the uh or or b Yeah Id Id um yeah UI Yeah like an UI Yeah ID Uh no I d I I agree I mean were were were simply its simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um PM Yeah yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Mm ME And make that a fashion symbol as well UI Well n Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape thats almost like a mouse ID Well th this is this is the whole point yes you know Im Ive got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever ID And uh then people you know people demand more Real Reaction stuff PM Mmhmm PM Mm ID Yeah UI So that you know when they hold it its because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power wherever somewhere PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Mm ID Yeah PM Yeah UI I mean that was just an idea that I had ID I mean Ive uh yeah ID Oh no that well theres the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it UI Yeah UI Yeah maybe PM Yeah youd want it narrower than a mouse though cause it a mouse youre kinda just resting on it you want something you can definitely grip UI Kind of a c Yeah ID W it I mean well its sort of its its sort of uh a a mouse but held you know so its you sorta hold it in your hand like that i with you know and fiddling with the buttons PM So maybe itd be Yeah yeah UI Sort of a combination PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah and fiddle around with it and press it UI Yeah so yeah kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this cause this is pretty comfortable to hold and then if you had Yeah then wider up here PM Maybe almost like a hairbrush like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah UI And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light the infrared light at the TV and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever up up the top or something PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Mm PM Yeah cool UI What do you guys think about that ME Yeah that sounds Um Im just Im suddenly realising that yeah were discussing how much how good its gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to ID Okay yeah yeah ME I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it UI Oh yeah PM Yeah ID Its a very good point UI It is a very good point PM Yeah ID I think we d I think we decided that w were actually going down both routes PM Yeah yeah UI Yeah ID That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form but that uh yeah UI Yeah PM But do you know this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice cause if youre youre holding it and youre fiddling but you can also bring it up like that and its microphoneesque yeah yeah ID Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it yeah yeah UI Yeah and just say Yeah I suppose I sup So I guess we could have a menu button as well ME Yeah maybe we cou like w like were leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice PM Mm ID I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if its not there people wouldnt use it anyway um ME Mm I suppose but t there is the off chance that you know th the brightness is wrong on your TV or the contrast needs changing ID Its cer its certainly possible I mean but they we were going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um PM Bu Mm ME Hmm yeah PM Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons PM I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those you know brightness and tint and stuff ID Uh Yeah ME Yeah thats a good idea ME Yeah ID If we were I mean Im getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available PM Yeah Yeah UI We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume UI So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume ID Uh uh uh Okay if we if were going down that route then we need some sort of display ID Do we need some sort of display PM But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness and youd use the scroll scroll through it yeah UI Yeah thats on the TV yeah ID We actually use the television okay UI Yeah and then y Yeah press that is t yeah that might work ID Okay okay okay ME Well I mean on a onto like a mouse the ru the scrolling button is actually a button as well you could press it you could press that and have it as a menu button ID Yep PM Yeah yeah thats true PM I never understood how that worked though but yeah UI Yeah its like um yeah its like the mouse where you just kinda click it PM Yeah mm UI You just press it UI Yeah and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select PM Mm oka yeah PM Yeah ME Uh yeah UI You know what I mean ID Mm yeah ID Okay we got five minutes to go in this meeting so um I d I think weve actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um UI Okay PM Cool ID So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or playdough whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic PM Play with playdough ME Hmm ID Um and actually put what weve discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete but thats a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control ME Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake ID Yeah certainly of course ME Our energy source is gonna be long term ID I think I think we decided that were gonna for for simplicity of you know manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um I you know on the basis that um that you know if were going for making it a fashion statement then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh well say at least five five ten years and that well w we will guarantee it for for five years um PM Mm ME Cool ME Uh And were having a custom chip PM Yeah ID Were having a a custom chip but given the the weve cut the functions down um that will hopefully not be too problematic but given that um technol technological innovation is important then we need to Ill say it again technologically innovate ID Um and uh we we know we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um ME And interchangeable case ID I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept PM Mm ID Um it it should be cheap you know if if we avoid any you know electrical connections PM Mm UI Yeah ID And uh i you know i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new ME Mm mmhmm ID We d we dont know whether that to what extent people do it or not but if theyve at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway and uh and if if we can keep them you know rolling then uh you know so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets I wont mention any mention any names um its uh its good for the supermarket and its good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better ME And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or Cool ID Um the that I mean thats no because weve got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant UI Yeah I think so too PM Mm does actually yeah yeah UI Yeah and especially for making them so like different and Yeah PM Mm different to feel yeah yeah ID Yeah yeah ID And the you know that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life cause that would well that would clobber the battery life so no I mean given the nature of the buttons were having its actually uh uh unnecessary I think PM Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Yep yeah PM Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ME Are we having it that its any angle or is it just As wide as possible ID As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current so that if youre holding it you know anyway like youre likely to and uh its uh you know i i it will work most of the time um PM Yeah UI Like this or like this PM Mm yeah ID Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesnt work ID Um yeah I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh UI Yeah kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go PM Mmhmm PM Yeah mm ID Um so Yeah cause I mean the r reality is people are theyre gonna be looking at the television whilst theyre using it the chances are so if if theyre holding it anyway the theyre reasonably likely to be holding it to use it then uh then that thats the sort of coverage that we want PM Mm UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Um okay d were all clear where we go from here PM Yep sounds good UI Yep ME Mmhmm ID Okay so thank you very much indeed and Ill s see you all again in thirty minutes PM Kay UI Okay PM Kay,"The project manager opens the meeting by recapping the discussions of the previous meeting, telling the group this meeting's agenda, and stating what each person will do for the next meeting. Then the industrial designer talks about the components design and explains exactly what remotes do and how they operate. He also talks about batteries and chips. The interface specialist present research from the internet about user interface. He talks about minimizing the clutter on the remote, and suggests using a slide button like on a mouse. The marketing expert presents, talking about trend-watching and how fruits and vegetables are currently an important theme. They talk about making changable colors available and possibly including batteries with them. They discuss what the remote should look like in terms of shape color, and then talk about components, materials, and energy sources. Then they close the meeting."
ID Right well ID Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like weve uh done a good job here and uh well just go through the the final uh the final details ID Um okay oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think well take those as read um Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we well have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close ID Um So f if if youd like to uh present your your proposals PM Uh okay we basically have the same kinda layout here its just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand basically PM Um on the left weve got the scroll for the volume on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll or you can hold it and and push PM Uh this is the power key um its kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on ID Uhhuh PM Uh thats the little menu key PM This is the infrared section so you g itll be sending rays and if youre you know pointing it like that it can send it or if you hold it up like that itll send it ID Yep yeah good good PM Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and itll still understand ID Uhhuh ID Yep right PM Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bits the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then theres holes for the buttons to come through ID Uhhuh UI Mm UI S And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic just kind of a light nondescript grey so that peoplell wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers so they kinda just stretch over ID Yep yep mmhmm PM Um PM Mm ID Uhhuh ID Yep yep ID Yep PM Mm ID showing me age I dont know what i c iPod covers are like UI Yeah well I I didnt know that but yeah theyre kind of its just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and itll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the RR ID Yeah yeah ID Uhhuh PM Yeah ID Okay yep right PM Mmhmm PM But its also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you ID Okay PM This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and itll be fine ID Yep ID Okay good yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Yep right PM Li thatll be the covers as well yeah yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah yeah ID I mean tha its its a detailed point I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder UI Like that ID Right ID Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that theyd put them down vertically but uh uh Yeah uh no because particularly if theyve dif if theyre gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it its uh it its just I mean its just a minor detailed point but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if theyve got them um because actually have several upon the uh Yeah well PM Yeah it could stand yeah UI Oh PM Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that PM Yeah standing PM Yeah we could just widen it out uh Mm PM Mm ME Could have one for your stereo one for your DV player PM Mm yeah yeah UI Yeah PM Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there UI Yeah just kind of Or just make it little ID Yeah but that thats uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah no no I mean thats these uh Yeah PM Yeah mm UI Somewhere like that so it just sort of Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there yeah yeah yeah like that like that ME Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea where its like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner yeah kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda Uh yeah just click there PM Yeah UI Bu ID But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the Yeah yeah yeah I mean it its uh wouldnt wouldnt do that indeed yeah PM Mm UI fall over PM The final product would actually stand up yeah UI Yeah ID But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different PM Yeah yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah UI S a little longer PM Wee Mm UI Yeah ID Um so good thats that thats excellent ID Um right let us um Whats on the next one ID Oh right yes lets have a look at the um f finance ID Um now were given a a clear design brief uh if I get the uh spreadsheet up ID Oh ME Uh the the maximise button ID Oh right ID Ah ID Good this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand ID Now Ive um this is the companys uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I Ive treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us um I wouldnt know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours then that is not a special colour thats a thats a standard colour ID Uh so were just simply on batteries the the one th the one decision Ive had to make is that um were we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um Im Im Im certain that they they are around so um that I dont think is a a serious problem ID The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay ID Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that its its expensive to uh um l to make cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets ID Um its simply made of plastic so th thats uh thats no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing thats uh uh theres some cost there ID Um and uh we havent actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do dont know that theyre special colour ID Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what weve got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we cant operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give so uh we we we present this as the uh the companys uh the the companys way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget PM Mm PM Mm ID Um ID Okay uh ID So um ID Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where were where where were at ME Evaluation ME The the product or the project ID The the the well the I meant the product ME Um well well my presentation just now ID Yeah ME Sure uh can I get the Cheers ID Oh sorry yeah um mm ID Mm ID More loud clicks in the microphone ME There we go oh ME Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve from the point of view of the the consumer and the management ME So what Ive been asked to do is on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions ME So on a scale of one to seven one being true and seven being being false ID Seven being a nice round number to work to ME Yeah ME And then at the end just take an average Yes ID Tr On for true and seven for flase ID Yes ME So uh ME So look at these questions ME Is the device f flashy and fashionable ID Well I think most definitely PM Yeah Id say definitely a one yeah UI I think it is yeah ME So uh and also uh technologically innovative ID Yes the voice technology indeed PM Yeah defi yeah yeah Yeah UI Yeah ME Easy to use ID I dont see we couldve made it any easier UI Yeah ME Uh suitable for the consumer ME That was um Yeah ID Totally PM Yeah definitely UI Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants PM Yeah ME Uh is it complicated ID No UI No ME Doing pretty well so far arent we ME Uh functional ID Yeah PM Yeah definitely UI Yeah ME Um ME Where are we ID found easily ME Weve b built in the the speech where are you function ID yeah I mean thats thats Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah mmhmm UI Yeah ME Uhhuh ID Does it take long to learn to use ID Shouldnt PM No not at all ME Mmhmm ME And uh what else ME The RSI compares to the current standards well ID Less buttons so it must be PM Uh Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well ME We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to Um will device appeal to all age groups UI Yeah ID So yeah um um PM yeah ID I think it will because I mean uh old older people who cant manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so And its its its well I dont think were actually charging a particular premium anyway in the end so Yeah PM Mm UI I think so ME Yeah uh thats a good call yeah PM Mm ME Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality the e ease of use of the device might make up for that PM Mm PM I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody yeah ME Mm UI Yeah ID Yeah ID It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but its its uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I Yeah so I think we can reasonably say its another another one why not UI Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Mm ME Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ME Uh yeah and what h did we make the managements Um ID in in in in my interpretation of managements instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t its television only its its simple to use um its its its within budget um I its uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue PM Yep PM Mmhmm UI Under the cost PM Mmhmm PM Yep ID So uh I I think weve done an amazing job in uh coming up with what Need a need a calculator for that PM Yep ME Okay PM Well done us ME So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven ME Eleven divided by elevens one so equals average of one UI Yeah ME And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product PM Excellent ID Okay nick the cable back then UI I mixed up the colours a little bit PM Oh no thats Uh UI I think I all wrong ID Ooh ID Right do um either of you want to uh say anything ID Mm UI Mm ID Before I uh No UI Ps I dont think so I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah PM Mmhmm ID Well thats right I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity I mean I think weve allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows PM Mm PM Yeah definitely ID Um I wont comment on leadership uh teamwork I think weve uh I think everybodys uh worked pretty well together PM Mmhmm ID Um weve just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found um again gi no given relatively everyday product I think weve v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach PM Mm UI Yeah PM Yep ID Um are the costs within budget ID Yes ID Is the project evaluated ID Were were all happy that it it meets all the criteria um Thank you very much indeed I think that I think thats uh I think we can go f for an early bath PM Yep UI Alright UI Yeah ID So I call the meeting closed UI Okay ID Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there,"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. Then the industrial designer and interface specialist present the prototype, showing where they placed each button, function, and the company logo. Then they talk about the material they chose, which is light gray colored and light weight plastic so that people will want to buy covers. Next they take a brief look at the finance by examining the materials used, chip required, shape, and color. They are exactly on target at twelve point five. Next the marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and the group talks about whether the device is flashy and fashionable, technologically innovative, easy to use, suitable for the consumer, complicated, how long it would take to learn to use it, and its appeal to all age groups. They come up with an average of 1 for the evaluation. They briefly discuss the project process and agree that they worked well together, had excellent teamwork, and created an effective product that meets the budget cost. They close the meeting by thanking one another."
ME Is this okay ID Uh yeah ID Fine now ID Oh its not liking us it went thataway ID Computer adjusting ID Oh ID Uh ID Okay ID So ID Right ID You ready back there ID Uh okay ID Welcome everyone ID Um this is the kickoff meeting for the day ID Um were the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction ID As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting um become acquainted with each other um have a little training on tools uh create a plan discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total ID Okay ID The new remote control is to be original trendy and userfriendly ID That Steph is your part is the userfriendliness ID The originality um is gonna take all of us ID Um the trendiness well probably go look at for some marketing research information from you Sarah ID Um and well get on with it ID Okay so well have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design ID Okay ID Right ID Everybodys supposed to try out the whiteboard ID Kate why dont you try it first if you can either bring your things with you I guess And while youre doing that well try and figure out how to hook these things on as well cause were all gonna have to be able to walk around PM Uh yeah if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces hang on PM Uh right so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal PM Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ID Uh I do not think so I think its just to try out the whiteboard PM Um Only animal I could thin I could draw UI Are we all gonna draw a cat ME I know ID Ah PM Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat PM You can tell its not a bunny rabbit by the ears ID Uhhuh PM Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well sort of Right yeah ID Okay ID Great ID And the characteristics PM Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think um because theyre the easiest to draw ID Uhhuh PM In fact Ill give it some more Oh and the tail Yes ID Okay ID Fantastic ID Since youre handy as well why dont you do yours next Steph ID I think its to get us used to using the pen PM Um sure its not to test our artistic Its a mouse ID Uh no ID A mousey UI Thats not a mousey no PM No its not a mouse PM Its a wombat ID Oh UI Its a ratty ID Argh PM A what UI A ratty ID Rat ID Not a mouse a rat PM A webbed foot PM Webbed f Oh right UI Its clothes UI Thats its clothes UI Its a ratty with a with a with a very long tail ID And your favourite characteristics of that animal UI I love whiskers UI Uh theyre intelligent and theyre cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly ID Oh ID Okay UI And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when youre doing your homework ID Kate ME Thanks ID Oh a fish UI A shark PM Gosh why didnt I think of fish PM Thats even easier to draw than cat ME Mm this is very representational fish ID Oh okay ID Fine ME Um I like them because theyre sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups so ID Favourite characteristics ID Kay ID So they have team elements ME Do you have a favourite one ID Im afraid Im with Steph ID And I think your pens running out of whatever ID But Im afraid I take the cowards way out and the cats looking the other way ID Hes hiding ID Um cats are sometimes very independent ID My parents had cats ID Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best ID Okay ID Now um we have to get down to the nittygritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um were to sell it for twenty five Euros with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros ID That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale ID Um would be an awful lot of these would be like what a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million ID Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item ID Now if they cost twelve and a half youre selling it for twenty five youre making twelve and a half Euros each ID Um and were to make a profit of fifty million thats t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ME Uh yeah ME I was just wondering if thats the um If fifty percent is normal B yeah ID Markup ME Um I would think would be more like sixty percent ME But um let me I have two thoughts ID Okay ME One hundred fifty percent ME And and your question is how many do we have to sell ID Yes cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know you gotta know how many were going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that ME At twenty five ME Mmhmm ME Yeah thats um So thats four million of them ID To give you a pretty good idea of where youre looking ID Something like that ID Okay ME Yeah ID Thats fifty million Euros ID In order to make fifty million Euros and youre only getting twelve and a half each Thats a lot of selling ME And if we make Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Two four To be fifty be four million ME Four million ID Youd have to sell four million ME Hmm ID Okay ID Right ID Experience with a remote control ID Any of you use of remote control for a television or DVD or something PM That that thats the sorta product were talking about one that will work for a in a home environment for a TVs and I think one that works would be good ID Youre both nodding all three ME Yeah ID Well Ive seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time but I also have heard about them not working well or not well coordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another UI It is true that you always sit around you know youre sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something theres five different remotes and one for the DVD and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else ME Mmhmm ME Y yeah ID And they dont always talk to each other UI But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television ID Dont know ID Okay ID Are there any um ideas for the remote ID What would it be for and what group would be be for ID We have to think about that one ME We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote UI I think one in b bright colours would be good ME Yeah ME We could totally go for the Japanamation ME Well I mean theres also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products ME Electrical their industrial design is very good UI I think one that doesnt have lots of superfluous functions UI Like Ive got one at home that has well apart from the obvious channels channel up channel down volume you know subtitles mute theres a lotta buttons that Ive got no idea what they do like ME Yeah ME Well thats a really good point because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate we tend to um go to menus and then make choices you know so if its like an uh volume button you know you can go in and say mute or or volume ID Okay ME We dont need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down UI Mm ID Mm ME Mm ID Okay ME We can make it smart like an iPod you know make everything menus UI Ooh closing the meeting ID Yeah ID Um I know this sounds like it was very quick but the I think thats the industrial design is the first one thats Kate for the working design UI That was quick PM Mm PM Mmhmm ID And user thats you S Steph for the technical functions design and for marketing the user requirements specification ID I think theres going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group and I think we all you know we like our kittycat and our rat and our fish but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done ID Uh as it says were gonna get individual instructions but uh I dont think they allowed a lot of extra time so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead ID Do you all agree UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Alright ID Um then I dont see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things ID Alright so this is the end of the first meeting ME Okay PM Kay ID Thank you all,The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the particular animal. The project manager briefed the team on the production and selling costs of the remote they are to create. The project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million Euro. The team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features in terms of functionality and appearance to consider in making the remote.
ID Uh it fell off ID One two three four yeah were ready ID Okay ID Welcome to this second meeting ID Um its now quarter after twelve and were given forty minutes um for this meeting ID This is a meeting on functional design ID Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between ID Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and Ill show them to you in a moment ID Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion because theres I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have ID Okay ID Is this ap everybody agree with this UI Yes PM Oops ME Yes ID Okay ID Um and after the meeting therell be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions ID Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting ID And go to that one ID Um as you can see it was this earlier today ID Um Kate Steph Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present ID I opened the meeting the product was developed uh and reviewed and we talked about the financial end of it ID Um and it had some implications um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese ID And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ID Are they complete did they discuss everything that we covered last time ID Kay PM Uh I think so we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well ID Did I miss something ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Im afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present but yes we did and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures but I didnt think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily PM Okay ID So um as a group I think weve are theyre accepting the minutes ME Okay I accept the minutes ID And uh okay ME Is that what were supposed to say ID Yeah UI Yeah I do ID Good ID Um then well move to the three presentations ID Okay ME Okay ID Okay ID Mm we need to move this ID Who wants to go f first ID Thats as far as it goes UI Uh not really meant to touch those microphones UI Oh it doesnt have any on does it UI Thats fine ME Excellent thank you PM Oy big loop under the table ID She said we didnt need to screw it in ME Okay ME Okay that looks good ID Its doing its thing ID There we are ME Alright ME Thank you very much ME Um ME One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you ME So um my main goal here is to reenvision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools ME Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard ME And if we devote some energy into this I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction the I go everywhere power and the high definition DVD players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools ME And um in fact I think the high definition DVD players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool ME So again most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls ME Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons ME And eighty percent of users and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television DVD stereo remote control users out there eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy PM Could can I ask where these figures come from is this market research weve Mmhmm ME Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money ID Now in between as the Project Manager they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important but that they want this remote control to only be for TV um with incorporating the corporate image colour and slogan ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools even if we directly dont um advertise for the I go everywhere line ID Mm ME So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question ME So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition ID Hmm ID Okay ME Now the early adopters those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ME Very interesting I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know the the designers but ninety one percent fifteen to twenty five Well I I I think especially in terms of growth I think this would be a very smart group to target ID Mm ID Is that a large enough target market to target it ME I mean s three quarters of the next age group twenty five to thirty five are interested and uh with the technologies improving if we can get these uh Yeah ID In real numbers does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ME To Um yes ID Or eight million ME Yes ME But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an thats a thats a very good question ID Hmm ID Yeah ME I dont know if speech recognition should be um should be included but I think its an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology PM Um How d Im wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things ID Mm UI Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any you know existing examples and what reactions to them have been and that sort of thing ID Mm ME Shall I go back ME Yeah yeah ME Yeah PM I expect an Industrial Designer should know that but if were aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty um is that a lot or a little ME Exactly ME I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that but I think the competition sussing out what other people are doing and whats in the pipeline is very very important because um there is a question about do you want an LCD screen and and that wasnt responded to but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate you know so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray ME You know its I a and I think you know No no you Kate youre exactly right there PM Sh surely hes in the wrong age group PM He must be w one of a s small population ID Mm ME But I think the key is to get the early adopters people who are familiar with technology and and uh theyll be Uh mm ID But were not looking at whether theyre early adopters on that screen thats looking at age groups ME Exactly ME I yes and Im making and Im making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people ID Leap ID Hmm ME Or comfortable you know um so I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist power channel volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers ID Mm ID Okay you had the other power channel ME And this is this is also supported by the market research ID Okay ME Thank you ME Thats my contribution ID Alright ID And well turn to the next presentation ID I think she said we dont need to screw it in just stick it in ID And then press what ID F FN and F eight ID Next to the control button on the bottom and then F eight at the top UI Yeah press them ID And then w be patient UI Yeah here we go ID Tada PM And if you want it to go into slide show mode its that little button there UI Can I not just uh do each one in order PM I you can if you like it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one that one there ID There we are UI That ID Yay UI That PM Left left a bit left a bit that one yep UI That PM And then you just press the click when you wanna go on UI Right technical functions design UI Uh well I think first off basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferencesyeah UI I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions UI So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have UI And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have UI If we can build on this with the speech recognition thats not something Id thought about at all but its also something we can discuss ID Okay UI Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or DVD remote control if this is only gonna be a you know satellite cable TV remote control ID TV only UI So these are two models of existing remote controls UI Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control ID Ugh UI It has fastforward stop play all relating to movies UI It also has seems to have channel up and channel down which is which is more what youd expect from a you know like a Sky or cable remote control where youve got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one ID Hmm UI Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right which has it also has play stop and pause and everything I dont think we need them at all UI I think we just need channel selection volume up volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access its not like teletext but along the same lines access things on the screen UI Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned because thatd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do ID Mm ID And exceed the requirements theyre expecting of us UI So it really exceed the requirements cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth sleek little remote control with big userfriendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access ID Okay ID Alright UI Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility ID Okay ID Any uh thing else you wanna add UI No ID Okay UI But we could go back to the pictures of the uh whatre they called UI The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first ME Or if Yeah ID Yeah ID Lets hear what Kate has to say UI Okay then ME Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis ID Hmm ME Whiteboard session ID I think the white that one on the right is as well as less cluttered Its there but its Yeah ME Mmhmm UI Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still its Sorry I was just Ill just uh resume something else I was gonna say UI The the style of these is terrible UI I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons positioning of buttons the actual shape of the handheld device colours just every e yeah everything to do with this has to be revolutionised ME The ergonomics the way it fits in your Yeah ID Hmm UI But So thats that for now PM Cheers PM Mm I havent actually got a display on my screen ID Okay PM Still Ill do without that PM Okay um now I wanna bring us down to earth again Im afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work PM Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting PM Um basically Ive been doing a little bit of webbased research and if I had a design team I wouldve been discussing my ideas with em PM But the the net result is that Ive come up with a first cut for the working design that Id like to discuss with you PM So lets go back to what the basic function of a remote control is PM Its for sending a message um typically um via infrared PM And the the basic components weve got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses we turn that into a message um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver PM Now I would have hoped I think thats my only slide actually yeah PM I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design but unfortunately the technology defeated me so if youll bear with me Ill do it on the whiteboard PM So we want an energy source which is there PM And weve got to think about what that might be PM Uh we obviously dont want wires on this thing ID Hmmmm PM Uh typically it would be a battery but Im open to suggestions PM Um and then we have the the user interface PM Oops PM And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message which it then transfers to some sending mechanism which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver PM So those are the basic things that weve got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty PM Thank you ID Hmm ID Okay ID Right ID But those things as long as we can get those components the block that that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ID What do the buttons look like ID Uh what does it feel like ID Thats where the user interface is really coming into its own PM Mmhmm ID The technical end is whats actually gonna be in there but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong ID For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time do you just replace it ID Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces like for DVDs movies whatever ID Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something PM Well I may be wrong here but Id been thinking of this device as being a a cheap massproduced device PM Were trying to sell four million of em um thats thats you know thats almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is ID Mm PM Um and I hadnt thought of it as being a reparable thing you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out and thats why Im a bit concerned ID Okay PM I like the idea of speech recognition thats a great idea but Im not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit ME Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements UI Whoop ID Okay ME Because then No the chip composer marketing UI Isnt that your job ID Oh UI Oh right ME Oh no the chip composer sender ID Mm PM Um Im Im Im hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that if youre asking me but Yeah ME I I dont believe I know um ID What they cost ME Okay ID Okay ME Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea UI Yeah ID Mm UI It does it does seem as if were just to do something really simple and massproduced the which is pretty much the same as these existing models just maybe a little bit more inspired but basically just the same ME Mmhmm ME Inspired ME Mm UI Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is you know how they always take two AA batteries which which is really not very efficient at all UI Could it be possible to have uh you know like a rechargeable internal battery like well like an MP three player does ME Mmhmm UI With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever ME Mmhmm UI You could you know you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours and then its recharged for ages and ages and ages and you dont have to worry with replacing AA batteries which are Youd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah ME Well that has another element which is if every time youre done using the remote you put it on a charger then you then it has a place ID Mm ME Yeah but it also has a place so exactly UI And its not stuck down the back of the sofa ID Mm UI But then again I d I dont know if this is within our price range or not ME Thats a really good idea PM Well I uh think thats a very interesting idea but um Im not a very good industrial designer and I dont know much about what these things cost PM Ill do some research for the next meeting ME Well its better than my idea about solar probably ID Okay ID Uh yeah PM Well solar may not be so good when youre watching TV in the night but Yeah I guess ME Yeah yeah ID Mm UI Well it is just so annoying how No but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install but for longterm use itll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky AA batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and you know f Mm ME Depen Mm ID It would have to sor store up the energy and then use it ME Yeah ID Solar can do that PM We may be talking quite heavy then ME Yeah ID M yeah that would be too heavy and itd cost too much PM Mmhmm ME Mmhmm Mmhmm PM So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ME Definitely cause Im thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home a um a nest a place to live exactly ID Mm ID Mm UI Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in ID Yeah ME So if you can dock it um you know you could s argue that this is Exactly ID And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent UI Still I dont know if its quite within our price range ME Mm ID Hmm ME Cause you are talking about another component like another piece of hardware UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Mm ID Okay ID Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ID Pretty much so that wed be looking for the younger end ME Well I I brought up some exactly but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there or are they making purchasing decisions PM Mm ME You know these are the Yeah exactly PM Yeah I was wondering that because I ag I agree that there therere people with uh how can I put it more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new but Bu but what I was gonna say was although they they may be buying um you know personal music devices and all that are they necessarily buying TV remote controls ID Mm ID I I s usually put more money than brains ME Oh oh oh Ill make a note of that Kate ME Good good comment PM Because they probably live in a household that has a TV if theyre at the lower end of the age range I dont know ME Yeah UI Yeah ME It might be good to know um uh who you know whos actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home PM Mm PM I think weve got a big hill to climb here havent we PM I mean weve gotta persuade people whove got a remote control cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead ME Yeah ID Mm ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ID We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it PM Right good point PM Yeah yeah okay yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah UI Thats probably more what it is PM Yeah good point ID What would be a more efficient way of doing it ME Yeah and and some of our DVD players incidentally have them because we have the relationship with our own department but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID Right UI Were not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day are we ID Probably not ME Mm ID Um the other thing that were supposed to do is make decision on our functions ID Our functions weve so far decided I think that power channel volume make it attractive ID Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys ID It has to have big userfriendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful UI Yeah ME Do we need um let me Br actually um the enter key I have a chart here that I didnt include ID Is that agreeable to everyone PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Um yeah which might Th yeah th those are felt like had a lot of charts PM Do you want the gizmo ID Throw some light on that ID Um actually were you know we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes so we have to get close to finishing ME Okay I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining ID Ah ID Mmhmm ID Okay ME Um Exactly ID Enter power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key ME Again you know thinking of menus or Um well if youre pressing enter the the thing would already be on and so maybe um when you press power initially it turns it on press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after youve um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off youd have to press power twice in succession and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power and then that would make that choice ID Is that okay with you UI Sorry I was miles away ID Would that uhhuh PM H how does that work UI I was re I was reading the chart to be honest PM How so so how does that work how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ID Then youd have to have an off te off key PM Okay yep mmhmm ID Mm PM Its not getting a bit complicated PM Could granny do this or are we just not aiming at granny ME Well Or y yeah ME Or something that has a a turning dial where at the far end is on or off UI Whos got an iPod then ME Yeah I dont um I wish ID Mm ME Anyway uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made whats most important ID Okay ME Its definitely channel volume power ID Mm UI Yeah things like screen settings and audio settings I would generally do them on the actual television itself like here you have a you know a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself ME Exactly ME Exactly UI I I wouldnt know how to do it using a remote control so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant ME Yeah ME Okay well ID Okay ME Thanks for looking at that ID So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want em to be able to do ME Mmhmm ME We dont wanna outsmart Hmm ID As you said you know dont make it too hard for the granny ID I just joined that set last week ID Um first grandchild arrived ME Congratulations PM Mm PM Uh ID Um so are we agreed then of those things ID And lets go back to agenda and hook me up ME D Oh youre fine ID Mm ID This oughta be fun ID It probably wont go the first time itll probably be like a g mess ID Come on ID Uh it lost it off here ID Uh No it was up there but I couldnt see it down here ME Its fine ID Mm ID This time it should be both ID There we go PM How do you do that PM How do you make it do both ID Um you have to keep doing the financi the the FN and F eight to five minutes to finish thank you a lot for telling me PM Ah okay it toggles through yeah ME I think you have to cycle through ID Um right were ready to close PM Yeah ID Um will be completed q questionnaire um then well have some time for individual work to continue our research um and Ill put some minutes of this meeting together ID Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components for you Steph to do the user interface and for you the trendwatching ID Um and each of us will get help from our coach ID Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch UI Yes ID Okay PM Sounds good ID Then thats the end of this meeting ID And I hope thats good enough for her to tell her thats the end ID Okay PM Okay UI We didnt come to any sort of decision on the functions though ID Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them UI Alright well thats fine then ID Um thats what I went over and nobody was objecting to them ME Okay ME Um and youd mentioned I I was just gonna say could you reiterate the new project requirements because it they were it has to be for a TV just to keep myself Yeah I think Ive Okay ID Okay ID Um the teletext is outdated the internet is important its only to be for a TV and it must include the corporate image colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range with Steph PM So were still in meeting arent we UI Mm UI Sorry what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ID It doesnt tell me ME Mm UI From their Ill just use it from their website ID Mmhmm ID Okay UI Okay PM Okay ME Right ME Thank you,"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition. The marketing expert also discussed a user target group for the remote and addressed the issue of whether the target group would result in sufficient sales of the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market, which the team later evaluated, and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate. The team also discussed options for energy sources, such as solar power and rechargeable internal batteries. Th team then discussed their user target group, marketing ideas such as selling the remote to television manufacturers, and what functions the remote would feature."
ID Hi Kate PM Just just carry on ID Okay carry on ID Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting ID Um our agenda should be um that were opening the meeting I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point ID Um and we should each have a presentation to make ID Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total ID Its twenty five after two at the moment so forty minutes is five after three um which Ill be keeping an eye on the clock for us ID Okay ID Um there are the decisions we have to turn to but well come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting ID Right um as we remember I opened the meeting the four of us were present the meeting the first meetings minutes were reviewed and approved ID Um Sarah you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be handheld power channel volume number keys possibly a speech recognition ID And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big userfriendly keys that were easy to use ID I think all of us agreed with those things ID Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple massproduced device because of the twelve and a half Pence cost ID Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point ID Um and the new requirements that it for be for TV only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included ID Um the corporate image ID So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense that were decision makers ID Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the TV but it still should meet those parameters ID Um and that the function we agreed was volume power numbers enter channels a way to move between channels easy to use and handheld ID Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition what what do the current ones sell for ID Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics ID Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed ID And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report ID Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was UI Yeah UI Yes PM Mmhmm ID Okay ID Right ID So were ready to close that and go back to our That one ID Right ID Were up to the point of the Go back ID Um the three presentations ID So were going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah ID Is that okay ID Is that alright with everybody else UI Yep PM Mmhmm ID Especially since Kate asked to be last ID Sarah Im sorry if I misspelled your name I didnt know whether it was SARA or SARH ME I respond to either ME No worries ID You respond to whatever you get huh ID Okay ID Um did you do your Hit Ah there it is UI Yeah Right ID Tada ME Okay first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up which was uh current cost of the competition devices similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and theyre uh twenty to sixty Euros depending on uh branding ME Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end ME But I think that with the current um price that were searching for were well within even on the lower end of the uh of the market ID Mm kay ME But Im going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things ME So I investigated the remote control market in greater detail and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch ME And I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research so you know Im just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here ID Kay PM Sorry PM Im glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on ME Whats hot fruit and veg ME Spongy ME And this is all over the catwalks Paris Milan and Im talking about clothing furniture shoes ME This is really interesting change from past years because it is much more organic um some would say approachable ID Mm ME And I think if were to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset ME So ME I also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing ME Fancy ME Functional is out ME And f the fancy and thats exactly the term Im Im thinking polished elegant you know kind of innovative but a cut above ME This is twice as important as the next finding which is technologically innovative ME This is interesting cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important but maybe whats innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh you know designed in interesting substances ME Ease of use ME Again pretty low I mean its the top three but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important ME So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves PM I think thats a good idea PM Dont you ME Y yeah you know Exactly UI Yes ID It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote you know your t your cell phone ME Exactly ME I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned you know so you know something similar to a summer dress ME you know it would have like fruit and veg is that we actually make these spongy ID Mm ME They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh handheld so banana pineapple and pear ME Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control wed just need to get reductionist on it ME They could be interchangeable theyre spongy that goes back to ergonomic and the youngsters love em fun for the whole family everyone can have their own ME So what were talking about is changing ME this concept ME Everyone has a TV remote but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit ME Thats whats hot on the catwalks ME So this is my This is what Im thinking ID Hmm ID Uhhuh mm ID In most families dont isnt the remote is a remote ME Y yeah but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising Im thinking the teenager the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers ID Mm UI So when your dads sitting there overriding your decision going no were gonna watch this you can bring out your own remote and be like zap no were gonna watch this ME Yeah ME W and plus I think Uh yeah ID Mm ID Well actually some households do have three and four TVs and they would have a remote for each one so ME Yeah ME Yeah ME So this is an idea and I I you know this is exactly what the research has uh has shown ME So I really open this up to uh any other feedback ME This spongy fruit and veg PM Yeah I I think were gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this ME Thanks ME Alright UI Yep PM Spongy is gonna be difficult Im afraid ID Hmm ID Hmm UI And as for as for um well budgeting as well if were gonna have lots of different interchangeable components ME I I just have my ear to the market guys UI Is this to the market PM Yeah I mean basically we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber PM I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy yeah ME Is spongiest yeah ME That would add Mmhmm PM I was thinking titanium myself UI I was thinking titanium I was thinking its just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods and theyre also minimalist and shiny ME They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority which is fancy ME I think many of us would associate those with fancy ME Something else we could do is uh call it something thats fruit and veg oriented ME We could call it uh The name ID Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ME Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable ID Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product ME So That you know that might be And then we could keep it titanium UI Yeah but its kind of pointless isnt it UI Yeah UI Lets delegate ID Wo would that be agreeable PM Yeah PM W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do UI Yeah maybe UI Or I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next ID Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ID Okay well move the Mm UI Um You can even have them in different flavours as well UI So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote it could be like pear flavour yeah ME Yeah ME Or s or smelly ME Scratchy Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone UI Scratch and sniff ME Its hot on the streets guys PM Right well I I I think some of this um youre gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you but Im afraid this is the real world PM So um Ive been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate and Ive had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division who have told me whats actually available you know what the current state of the art in components is and some of the exciting new things theyve got but Im not sure that its quite what you want um PM Now this isnt a very good overhead but this is just to show you this is the innards of a remote control um PM I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work PM No PM Um oh yeah can you see my little mouse pointer PM Right PM This is this is the a a a remote thats been opened up and thats the the back of the interface ID Mm PM And this is a pushbutton one so you see these little little buttons here theyre little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here PM Um and we thats the basic construction that weve got to got to accommodate PM We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver PM So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made Sarah but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it PM So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities weve got for the energy source PM Um we can have your bog standard double double A batteries in a replaceable um little compartment PM We can have a hand sorry a windup yeah which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control but i it maybe is doesnt quite go with the um the fruit and veg UI A windup PM Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device which is quite a ni a nice and neat one ID Alright ID Remember we only have forty minutes Hmm ME Mm PM You have to it means that if its sitting there for a long time it probably wont work but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then itll work ME Hmm PM Or we we had talked about solar power but I thing that we agreed that thats not so good in the dark ID Mm PM Now Im afraid this is the options weve got on on the case PM It can be made of plastic rubber wood o if you like or titanium ME Hmm PM Um and the nearest weve got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber but um Im gonna come back to the advantages of titanium and basically it can have a flat surface a curved surface or a double curved surface but I think if we wanna use standard components were gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that ME Hmm ME Hmm PM Okay what does the interface look like PM Um well push button thats thats the one were all familiar with PM Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something ID Hmm PM Um you can have multiple scroll buttons um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated but um its it the technology is there PM And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote but this will increase the cost PM Um the electronics that actually makes the device work weve basically got three simple regular advanced and the price goes up as we choose each of this PM If we want the nice cheap one the simple then we can only have push buttons PM All the other fancy interface designs go out the window Im afraid PM Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons PM If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more but it thats what you need if you want the LCD display PM And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices PM Now I dont know what that is but I think they think its quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere PM Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons I have to say but maybe you think thats old technology ME Mm PM And well I I think weve got two options PM We can either go for a really cheap model keep all of the costs down um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons PM Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer I think it um wont necessarily l uh look like a pineapple but um that may or may not be a good thing PM Sorry PM Um but it could have an LCD screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could have the the companys new development of the um sample sensor and speaker PM So thank you ME That sounds good ME Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference ME Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty PM Yeah Im afraid I dont have that information available PM Um manufacturing didnt actually give attach any prices to any of this Im afraid ID Hmm ME Hmm ME Because you know what Im being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot ME But I think the important thing might be to choose one ME You know if if what youre telling me is is um some of these things arent just f arent feasible maybe we could something about naming we could call it you know Blackberry PM Yeah mmhmm ME Thats uh Alright well lets see then UI Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it PM Banana UI But um I I dont know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company ME Yeah UI Its just what Id understood wed be doing ME Yeah UI Thats before I heard about all this hot tips about the future fruitwise ME But yeah Im trying to streamline mine a little bit PM We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one which would allow um say a banana but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that we have to have a push button as the interface we cant do anything fancier ME Yeah ME Hmm UI Shall we wait til Ive til Ive showed you what well my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available ME Yeah ME Mm PM Yep ME Thank you Kate ID Thank you Kate ME Mm UI You did seem to include just in more detail what Ive got though UI So so mines a bit pointless UI Right UI FN and F eight did you say ID Yes ID There we go UI I dont have it on mine though ME Oh I think um Florence resolved it by F eight again PM I If you do F uh FN F eight again its itll I think it yeah you you will do an Hmm ID Do it again ID Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there you get it yours without that one and then you get it with both UI Should I do it again ME Maybe ID Yeah ID This time it should come up both UI Right then UI I dont actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says just that my method was to look at the well my my inspirations which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing including MP three players uh like you know hifi remotes not just television and these things ID Okay ID Mmhmm ID Mm UI Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones um what functions we actually need and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber handheld piece UI Uh Ive been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel which Well I couldnt find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser so I couldnt copy and paste it but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right UI It has uh scroll wheels without without a display but they they scroll like a computer mouse ID Hmm UI So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen UI Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does UI Like you know you press enter and it comes up with whats showing on that channel at the moment and you can do you can scroll along and itll show you whats on in the next half hour and you scroll up and you can see whats on the other channels while youre watching the same channel on the screen UI Uh but Im also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice big easy buttons to press but still quite simple and quite cost effective ME Mm UI So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple uh not fancy but not totally minimalist I mean just pretty simple plastic probably I was thinking yellow and black just because thats the companys colours with very very few buttons but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen like you know just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes which is far too expensive PM Hmm UI And when youve got a screen sitting there in front of you you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you it doesnt obscure much of the actual picture youre watching ID Mm PM Yeah UI And so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote scroll along scroll up and down PM Yeah Id Id certainly support that idea UI And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber UI I mean titanium would be great but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey UI If were k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic then I think titaniums too futuristic PM Its difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well we cant for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately UI Yeah UI Whereas a plastics so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else ME Hmm UI Uh then And its a little bit pointless as well I think PM And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea cause um otherwise were were putting up the price not only for putting building the LCD in but for the electronics as well ME Its a duplication UI Like when when when youve got when youve got the screen there it doesnt have to be anything fancy just a little menu showing yeah a menu you go into one menu and then it can have your different options whether you wanna change the settings or the you know your information about programme thats on at the moment PM There is that ME Mmhmm UI I dont think thats to taxing to uh s engineer UI Um UI But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one UI And I quite like it cause its just smooth and handheld and its got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle ME Mmhmm UI Up down left right PM Do you want scroll buttons in that as well UI I I was thinking not actually scroll like a like mouse scroll but you know a I cant quite d uh describe it UI you see on the one on the right down at the bottom is the mouse UI Yeah see where the mouse is like this s style thing where you c have up down left and right PM Mmhmm PM Right UI And enter in the middle so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one it you can go into a new menu for that UI Im getting a bit uh specific here UI Really wed have to use something to show you but If I dont think I can get it up on the screen PM Yeah PM I think I think thats a g nice clean design its playing to our strengths which are in push button technology ME To uh m make it UI Ah here we go UI Right ME Oh nice ME Um Hmm UI Well the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated ID Huh UI It does scroll but it is hugely complicated PM Yeah ME Mm UI What else have we got ME Wow UI Them theyre terrible UI But they all have this this feature of this uh Its not quite a scroll wheel but its a kind of selection in this circle which I think is a really good idea ID Its a selection wheel PM But we can implement it with simple push buttons which is much cheaper UI Yeah like up down left and right UI Which is good UI And then and then Yeah so I mean either a channel up and down volume up and down next appearing programmes up and down uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen its got your things like settings and contrast up and down ID Okay UI So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle ID Okay UI And thats it PM In fact Oh thats really nice UI Look at look at this one UI Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose ME Do you think with um It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic perhaps the something reminiscent of the childs remote UI Might take up your whole living room ME Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ME And have it abstract ME You know we could call like a fruit name but it would be a little more abstract UI Possibly UI Yeah PM Hmm PM Mm UI That also is possible PM We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if youd rather if you feel if you like the spongy Hmm ME Mmhmm ME Im just just throwing out ideas UI Just Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ID Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow ME Yeah ME Im thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so Mmhmm ID Okay PM Yeah UI This is actually the volume up and down but they both say V on them which when you first look at it you expect that to be the down because it looks like a downward pointing arrow but its actually the V to indicate that its the volume so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Hmm ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Hmm ME Nice ME Good point UI But we wouldnt have a specific volume up and down UI If were having the scroll wheel then its gonna double up as all the other up and down functions ID Mm kay UI But then thats complicated ID I wanna thank you all for all your presentations ID We have about ten minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts ID Um and I think you all have been selfstimulating of working together ID Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components um the materials things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things ID So lets Mm ID Right ID They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use which the choices that weve discussed were pretty much battery kinetic or solar ID Um this is where Kates expertise comes in and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point ID The You were saying that the kinetic would be useful that is you just have to move it some and youd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries ID Um or solar that youd have difficulty with it if its a dark day that itll die on you and no way to do it ID Thats the day you wanna use the TV PM Mm ID Um so whats our pleasure here what would be the cost consequences of each of the three PM Oh unfortunately I dont have costing information ID Okay PM I i in terms of workability I I think the the two frontrunners are the standard battery or the kinetic but Im sorry I dont figures on the difference in cost ID Mm kay ID Whats the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ME Ive used kinetic in terms of watches and its very very uh handy you dont even notice um that its there UI It sounds great UI Ive never come across it before but it sounds fantastic UI Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter more convenient ME Its Mmhmm ID Hmm ME It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh you know throw the banana you know just gotta keep it moving ID Hmm UI Yeah UI Cause its really a quite attractive thought isnt it UI Its like yeah a good selling point ID So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if its at all possible ME Be Yeah UI But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs ID It costs ID Mm PM And and how much you do have to keep it moving cause Im conscious that watching TV can be quite a sed sedentary activity ID Mm ME Yeah ME Mmhmm ME But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road in terms of battery you know ID Mm UI Do your exercises while youre watching the TV PM Yeah ID Hmm PM True yeah m more more environmentally friendly UI Yeah thats what I was thinking as well ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ME You know kind of the Thats exactly what I was thinking ID Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish thanks ID Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision PM Oh right okay Id that thats something I maybe should have covered PM Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it I think because Im not sure I have an alternative ID Oh ID Okay PM I i it its just the way that the the the uh th the way its ac its actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper ID What about the ca yeah ID Oh the way we uhhuh ID Oh okay ID Um what about the case ID I think theyre talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber and I think weve discussed not having titanium ID One its too expensive um and second it wont do this double um curves ID Um weve sort of eliminated wood ID We said plastic or rubber ID Whats the pleasure PM Well if if Sarahs keen on a spongy feel the the rubber that were talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls so its yeah ME Im sold ID What about you UI Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside and then a kind of spongy Yeah s thick spongy cover so it feels like the whole things spongy but actually youre not damaging anything by squeezing it ME Mm ME Kind of like an internal egg ID Cover ID Uhhuh ID Plastic inside ME Yeah UI Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah PM Yeah PM Id Id need to talk to manufacturing again about whether thats actually possible but I agree its uh sounds like a nice idea if it is UI Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them and Just copy the one on the left ID Hmm ME And with sports on television ID Okay ME You know ID Um the next part they want is the user interface concept ME I su Then Ill just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that PM I should I should r Which I think technically is just push button and uh Id certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and its something that were an ex the companys an expert on ID Im sorry to push you but we only have a couple minutes to finish with ID Okay and it says interface ID What type and what supplements UI No um a scroll Well like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle that will correspond to a menu on the screen UI Yeah Id like push buttons with So push buttons No its still its still plugged in on mine actually ID Okay um thats that ID Um this is gonna sound weird but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes ID Whew ID And they actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can look and see this as well as I can ID Marketing they want product evaluation ME No we cant actually ID Oh ID Oh my Im sorry ME Thats why I was looking over your shoulder Mm ID Oh okay ID Sorry about that ID missed that one ID This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work ID Ah tada UI Now its gone again ID Ah PM You know I think the the companys s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately ID Yes because I cant even see mine ID Next meeting starts in thirty minutes these are the individual actions UI Oh yes ID Yeah right ID Um the look and feel design is for Kate uh Steph gets the user interface design you get product evaluation ID Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype UI Great ID Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way ME Sounds good ID Anything else we need to do UI I dont think so ID Go to it UI PlayDoh ID And thats the end of this meeting ID Thats for her benefit ME Thats really all I got guys,"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented findings from trend watching reports and discussed her personal preferences in how to incorporate the results of the trend watching reports into the appearance of the remote. The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme, sponginess, fanciness, and technological innovation. The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design. The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources, materials, case shapes, and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens. The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel. The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources, chips, case materials, and buttons to use."
ID Um almost theres one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open PM I keep forgetting whether Ive done this ID Ahha ID Okay ID Well open that when the time is right ID In the meantime Closing things down okay ID Lets see what this thing does ID Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ID Ah we came up together were good ID Okay ID Are we ready to start ID Okay ID Its now quarter of four ID This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five ID Okay ID Right ID Our agenda is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria ID We then have a finance aspect which is a spreadsheet an Excel spreadsheet ID And I know what youre all thinking of oh my um because were only given a forty minute time period to get it all in including the production evaluation ID So were going to make a very fast track ID Okay ID Um and as you can see thats what we do next on this thing ID So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it ME Red ID I need to open mine ID Not the agenda ME Agenda three ID No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes ME Mm ID That should be there minutes ID Yeah ID Okay ID Uh from meeting three is it alright with you if I dont switch it to show just use it as is ID Cause this way I can more easily flip it ID Okay um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting we reviewed the previous minutes before that um each of you made your presentations ID Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations ID The market trend of fruit and veg mm spongy uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy ID Um we decided chip on print would be used ID Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing I think was the consensus powered by kinetic energy ID There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight ID Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that ID Um looking like a scroll but its really a push button technology excuse my spelling um that was actually in use that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production ID Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management ID Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us ID Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time ID Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one ID And uh we closed as it ran out of time ID Is that a fair presentation of what happened UI Yes PM Yep ID Okay back to this meeting ID Um were down to the prototype presentation PM Tada UI Alright ID Over to you PM Right UI Well ID Ooh two UI Yeah well you see each made one we didnt have enough yellow dough ID Ah UI This is the one that I made ID Uhhuh UI It is uh curved easy to hold handheld nice and small with big easy buttons UI This is like a scroll but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus UI Of course we need someone whos experienced with the television UI I mean this is the infrared thing thats gonna zap at the television UI Uh Im not quite sure how to make that but Im sure it will work UI Uh this is on off switch cause I think we do need that and I think it gives it a nice balance UI And its gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there ID Kay ID Okay UI Um as for what its actually made of well the function of these buttons is up down left and right in the different menus ID Okay UI Uh position I presume that just means right right on it easy to see UI The main feature of it is just a simple design simple lack of uh buttons all over the place UI Right UI Form curved kind of smooth handheld makes it feel nice to hold UI Uh material I think Kates gonna tackle that quite a bit but I think we have two different options because we did make a another one which wa uh is in the shape of banana its just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons like just like this but in the shape of a banana which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology just a slightly different design ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic UI So like uh well I dunno whats it like UI I guess like an existing remote control but molded and smooth UI Whereas otherwise wed thought like with this one or mix and match just we were gonna see what you thought the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons UI So we have the two options we can follow either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints UI And what we well what conclusion we reach when we discuss it UI Uh material yeah thats what I have to say about material UI Can I scroll down on there and see what else Well colour I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons because thats the company colours but if anybodys got any other suggestions Im quite willing to consider them as well PM Mmhmm UI So it just depends what you think about these ideas and if Im yeah maybe Kate you better say what you think about them PM Um well I dont have very much to add PM Um the the case oops thats the uh on off button just come off our prototype PM The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic PM Were not absolutely sure about a combination of the two but it can be either of those PM We have the technology to do that PM Um and as for the the actual components um uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture PM We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need PM Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end its the stalk of the banana or its just the thing at the end of this version PM Um so thats for material PM Colour well uh Stephs the expert on colour PM Um we we dont have any particular restrictions on that PM Yeah I think thats all weve got to say really UI I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped UI This one has n banana yeah PM A banana UI This one has no obvious connections to fruit but because its round and molded it kinda makes you think sort of organic touchyfeely kiddie its more like yeah youd expect it to be like a childs sorta toy remote control instead of a real one which I quite like that sort of image UI Cause its very big and chunky and childfriendly and Hold them you see you know PM Would you care to examine the prototypes see how they feel in the hand UI Curvature is it to your liking ID Oh I see the onoffs in the back PM Yes thats so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it UI If you dont wanna tire out your thumbs after all ID And then you can use your thumb PM And it was partly we thought the design looked better but it could be moved if if marketing feel its important to have the on off button in a different place UI Yeah ID I could see this thing unless its reinforced having a problem with the you know yeah UI Breaking oh right UI Well you see thats why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because then itd just be rigid ME I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role ID Hmm ME Its really kind of a Mmhmm mmhmm UI Yeah we really like we really like that design I mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys UI Like a c like a compass point you know just up down left and right and we think we could make that quite a good feature UI And its like the the iPod scroll wheel but better ME Yeah ME But its also like texting you dont Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah I mean it thats what it makes me think of mobile phones I was try I was thinking moving your thumb like this what does that remind me of PM Hmm PM And its a very simple design theres not a lot to wrong the components are cheap to make UI Its texting ME Its also in terms of um being lost its its quite it looks quite different UI Hmm ME You know I I d I have several four remotes and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know this is really identifiable UI Yeah UI I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of you know text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen but we do definitely think that its a viable option ME Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Okay ID The next item is evaluation ME No okay ID Uh if thats if youre finished ME Um shall I take your uh power UI Uh yeah were finished PM Mmhmm ID Oh sorry ME Oh ID Try again ME Okay ME This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department ME So this means were going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise ME So Im going to go and use the whiteboard and Ive made a list of criteria to look at and so Im gonna Im gonna leave this up as the last thing but for the evaluation its going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria so one true seven false and Im gonna now use the um the board ME Okay ME So um fancy technologically innovative easy to use trendy buttons excess buttons good buttons ugly sellable and other ME And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms because these are things that um have been brought up some of them seem rather close like they overlap UI Yeah what about price is that gonna go on there as well ME Mm yeah price UI Price of materials ID Hmm ME Well put price up at the top UI Not that we actually know anything about it but we can we can pretend ID Well we will soon unfortunately ME Um Okay so Did you say ID Come on ID No ME Uh okay so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy UI It depends what what you mean by fancy really cause when I think of fancy I think of its got lots of extra sort of fripperies and you know like baroque curliness and which Id call these quite uh minimalist simple and plain but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality so in that respect it is quite fancy ME Mmhmm PM Yes a plain simple clean design ME Mmhmm ME I yeah so in that respect I think well go with that respect UI I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy Id say maybe aesthetic ME Yeah PM Well we have got s trendy further down but Elegant I dont know if Id call them elegant ID Elegant ID Elegant ME Elegant ME Yeah no these arent the exact terms that the um Yeah UI like stylish or aesthetic PM Stylish yeah ME Elegant ME Were gon lets use elegant although the the the people the word on the street is is Yeah UI Fancy ME N that um yeah uh the uh is fancy UI Did you just break the pen ME So lets lets take it to the next level UI Well d well just call it fancy then ME Well okay so in terms of elegant fancy ME well call it EF um do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ME Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think thats a really superior theyre both Yeah UI Yeah I think we n we need to theyre both yellow with black buttons its just that we didnt have any more dough to represent uh that but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black ID Mm ME Yeah UI So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isnt that is more curved like a banana but that isnt actually recognisable as a banana you know with the grooves and the stalk and stuff so ME Yeah ME As a banana ME I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say well call it the banana ID Yeah ME And of the two I really like I m I like the banana but I I do like the chunk ID The chunk UI So thats maybe not something we have to decide just right now is it ME No but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them UI Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two ME Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ID I think between the two somewhere between the two is true PM Yeah Id I d I dont think thats what were aiming at with this concept ID Its more true than false about a two ME Okay ME So we say true ME Um technologically innovative ME Yeah PM I think were using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative ME So well say well say uh false ME Easy to use PM Very UI Yes ME One is that inappropriate ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Okay ME Oh pardon me ME Um trendy s and I say specifically spongy fruity ID Trendy UI Oh yes ID Mmhmm UI Well maybe only a two or a three then cause its no we still havent decided about specific sponginess or specific Yeah I dont really think thats gonna work but No PM We have the worry about how robust it will be if its its curved as a banana but spongy ID Hmm PM I think yeah ME Okay ME Okay so two PM Yeah ME Um are there excess buttons ID Excess buttons PM No ID No PM So thats false ME That is false ME Um good well designed buttons intuitive buttons ID Better more intuitive buttons yes ME True ME Ugly UI No PM No ID No ME People dont respond well to ugly ME Sellable uh quirky you know something people like oh yeah PM Yeah I think theyre different arent they UI Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think ID I like it ME Yeah I do too UI It could be quite a good brand like a good little object ME Oh yeah ME And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say its cost saving ME With the Yeah with the energy UI Oh we also need tho think about the energy UI Is it the kinetic energy UI If its it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy PM Mm PM Yeah ME It is going to be kinetic PM Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Yeah well c well say its a cost saving enviro ME Uh so yes UI Yeah but we havent completely developed that side of it yet so were not completely sure about that but yeah ME Well youre still in the PlayDoh stage UI Yeah ME Anything else ME Including price do you have any idea about price or other features PM Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop PM We havent got a lot of expensive components in there ME Okay ID Yes the instinct says true ME So true one or should I go to two or three PM Id put it at one I think but I dunno what do you Yeah true it might be the yeah yeah true ME Okay UI I would say maybe a two cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things UI I mean its not just like I mean its not like ev you know on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything depending on what menu youre in ID Yeah thats not a cheap thing to get PM True ID Hmm PM Yeah thats a good point UI uh we need somebody to develop that ME Um other ME Anything else you guys can thing of ME And Im gonna actually change a couple of these so then Im gonna instead of ugly Im gonna say its attractive and then make that true so that cause I have to do an average UI Yeah PM Right ME And then um excess buttons UI Just putting no excess buttons ME Exactly ME Wow were doing really well ME Yeah be you know so it doesnt ruin the polarity UI As for see if were technologically innovative Id say it is quite innovative because there arent really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons ME Mmhmm UI I mean I know were not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market ME Or LCD ME Yeah ME Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features ME If not Ill average those ID I think were good ME Okay ME Mm ID Okay ME So Um okay how about if I uh pass this back to you and Ill uh figure out the average here ID Were a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance ID Okay ID Yep ID Right ME Thank you for everyones help with that ID Right ID And as you can see it says the same thing it had not lost itself thank Goodness ID And were going to raise whats called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me ID Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device ID Hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells ID Okay UI Well just kinetic then ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Um whats a hand dynamo PM That was the crank windup crank on the side UI Its the windup ID Oh shoot forget that ID Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one PM Just one ID Okay ID Electronic simple chip on print and well need one of those PM Uh uh yeah I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that PM Yeah simple cause weve just got push buttons so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest ID Okay and we only need one of those PM Yep ID Okay the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve ID It looks like it single curve cause of th the chunkiness ID Its thats uh uh one PM Yeah that that one is single curve isnt it PM Um do we have I I think you it means you reverse the curve UI What does double curved mean I dont understand ID And thats uh thats the the one that goes like this UI Oh no we dont need that PM Yeah UI No PM Yeah I do I dont think we need that for either of them you can do a banana in single curve yeah ID Right UI Singlecurved Id say ID No single curve ID Okay case material supplements ID Plastic wood rubber titanium special colour UI I I just wanna say plastic ID We had the special colour ID And did we say plastic PM Yeah can we do some what ifs cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself but it depends on the cost I guess ME One two three four five six ID Yeah ID Okay ID Well come back if we can to the rubber being added at the moment thats where we are ID Interface button push button interface UI Its just button UI Yeah ID Thats what were using isnt it PM Yes PM Yep UI Yeah PM Do we need to say how many buttons or or d is it just one ID Whoops dont want that not yet ID Um No it just says push button interface ID Button supplements theyll be in a special colour of black PM Kay ID And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of rubber PM Uh theyll be rubber yep ID So we need one of them ID And are they any special form UI Well yeah like the compass point one PM Actually does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material PM Cause I think they can be plastic ID Cause the rate were going we can put the rubber on top PM Yeah PM They could be plastic we dont have to have rubber buttons because we havent got a double curved case ID Oh UI Yeah they could be plastic ID Okay ID Um lets put that rubber in then of the case material supplement PM Its just one isnt it ID Uh we only need one of them ID Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed PM What were in ME Yeah ID Were in ID Thats us PM More profit UI Great ID Okay Im going to save this into our desktop project documents ID Okay ID As our project document bit PM Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ID Yeah ID There we are ID Thats the only Excel document that will be in there so its there for all of us ID Okay so are they under twelve fifty ID Yes go to the project evaluation next slide UI Yes ID Right ID Um the project process satisfaction with for example the room for creativity ID Yeah leadership teamwork means of having whiteboard the digital pens and all that kind of good things ME Sure UI Yeah ME Yes UI And PlayDoh ID Uhhuh ME Yeah PM Yeah yeah the PlayDoh was best I thought UI Yeah well cause I mean its so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying well we quite want this but imagine it rounder UI So much better just to go and you know this is it this is what we want PM Yep ID Okay ID So we went over all those things and were satisfied with all the above ME Yep ID Um did we find any new ideas ME I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes UI Yeah UI Spongy ME I I only speak for myself though UI And Id never heard of the kinetic energy before so PM Yeah UI Good work as a design team because we Oh yes PM Yeah I think were a good team actually PM Im not sure all the wires are really great though ID So we actually worked well as a group PM I thought so ID Right ID Are the costs within the budget ID Yes ME Yes PM Yes ID Is the project evaluated UI Yes ID Yes PM Yes ME I can give you a number um its uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight so it means w you know I can I can spell it out PM Oh hang on we havent heard ID Uhhuh ME There were six true or ones four um pardon me two s almost true or close to true so that was four points and then uh one false seven points so seventeen divided by nine were between one and two ME I would say thats ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place UI Yeah UI And the the only false one is because weve chosen to keep a simple old technology which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works so ME To maintain old technology exactly PM Mmhmm ME Yeah yeah PM Absolutely and its kept us within budget ME Yes UI Yeah ID Mmhmm UI So we do count as I think excellent or one ID Alright ID And weve therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary I have a final report to present um and then were done ME Okay ID We done good and were finished in time UI Bring on the ice sculptures ME Nice PM And then we get the product launch party ME So we might have to wait UI Yeah PM Product launch party ME Yeah UI Thats what I said ice sculptures PM Absolutely ME Um I one thing I want to do is oh I think the meetings done UI Is that the end of the meeting ID I believe that is the end of our meeting ME Yeah ID Thank you Melissa ME Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files because I dont think everything is saved ME The right files,"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability. Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process, in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them, the ideas they came up with, and their teamwork."
ID Alright that did nothing ID Okay ID Welcome to the meeting everyone ID Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show ID Sorry guys ME You may have to do the function F eight thing ID I did ME Oh okay ID Twice ID Thisll just take a moment PM Okay okay Okay ID Or it wont ID Okay well have to deal with it like this then ID Alright ID Um ID This is the first meeting uh for developing our our new product ID Im Heather Im your Project Manager PM Hello ID Okay ID So um ID So that was the opening ID The first thing well do is get acquainted with one another ID If everyone could go around and explain their role and um and their name PM Okay PM My names Poppy PM Im the Industrial Designer for this project PM Um Im going to be responsible for the functional design phase PM Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product ID Nice to meet you Poppy PM Okay UI My names Tara and Im the User Interface Designer UI I will also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design ID Alright ME Hi Im Genevieve ME Im the Marketing Expert ME Im an expert at marketing ME Um Ill be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product ME Um Ill be doing some trendwatching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase ID Alright Im Heather and Ive I said Im your Project Manager um Well you can pretty much read what it is that Im doing ID But um um Yeah ID And uh tool training is one thing that were going to be doing today um um as well as planning the project how were going to uh create this product and um discuss um our aims and objects of this uh Which brings us to our next subject is um um as a team were going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control ID Um we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy um a completely new style so that um can really appeal to a to a generation that doesnt want a simple plain kind of uh channelchanger ID And um it needs to be userfriendly for um maybe for an example for people that um cant see the numbers as well or um perhaps an ergonomic design PM Okay PM So this is a television remote control ID Yes its a television remote control PM Yeah ID Right ID I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now ID So alright PM Okay ID Um yeah ID Um the way that were going to go about this is um well have a time where we can um come up with new ideas alone and and work on the project and then um after weve brainstormed and and thought about we can come together in a meeting and and discuss what what um what kind of functional design we want to use ID Same with conceptual design and detailed design ID So um making sure that it its usable that as a um and that its its feasible to create and uh to come up with a concept of it want what we want it to look like ID Um tool training ID Is is everyone um Okay PM Yeah PM Got those notes ME Yeah ME Thank you ID Great ID Great ID Um One thing that uh were going to do is become more acquainted with the the tools that we have access to for our project ID Um one of them is our whiteboard ID And um as a sort of teambuilding moment um I Id like us to um try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal ID Um why that why that should be your favourite animal ID So um I Im assuming that we should do that now PM Okay ID Kay ID With our microphones still attached to our bodies PM Okay UI Gosh ID Okay ID Kay whats my favourite animal ID Do come up PM Oh to go first PM Oh are we all doing it individually ID This is a teambuilding time where um okay cool um My favourite animal which changes all the time okay right now it is an elk PM Okay lets stand up and support you Okay UI Yeah UI An elk ID alright so And it goes like Yeah its got like big antlers yeah UI A vicious We have sheep ID Looks kinda like like it has holly growing out of its head PM Do you have elk where you come from ID Yes PM You do ID Yeah we have moose and we have deer ME We have moose too PM Okay ID Do you have Kay um PM Sheep PM Yeah cows PM Thats a great elk ME Uhoh we have a good artist UI That is really good PM Yeah UI Im quite Very good ID Thanks ID This is my Okay ME Oh very shapely PM Brilliant ID Thats a sketching of my my elk and it it is my favourite animal right now cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature that um that um In a way it looks kind of awkward because its on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain and although its gorgeous its also very dangerous because it has um strong antlers and uh it can really combat its enemies even like it its a its an herbivore but uh it can really defend itself PM Mm PM Very nice ID Yeah PM Okay ID Right ID Right Im gonna take minutes while um you guys express your favourite animals PM Okay Ill go next PM I am a big animal lover PM I like all sorts of animals but for the moment Im gonna draw a cat in memory of my poor cat that died recently ME Oh ID Oh PM Its gonna be a bit of a strange drawing but never mind PM Not as artistic as Heathers drawing PM Bit more cartoon style PM But I like cats because theyre so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing PM Um but that doesnt mean theyre completely not sociable cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and um running around outside as well as being inside and enjoying their food and generally just they just seemed so cool and they just know what theyre doing PM Uh I reckon theyre sort of they got it sorted PM They know what they want PM Basically thats why I like cats ID Great PM Ill rub that out PM There you go UI Okay UI I think my favourite animal would be a dog but Im not really sure how to draw one PM Ooh UI I Ive never drawn a dog I dont think UI Im tempted to draw a snail cause I draw them sometimes and theyre really easy to draw UI Um right its gonna be a really funny dog cause Im not sure how to draw a dog ID I forget her name ME Tara or Tara PM Well there are loads of different types of dogs so Im sure itll represent one kind of dog UI Its a cartoon dog I think UI A s I dont ev Oh oh well UI Its a scary cartoon dog UI That This that does not look like a dog ID It looks kinda like a person UI Im sorry PM We can pretend ME Thats Pinocchio UI How do you draw a dog UI I suppose it has a lon Oh my god UI Right UI Yous know what its supposed to be UI Its a dog PM Okay UI Um I like dogs because um theyre so good to humans like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeingeye dogs and theyre just such friendly animals UI And like theyre more of a companion than cats UI Ive nothing against cats PM Yeah thats true UI Cats dont really like me so I cant like them UI But theyre just so friendly and warm and nice animals that dont look like that ME Alrighty ME I feel like a robot ME Okay ME Um well I guess I had the most time to think about it ME Im going to draw a butterfly because I saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving ME And it was actually the prettiest butterfly Ive ever seen out in the wild and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland ME It was like well it was a little pointier than that ME At first I thought it was a dead leaf ME And then it landed on the wall next to me ME But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this ME And then it kinda there was a green I think it was a green ring and there was like red going out like this ID Its kinda like a peacock ME Yeah it kinda was actually cause it was This part of the body was really dull and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever and Im like wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March ME So I thought that was pretty cool ME And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes ME I wish Id had my camera ME So thats gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here ME Yeah ME There you go PM Very nice ID Great ME Uh what do we Oh ID Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ME Yes I do ID Yea Right ID So now that we know how to use the whiteboard um the next um thing we need to address is our financial department to meet our our budget um or not meet our budget but more um like what kind of uh selling range well be looking at um wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros PM Okay ID And so we have to um come up with a way to to create a a uh remote control where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less ID Um wed like to um to uh make fifty million Euro ID Im assuming thats what the M means ID Um and make it for an international market ID Um one thing wed have to think about internationally is in the design of um like different kinds of uh VCRs ID Things like that depending on which country you are ID Another thing for the design team to think about ID Um we want it to cost uh absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents ME Okay so well have a hundred percent profit then ME Twelve fifty ID Im bad at math ME Okay ID Kay ID Um so now that um that is underway um it is discussion time ID So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas any um suggestions that you may have so far a um your personal experiences with remote controls and um um areas you see that uh could be improved in your experience with them ID Does anyone have any initial thoughts ME I find that in the dark its often hard to know what button youre pushing ID Mmhmm ID So whats something we could uh do to remedy that PM Okay ME Um Mmhmm PM I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing PM Its always where is the remote control UI Yeah PM So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was PM I dunno some kind of alarm PM You can press a button on your wall signal cause it always gets lost ID Yeah ID Its a great idea ID Its a great idea UI Do yous not find that um like theres a lot of um buttons on your remote control and you dont know what half of them do PM Yeah PM Yeah that you dont use half of them UI Yeah I dont know what they do ME Mmhmm ME Theres some remote controls where theres kind of a hidden panel so all those buttons that you dont really use unless youre programming or something UI Yeah PM Yeah thats thats Yeah it is ME Thats useful ME So you just have like the number buttons power button TV video button PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Alright ID Anything about um the look of the uh remote control that you might have ideas about ID Maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape it could be um something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point ME Could be shaped like a conch you know PM Mm ME Be like a shellshaped remote ID Can hold it PM A novelty PM Are we going into kind of novelty factors here ID Yeah PM Like Ive seen phones like a Okay ID Well if its a trendy original um aspect were going for ID I mean youre the designers you c you can um decide what kind of um direction you wanna go in but at this point in the in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there PM Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Yeah PM I suppose if were he heading to have it like make a huge profit out of this it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing PM Like a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than like a general kind of more acceptable But we dont wanna go towards boring cause that wouldnt sell either UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM So hmm ID Yeah ID And the key issue here is is being trendy and original PM Yeah ID Um that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous PM Yeah ID Right ID Okay we have five minutes left ID So just to cover We have one more thing ID Um like you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times PM Yeah ID Um our next meeting will be in half an hour ID So you have half an hour to uh think about what you want to present ID Or not present but bring to the meeting ID Um ID whatever that stands for ME Interface PM Industrial Designer ID Industrial Designer ME Oh industrial PM Thats me ID I have to remember these things ID Um ID Youll be beginning your your working design PM Mmhmm ID Um UID the technical functions design will will be worked on the next thirty minutes ID Um maybe how this can be achieved and um we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert ME Marketing Expert ID Um you will get specific instructions um of what to do in the next half an hour ID And Ill see you in half an hour okay PM Okay ID Kay PM Thank you,"The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group. She then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly. The meetings will focus on functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Next, each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal. After that the project manager covers the project budget, and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look. Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting."
PM Okay PM Yeah PM Thats okay PM Thats okay PM Okay ID Am I starting now ID Anytime ID Oh sorry ID Kay um ID Alright welcome back fro to the second meeting ID And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes ID Um and um Ill be taking minutes on this one and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isnt very necessary for uh myself because itll be more about uh what you guys are bringing to the meeting today ID Um so the first presentation well be looking at is Poppys presentation ID And um So sorry ID So um take it away Poppy PM Okay PM Um do I need to plugged in ID Its its plugged in ID So um No problem UI F eight w UI Function F eight PM F okay PM Function F eight PM Sorry about this guys PM Kay PM is on PM Right PM Okay PM I will take this time just to apologise PM I I only uh received my emails later on PM Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing which is not obviously not a very good part of a teamworking thing PM But there we go ID Im sure its fine PM Um so I was looking at how were going to go about the working design and what we actually need to do and what the remote control needs to do PM And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device so they can control the television from wherever they are PM They dont need to actually manually touch the television set PM So it gives them much more flexibility and allows them to be where they want to be PM Um from Uh on a functional side of things we found out that wh from our previous meeting we decided that therere certain points that will make our product unique PM Um one is the visibility in the dark which was um Genevieves idea PM So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically PM And we could use illuminated buttons which we are all familiar with when were using a mobile phone or um something fam familiar PM A automatically um lights up at first touch PM Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark PM Um also we could use um an alarm PM So if we lost the um remote control perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself which you could press and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room PM Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere PM Um so that would work PM Um oop PM Go back there PM Um another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design PM Um from previous researches Ive carried out on other projects um weve learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory PM So they can be heated and um and cooled and they change the shape of um the metal PM So for example a screw thats holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart PM So um the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life if it was heated um everything would spring apart PM So all the um individual components could be easily separated and then some could be reused some could be recycled and I think that would be very important for products now PM Especially cause theres much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs PM Cause all we all know that our resources are being limited and we have to be very environmentally conscious ID Right um one question PM Yeah ID This um selfdestructible uh metal it allows for recycling materials PM Um And then Yeah ID So that um someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contribute it then that company can break down the part the parts better PM Yeah they would um you would make the the product as you normally would apart from the the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shapememory alloy PM And thats the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end PM I mean the user would return the p product to the company cause its the products responsibility to get rid of what theyve made PM Um and then the company could then just use make use of this shapememory alloys to split up the components and then either reuse some bits and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time or not usable they might be like be able to put into scrap metal ID Yeah PM Something like the case if its scratched or something you would want to reuse it but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else ID Mmhmm ID Would we be the company that would break down these or uh metals ID Or would we contribute to another group PM You could we could probably empl em employ a a side company or something to do that for us PM But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made PM For a certain percentage at least ID Alright PM Not every not a hundred percent of everything we produce but Yeah ID Okay ID This sounds like a really great idea ID One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector PM Yeah ID Um so well have to investigate how much that will cost us cost the company um cause it sounds very labourintensive PM Yeah ID You would have to hire a number of people and it might be more expensive PM Well I the fact of the shapememory alloys is that they they dont need to be manually de um deconstructed PM Like you dont have to individually um unscrew all the screws PM Because of this their properties are smart material PM All you need is just the heat so they selfdestruct themselves ID Mmhmm ID Alright PM So I suppose it does need like high contact yeah you know high uh quality machinery and very specific machinery but Yeah ID Well still have to investigate the financial implications ID Alright ID I like the environmental approach ID Um well have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well PM Okay PM Um also there is um components PM Thisll be how it uh will actually work PM But I havent put this plan together yet ID Im sorry could you Those were um Okay PM There we go PM Sorry should I go back PM This would actually show the circuit diagram PM Although I havent come up with the final circuit yet PM So I just put all those components in ID So those are what um well c construct the remote ID Those are all the Alright PM Yeah PM I it just shows what sort of energy source PM It could be a battery like rechargeable probably PM Um an yeah well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself ID Great PM Okay PM So now is it F eight again to escape PM Or escape PM There we go PM Okay ID Alright ID Thank you very much PM Thank you ID And um the next presenter will be Tara PM There you go Tara UI Thanks UI Can you see ME Oh Function F eight UI Do you think Is it uh function eight yeah ID Yeah PM Function F eight ID Function F eight ID Sorry PM The one at the top UI Oh right UI Okay ME That looks right ID Yeah UI Okay UI Im the User um User Interface Designer UI Uh the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have UI Um in this case its the function of the remote control which is to send messages to the television television set UI By taking inspiration from other similar designs well try and come up with an original trendy remote control which is sellable international UI Therere two functional design options UI A multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices UI And a single function remote control used specifically for the television ME Im sorry what was that last one ME Multifunctional and Ch Oh I see UI Sorry UI Um a single function just for the television itself UI Yeah UI Um multifunctional controls can be difficult to use as the multitude of buttons can be confusing UI A single function remote control is simpler to use but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices ME Kay UI Um I think that a single function remote control would be preferable because its easier to use UI Itd be more compatible with a range of television sets making it more internationally sellable UI Um it will make an original design more obtainable as we have less functional necessities to include in the design UI And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic UI And less functions would have to be included UI So it would be cheaper to make UI And probably more sellable just because its more compatible with a r a wider range of devices UI Does anyone have any questions ME So as far as we know um a single function television remote control is us usable internationally UI Well its just that when were creating it were we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices ME Right UI And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent yeah other entertainment devices ME DVDs and VCR ME Okay ID Right ID Does everyone agree with this ID Does anyone object and and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go PM Um I was just wondering about the what what Genevieve said before about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing PM And that would probably um I d well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design PM I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more UI Yeah UI Yeah PM And limit the design PM Do you think ME Yeah I think I agree with the single design thing for now because were trying to do so much that if were trying to make a unique userfriendly dadada and its also multi also multifunctional um were gonna go over budget for one thing PM Yeah ME So Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Thats true UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Yeah UI And with this well have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design PM Yeah UI Well have more money to go into the design side of it ID Yeah PM Okay PM Yeah ID Alright ID Sounds great ME Mm kay ID Alright well um are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ME Yes I am ID Fabulous ID Except youre not hooked up to the Great ME Oh Im not hooked up but other than that completely ready ME Okay ME Okay ME Oh ME I just lost my microphone ID No problem we can Im sorry what was that last thing that you just said ME Just a moment ME Okay ME So Ill be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control ME Um and Ill give you a little briefing on what that means exactly ME Um if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kickoff meeting with the coffee machine ME The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly ME Um so what Ill be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control ME Um so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ME Um Ive done some marketing research a lot of interviews with remote control users um and some internet research ME And Ill show you my findings ME Oh and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose ME So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products ME Um hence our motto we put the fashion in electronics ME So I think that should be our priority here ME Um and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design ME Not just in electronic fashion ME So that its something that fits in the household ME Um we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design ID Mmhmm ME Any trends that are going on in in the public even media you know whos famous what TV shows are being watched um to influence our remote control PM Mm PM Yeah ME Okay so the findings ME Um seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly ME Which is a quite a significant number ME Um the other twenty five percent didnt specify if they love them or found them you know neutral ME Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ME Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user ID Im sorry that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ID You mean that they would spend more money on a fancylooking remote control ME Yeah theyre willing theyre willing to spend money on a remote control with personality ME As opposed to your basic you know oval black all same size button remote control ID Okay PM Mm PM Yeah ME Um so it is something that people care about ME Its not its not ignored in the household ME Um seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot ME Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot ME Theyre you know thumbmasters PM Mmhmm ME Um and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons ME That A very small amount ME Thought that was interesting ID Alright so it might be very appealing if um we have very concise buttons PM Mm PM the single function ID And another thing with um lots of surfing wed probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable because I find with um channelchangers that um a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if theyre printed on the button PM Yeah ME Yes UI Yeah PM Yeah thats a good point UI Yeah ME And actually to go with that Im gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons how much theyre used ME And uh how important the uh users find them ME So the power button obviously in an hour is only used once ME Hopefully the persons not turning on and off the TV ME Um but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten ME So people wanna be able to turn on the TV with the remote control ME Um as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set ME Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour ME Thats a huge amount ME This is the most important button ME Um so obviously when commercials come on theyre changing it so as you said we want a durable button thats not gonna run down ME Relevance of that button our users found was uh ten ten out of ten ME Uh ditto for volume selection so ten out of ten ME And its used on average four times an hour ME Not as much as channel selection but still significant ME Um audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour ME Relevance is two ME Screen settings which means brightness colour etcetera zero point five times an hour ME Um and relevance of one point five ME Were getting to specific statistics here ME Teletext um now Im not too clear on what that is ME I dont know if you can help me ME Flipping pages ME Is that So like a running banner underneath Oh UI Its um It has TV has like information it has information on holidays the news entertainment PM Its like the news PM Or like information ID Yeah PM The and whats on ID Its um No its a button that you press and then you uh like a menu pops up UI No li Yeah UI Yeah ID I havent used it before but Mm PM Its like Its like very basic internet UI And you have page numbers like for the menu and you press the page numbers with your remote and it itll come up ME Okay UI Very basic internet yeah PM Sort of um Yeah its just information that um like television timetables whats on whats on now whats on next on every channel and Yeah ME Okay UI But you have Yeah ME Like tells you the weather and Okay UI But you have no interaction back with it you know UI Like the internet you can send emails and Youve no interaction ME Right UI Yeah ME Alright ME Well I guess Im not with it because I wasnt But its its being used fourteen times an hour ME Um and has a r a high relevance of six point five ME So it looks like something that were gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control UI Yeah ME Um channel settings ME Zero point zero one times an hour ME Relevance of three ME Channel settings UI Uh probably just tuning in the channels would it be ME P Sorry ME Changing the channels UI Tuning them in at the very start UI You know if you get a new TV set you tune in all the channels do you th do you think ME Oh okay PM To get the right reception and picture I suppose UI Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay ME Um so its not used very often but people still find it relevant ME Okay ME Um biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed ME Remote controls are often lost somewhere ME So that was already discussed by Poppy ME How we could have a an alarm system so that people can find it ME Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control ME So it should be very userfriendly you know ME People know what to do very quickly ME Um remote controls are bad for RSI PM Repetitive strain injury UI Repeti Uh ME Ah PM I think ME Is that what it is ME People with arthritis and such ID Thats rather sad ME Um maybe our designers can look into that PM Oh Im guessing thats what it is UI Yeah yeah PM Im not Mm UI I think it is ME Um buttons that dont require you know very firm pushing if they respond PM Yeah ME But well have to also avoid you know buttons responding to the slightest touch as well ME Thats a problem PM Yeah PM It is ME Okay ME Did you guys uh get that one down PM Mmhmm ID Yep ME Um okay heres some ideas for you ME A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls ME So Ill show you some numbers here ME Um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ME Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control ME Um and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount ME Um that would are willing to pay extra ME So I guess were gonna have to figure out what age group were were targeting and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into ME And if we have the budget for it ME Um if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off ME Seeing as ninety percent over ninety percent would pay for it ID I agree with um if were targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into ME Mmhmm ID Um financially and and functionally ID Um and especially if we are um trying to be trendy go with fashions things like that PM Mm ID Um ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably wont be as concerned ME So that thats a whole other field of research ME I dont know if itd be if wed still have a remote or if youre talking to your television and saying change channel ME Um and depending on how many members you have in households ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ME So it m it may be too complicated for us but its something to keep in mind anyway ID Yeah ID And something that might further complicate it is that the TV makes noise itself ME Right ID Wonder if it would have Yeah UI Yeah PM And if there was conversation in the room at the same time although in theory it doesnt tend to be when youre watching television but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ID If were looking for a simplistic design if We need to decide if that is our um intention is is a simplistic design ME Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Mm ID Um because if if it is then I think voice um voiceactivated Yeah and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing because if people can activate the television with their voice then they wont be using a they wont be talking into a remote Im sure ME It looks like Mmhmm ME Itd be like the ultimate remote ME Um okay ME And th the last thing here was a an LCD screen ME So I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us ME Not practical ME Um an LCD screen though might be something that you know you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working PM Yeah ME So that you dont have so many buttons to deal with ID Um I dont know what an LCD screen is ME Oh sorry just just a screen like a computer screen ME S Or like um Yeah UI Mobile phone PM Mm UI Yeah ME Or Like an alarm clock ME Youd have an LCD versus just a a normal clock PM What what would appear on the screen ID I have no idea still ID Im sorry ME Oh just like an electronic screen ME As opposed to just buttons ME There would be like a little like on Yeah ID Oh on the remote ID Okay ME Like on the top of a cellphone the the little LCD screen ID Yeah ME Um now thats I I dunno exactly what exactly wed put on there ME I guess the channel that youre on the v the volume setting UI Yeah UI Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on and what was next UI But that would probably be Yeah PM Like linked in with the teletext or sort of like an teletext at your fingers without having to access that through the television ME Mmhmm UI That would be good yeah UI Yeah UI Might be quite expensive to do that though PM Mm Yeah PM Could be ME Well I guess thats something we can all take back to our respective research ID Right PM Mmhmm ME Um and finally whoops my personal preferences and thoughts ME Um I think our priority really should be unique design ME Um we want something that people want in their home ME Every remote control looks the same so uh in my opinion it should be um userfriendly and unique ME So the other stuff might be a little too a little too gadgety for some people PM Yeah ME Um I th myself voice recognition kind of scares me off ME So if were if were aiming to make this an international university universally accepted product Um and for all the other thing is like age market PM Mm ME I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds we could go for the fancy stuff ME But if we wanna make fifty million and and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe stick to the basics ID Mmhmm UI And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control ME Mmhmm UI Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control when theyre just starting out and yeah ME Right ME And we have to keep in mind the the reliability of our research ME I mean you know a sixteen year old boy would say yeah Id pay extra for voice recognition until they realise thats three months allowance UI Yeah ME Um so I I think I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more UI Yeah UI Early twenties thats the kind of age group ID Yeah ID And if one of the largest uh or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control Im sure that something like an LCD screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem UI Twenties ME Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Yep PM Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Alright ME Okay PM Okay ME Thats it for the market research ID Okay ID Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like Ive received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions ID Um for one thing because Having controls with DVD VCR that sort of thing would really complicate the design of the remote control ID Um weve decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television um function ID Which is good as as weve sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway ID Um for many reasons ID So um we have that decision sort of made for us ID Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people are using the internet now ID And so uh we wont concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option PM Can I just interrupt ID Yep PM Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ME Yeah ME Maybe we can do the There you go ID Okay sure ID Yeah I do ID Im looking at looking at it right now PM Okay PM Thanks ID thank you ME Oh come back screen ME Hmm PM Were they was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext or just avoiding both altogether ID Um well I mean we dont have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Okay PM Yeah PM Okay ID Alright and another thing ID This is for the design the design of the product is that um we wanna create um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company ID So um all the remote controls must have our um Well incorporate our logo and colour in in some way PM Right PM Yeah PM Yeah ID So um perhaps um our logo on the bottom or wherever you feel like it would look good PM Okay ID Um it doesnt have to be the colour of our um of our company but another thing is that um we need to we probably would have to have that colour and and logo decided upon PM Just Okay ID Um Im assuming that we already have one but for the purposes of this meeting I I wasnt offered a like a type of logo or colour so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable PM Work on that ME Its probably R RR in yellow UI Yeah PM Yeah ID The little R R yellow thing ID Okay ME Yeah I think UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ID Real Reaction ID Okay ID Um yes those are the changes ID Um so now we need to discuss um and come to a decision on our remote control functions of of how this is going to be ID Im just going to look at my notes for a second ID Um we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control ID So um we already know that itll just be for the television PM Okay ID Itll It wont have teletext ID But um you know we could discuss um those other options that you brought up Genevieve ME Okay so I Are we going to write off the LCD option PM Yeah ID Is that how most people feel about that UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Okay ID Okay ME So no LCD no teletext and no voice recognition UI I think it would be annoying though if I dont use teletext that much but if it was on your TV youd want to be able to use it if Youd Yeah ID Yeah but another thing is that if were reaching an international crowd um I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext so itd be really superfluous ME Yeah UI So is it just Okay ME Never heard of it PM Yeah UI Alright ID Yeah UI Right ID I dont know about other countries besides the UK ID Do you know if anywhere else has it UI I dont know PM I dont know UI I dont know PM More research required I think ID Alright PM But if Was it a management decision that were having Okay ID It was a management decision so its its pretty much out of our hands at this point UI Yeah PM So Okay UI Okay then ID Kay ID So I guess were looking at something rather simple ME Um well I guess just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons PM Kay ME Um PM Minimal Yeah okay ME And the What was the word they used ME F findability is important ID Yeah ID I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Cause Im sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise PM Yeah PM The same signalling PM I mean Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone ID Its not that expensive to do PM Like you just a a buzz or something ID Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Okay ID I like that idea UI Would you be able to um put the little device anywhere UI Cause uh isnt our remote control for all TVs so youd ha Yeah with the button that you pressed PM If Do you mean the the link between the Well if the button was actually on Oh yeah ID Yeah ID The button Oh UI Yeah UI C cause then it would only be a applicable to one TV set so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere or something ID Minor detail there PM Maybe Yeah yeah PM Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive ID Yeah it would have t Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Obviously something small thats Yeah thats a good point UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Then it wouldnt it probably wouldnt be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller PM Yeah UI Yeah ID Okay PM Yeah okay UI Would it need a battery then ID Maybe um Probably I mean PM Pr probably PM Unless it could be Okay ID Thats your department youll have to sort that out ME Mm PM Um unless some way it could have some universal connection to like the socket the same socket that the TVs supplied from PM I mean the power for the TV UI Yeah PM So mm more research into that one ID Yeah youll have to Yeah youll have to investi Do some research on that alright ME Mm PM Yeah ID Great ID Um alright and Im sure that um um the glowinthedark fluorescent whatever system um is a go ahead ID Is everyone interested in that PM Y Yeah ME On the buttons UI I I like the light up suggestion UI I think that would be better UI Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time so I would go for Well just the numbers could be embossed couldnt it ID Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME it doesnt It could it could be a tactile thing as well ME Um right if w if were minimising buttons we might be able to make them actually larger ME And theres something on it ME S you know like up arrow down arrow for for volume PM Like a raised Yeah Thats true ME Um and I dont know what we could do for for channels ME S The numbers themselves UI Like raised UI Yeah ME But then the like up button and down button for the channel channel changing UI Could be raised UI Just little arrows that you could feel maybe ME Yeah ID Hmm ME I just thought that it it might be sucking more battery power if there if it is a light up ME Im not sure UI Yeah ID Yeah PM And also y uh Heather you mentioned before um like how it should be accessible to everybody ID But I mean Yeah PM Um so like big b um buttons for people you are visually impaired UI Yeah PM The glowinthedark or light up wont make any difference anyway ME Mmhmm PM So like you say tactile might be better because itd be more available to everybody UI That I think thats good yeah ID Yeah ID Could we somehow We could may possibly sorry incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glowinthedark material ME Mmhmm PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Cause I d I dont think that glowinthedark material um like the actual soft plastic um costs that much more than other colours ME Mmhmm UI No I wouldnt say so PM No its not these days PM I mean its quite easily accessible ID Yeah ME I guess the other option referring to the battery thing is you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something when youre s and then it goes so if if youre like changing the volume during a movie PM Yeah UI Thats good Yeah that a good idea PM Yeah ME I know Im thinking of mostly when youre watching a movie you turn all the lights off right PM Yeah UI Yeah ME And you dont want to turn on the lights to turn it down because theres suddenly an explosion and its gonna wake up the baby PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Um so if you touch the button it kind of reactivates it ME It lights up for On self timer UI That yeah thats a good idea PM Yeah PM Yeah PM So selftimed lighting ME Yeah ID Alright we have five minutes left um for the meeting but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close PM Um I Yeah ID Um what was I missed the last moment reading that ID What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ME Oh just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten fifteen seconds when you touch a button after having not touched it for a while ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Um if instead of a constant light up on the on the remote control if it lights up for ten seconds when its touched again ID Mm ID So it could be any button that would be pressed ME Yeah and you you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit and it gives a faint glow PM So selftimed Yeah ME So if you have all the lights off in your living room youll youll temporarily see it ID Yeah ME Because usually youre not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds UI Yeah ID Okay so Thats probably feasible ME So Mmhmm PM Yeah ID So do you think that we should do the lighting up thing and the glowinthedark thing and the shape of the numbers ID Do we have to kind of decide what were gonna do with this PM I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea UI Yeah ID Yeah okay PM And I think thats un unique as well UI For visually impaired yeah PM I mean I havent seen that ID Yeah ME Mmhmm PM And as youre saying like numbers can wear off if theyre just sort of like painted on you know printed ID Yeah yeah ID And it could if its that softer rubber material itll be maybe um uh better for people with um els no whats it called RSI what was it that we were talking about PM durable PM Oh yeah UI Yeah ME Oh right the Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Repetitive strain injury ID Yeah instead of like hard buttons ID Okay PM Mmhmm ID Um did we want to go for the glowinthedark look ID Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly UI If I was thinking though if it was glowinthedark you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glowinthedark and then it would be constantly advertised ID Like should we do both ID Or we can have one or the other ID Because it might for for our design purposes I mean the lighting up thing might be better because glowinthedark material has a funny kinda colour ME I was gonna say Exactly ID And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with PM Yeah ME It the it might be perceived as tacky glowinthedark ME Its kind of like Eighties neonstyle ID Yeah PM Yeah and we could Yeah there are now like loads or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well which could like link in with the company colours ME Um whereas were trying to be trendy and fashionable ME So Mmhmm PM Like it could be blue or green or yellow or like weve just limited t with the just ordinary phosphorescent so Yeah ID Right ID Right ID Alright ID So weve decided on lighting up things ME Mm PM Every time the that it lit up you c that could light up as well ID Yeah UI Yeah PM Or or the whate Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah ID But with the same thing I mean ME Thats true ID If you touch the button and then it could be it could be lit up as well UI Yeah UI Okay ID Is Are you okay with that UI Yeah ID Okay ID Cool ID Um Alright ID So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions PM Is Okay ID And now its up to designing ID And um making sure that this can be feasible ME What um Oh sorry ID And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ME Yeah well I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control ME Um it you cause you mentioned face plates ME So I I dunno if theres something that diff you know like five different face plates ME I dunno if this will start making it more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the of the remote UI Oh yeah PM Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something ME Um Yeah Exactly like an iPod UI Interchangeable thing ID Like an iPod or something UI That would be good PM Yeah or Okay ID Okay UI Yeah ME Exactly ME Or or like mobile ph ID Like a cellphone ID Yeah ME And I dunno if wed want to go with like TV show themes or something ME Like a Bart Simpson faceplate UI Yeah and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well ME But Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Yeah UI Y Could buy extra Yeah ID Accessories ME Exactly ME You could start out with three and if if we hit it big then we can add some on PM Person Yeah PM Well thats great UI Thats a good idea ID Yeah UI Yeah ID I think that we should incorporate that PM Interchangeable PM Um als Yeah ID Cause that wouldnt be very expensive at all ID Youd just get one mould throw some plastic in it you know UI No ME Mmhmm PM Interchan And also possible I mean uh we could gain out of that by advertising certain TV shows or Yeah UI Oh yeah ID Yeah ID Well that might be com problematic with um copyright issues ME Right ID So if it takes off then well well well try that out PM But if we there is Yeah UI If w No PM We could Um the environmental factor we didnt bring that up again ME Right ID Right ID Well have to do more research ID Like as of yet that has nothing to do with um the way itll look PM Yeah ID Um does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now PM Um Ive Okay ID Because we need to investigate the financial implications ID Okay PM Lets I think we could probably leave that til later on then ID Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ID Or should we Okay ID Good ID Alright then ID Anyone else have anything more to say before we close PM No ID Alright well ID Lets have lunch and well discuss this later UI Okay PM Okay ID Alright PM Thank you,"The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex. The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group. They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting."
ID Is everyone ready to start PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Yes ID Okay ID Great ID Well welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design ID Ill just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running ID Okay ID Um on the agenda for this um for this particular meeting well have your three presentations on what youve done since our last meeting after we came up with um some general ideas of our design ID And um then we have to make some key decisions on on our remote control concept and how were gonna make it what uh materials were gonna use and that sort of thing ID The meeting will be forty minutes long PM Okay ID And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter PM Okay ID Alright and I will switch up PowerPoint PM Thank you ID Okay PM Should be just loading PM Okay PM Oh although I cant see it on my screen PM That says go here PM Okay PM Ive been doing some research into the different components that we could use um whats available to us f to actually make the remote control PM Um first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what is it happens inside the casing which is more your field PM Um thes main internal feature is a circuit board which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source PM Which is not necessarily a battery as were about to see PM Um there are several components of um the circuit board that we need to consider where well be getting them from what theyll be made of PM Um including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip PM Which is where all the main information is uh contained PM Um diodes transistors resonators resistors and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well PM Um and all their positioning in the circuit ID Um Are they all included like mandatorily or r are these different options PM Uh these theyre all different options theyre all separate apart from the chip which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple a regular advanced ID Yeah PM We can go into that later PM Um all the other things are individual components that wed have to get in separately and work out the most like effective um circuit including all the wires and everything like that PM And the LED of course thats a light emitting diode PM So we could so weve got flex flexibility with colours and things with that as well ID Mm PM Okay there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source PM We could use a basic battery but that brings with it like they need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as well PM And theyre not so great to dispose of environmentally PM Theres a handpowered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago PM A bit out of date PM Kinetic energy is something thats been recently developed ID Um What is a handpowered dynamo PM Um where you manually charge up the power PM Like you wind up something ID Just every every once in a while PM Sorry ID Just every once in a while or constantly PM Yeah PM Every once in a while I think PM But its Yeah ID Alright ID Itd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think PM It would be like going a step back in time UI Yeah PM I dont think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology ID No PM Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea thats being used by some watches and other devices where you just shake the device and it gives it power PM I mean the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work PM Um or theres solar power which weve been considering inside a building which is where its gonna be used might not be quite so useful ID Right PM But good to look into renewable energy always the way PM Um lots of considerations for the case like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat PM Thats got a lot to do with the ergonomics PM Like how its comfortable and s sits in the hand PM We dont want something thats huge and you cant pick up PM Or too small PM Or too slidy PM I know Ive had a remote control before which you couldnt tell which was the front and the back cause it had so many buttons on and the shape was so symmetrical that Id be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button ME Mm PM Because you cant really see which way round it is ID Right PM Um we also can choose what materials um the we could use metal we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the antiRSI PM Its like the same sort of rubber thats used in stress balls and things like that so its very like soft not so stressful on your hands ID Mmhmm PM Wood PM Um again stepping back in time again there PM I dont think thats quite up to date with what were looking for here ID Yeah PM Um titanium is not gonna be possible even though it just it beyond our budget really PM But wouldve been maybe for future projects PM Um right our choice for buttons as well PM Weve developed some weve got some good advances in technology with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons PM I think that was brought up for um theyre basically quite a flexible design modern you dont have to use individual buttons PM You can just slide up and down PM Im sure were all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads UI Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Um one thing with the scroll buttons though ID It it we would have to have an LCD um display and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult PM Yeah PM Thats true PM And that would lead to an advanced yeah PM If we have yeah PM Were going on to that later with the advanc with the LCD that means wed need a really advanced chip ID Yeah PM And its unlikely that thats gonna be in our budget ME Mmhmm PM Um also weve got the integrated pushbutton which is what were most familiar with PM Its the most straightforward PM But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well PM Got decisions to make there PM And this is what I was just saying before PM Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs PM Um simple would go with the pushbutton PM Um regular you could link with the scroll button PM And the advanced wed have to go with a LCD s display ID Right PM My personal preferences PM I think we could go for the kinetic energy source PM I dont I think thats quite um an advanced kind of technology PM Its not been seen before so it could be quite a a novelty factor attractive as well PM And also energy saving cause youre producing the energy you dont need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels PM You just give it a shake ID Yeah PM Sounds brilliant to me PM Rubber casing I thing would probably the best if were going for the antiRSI and like more choice with um aesthetics ID Uh PM Like it could be pretty much any colour we want PM Um and gives you yeah more flexibility there PM And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple then we could possibly have the scroll and the push but no LCD cause we probably cant afford that one ID Yeah ID Um one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior PM Mmhmm ID This is the one thing thats protecting its innards PM I think that would uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing PM And the rubber would just be the whats in contact with the human ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Another thing is it might be more difficult if its a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Um is it I dont see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there ID Like if it was sort of like a clipon plastic plate ID It would work that way PM Maybe if the um if it was just kind of a more of a rubber coating which was on to a case UI W Like plastic with rubber kind of on top Well theres there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing b like a Nokia it is PM So it was kind of the whole thing would be removable PM Yeah PM Like I cant think of what ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something thats just its protective as well ME Mmhmm UI Its yeah ID Yeah ME Like the skin ME Yeah PM It it stops it I mean it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something as well cause it wouldnt damage itself so easily ID Yeah ID Alright PM I think i maybe a mixture of both there maybe ID So maybe the Yeah ME Okay PM Yeah ME So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber PM And then yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Okay ME And the buttons obviously are rubber ID Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Okay ID Yeah ID That sounds good ID I um is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber PM As far as I know PM It should be ID Okay well just say yeah PM Yeah ID Yes just why not PM Yeah yeah ID Alright ID I like the kinetic energy source idea PM Yeah PM I thought that was Yeah ID Um I dont know when people will um be moving a remote around a lot UI Yeah tha Backup ID But I think that its worth it kinetety kinetic um energy source ME Mmhmm ID It could make an we could have any kind of style ID It wouldnt be as heavy or bulky and Yeah PM Yeah ID Just for environmental reasons PM Yeah ME I guess its a bit scary cause it hasnt been done before PM Yeah ME So it seems wed have to do more research on it ME Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack PM Yeah PM Like as a backup for something ME Yeah so theres there is a one battery because most remotes use two batteries I believe UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ME So if it was running off of one battery as a Right UI That would be good yeah PM Yeah PM Some alternative just in case something went wrong UI Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors but a lot of calculators yeah have solar power PM Thats true PM I just thought of that PM Yeah UI So maybe that could be incorporated as Yeah PM Yeah PM May maybe that could be the backup PM Instead of a battery ID Yeah ME Although it needs some light doesnt it PM Like solar backup PM Yeah UI Do do those calculators yeah PM I suppose s but some But thing is its not you dont need the solar all the time ID Yeah you can watch a TV in the dark then ME So if were doing yeah ME If were Yeah UI I dont know how it works PM It can be stored PM It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it UI Yeah PM It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day UI Yeah PM Like a few hours a day ID Yeah ID I think that might be a little impractical though ME Yeah ME I think sometimes its just shoved under under a cushion and yeah ID Yeah PM Thats true PM It could easily Yeah UI Yeah ID Like people dont wanna have to worry about that ME Yeah ID Yeah PM I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think oh no I forgot to charge my remote today PM Like if the kinetic thing I think whats best about that is that its instant energy ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah PM You dont have to you know you can shake it a few times or whatever ID Yeah PM And it works ID Or just like pick it up when youre gonna use it PM Yeah UI Yeah I suppose PM Instead of you dont have to like make sure its in the right place to charge and ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Alright ID Cool PM K okay ID S that the end of your presentation PM Yeah UI Yeah ID Alright ID Thank you PM There we go UI Thanks UI Oh UI Its not on my screen UI Why PM it wasnt on mine either PM I dont know why PM I think I just I just used the mouse on there UI You dont know why UI Oh okay UI Is it that one ID Yeah ID Thats um Oh PM Yeah UI Um Im just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now UI Uh first of all Ill explain what a user interface is UI Its the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived for example heard or felt maybe or by the human user UI And its also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data UI Um there are two types of user interfaces UI Theres the graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device for example a mouse for input control UI So thats sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about ID Okay UI Yeah ID Yeah UI Im not really sure about the pictures that maybe thats on an LCD screen PM Mm UI Or maybe its the the buttons or pictures or something ID Hmm PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Do you think its Yeah PM So I suppose sometime after you ID Yeah cause Im sorry ID Um because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard ID Youre pressing the numbers for um for what you want UI Yeah PM Mm UI So you must for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics UI Like an LCD screen PM I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol UI Yeah PM And if you wanted to go onto teletext or I know were not having that but I mean a similar thing you they have theres a like little picture with a screen with lines across it which I suppose its that sort of thing like the the symbol on the button UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah PM But if were having a simplified display anyway w that we probably wont have to focus so much on that ID Yeah well be doing Yeah PM Itll be more the on the numbers and the volume UI Yeah ID Itd be more a command interface and then Yeah UI Yeah PM I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume display and stuff like that ME So its just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ME The infrared is like thats considered a Okay PM I For inp Mm ID Hmm UI No I think its to do with the actual symbols that are on the thats on the buttons of the remote control and per Well it could be a wee scroller thing and something could come up on the screen ME So when it says pointing device that doesnt include Okay ID Yeah ID I think theyre talking about LCD type things UI Yeah ME Okay ID Yeah UI But um I think were gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more simplistic ID Yeah ME Mmhmm UI But the we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe ID What do you mean UI Like I cant think of an example but Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound ID Oh yeah like how the buttons Yeah as a button though UI Instead of saying volume like a little speaker or something UI Yeah something y Yeah m perha yeah ME Mm ID So its a keyboard in the shape of it right ID Okay UI Yeah UI Maybe ID Yeah ID I like that idea UI Um the co uh weve decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control UI As it would be less complicated and the controls would be more userfriendly UI Um the remote control would be cheaper to design so that wed have more money in the budget to um target the design area of the interface UI You know make it more trendy and original UI Well have more money if we keep it simple ID Yeah ID Im sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget UI Yeah PM Yeah ID A bit more too yeah UI Seeing as its quite a new technology UI Um We we also have to keep in mind when were designing our um more userfriendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons that um that their functions colours and forms arent always helpful PM Yeah PM Thats true UI Yeah PM Thats in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things UI Yeah PM It can be a bit yeah overwhelming UI And that all interfaces are different UI So um that doesnt improve the use of the produ product so we need to come up with something thats easy to understand UI And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use ID Mmhmm PM Yep UI Does anyone have any questions ID Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour just to keep it give it a simplistic look UI Mm ME I think if we go with the um design plate thing well have to ME Just because of colour clashing and if we wanted to so and and we might I mean depending on what comes out of the design we might have to stick to just black buttons ID Yeah ID Yeah UI But um Yeah ID But what about the lighting up effect ME You mean different colours for the lighting or Mmhmm ID Um well um I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons theyd all light up ID And so if they were black it wouldnt be possible for them to light up ME Oh I see what youre saying ME Well y Oh so youre picturing the light is coming from the back ID If they were white they would glow probably ID If they were made out of rubber ME I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards PM Oh ME But but I guess you mean from the back ID Oh ID Where would the light come from ME Okay PM Id assume like an internal light that comes through ME Okay ID Yeah PM So there would have to have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something ME Right ID Yeah and well rubber is a more translucent product too so we have that taken care of PM Yeah yeah ME Mmhmm PM It should be able to mmhmm UI In the phone that I was thinking of as well when you change the um covers of it the the little buttons that actually you know that contro control stuff are behind the rubber PM Li yeah UI So you can change the buttons when youre changing the faces UI Do you know what I mean ME Oh ME Yeah ID Oh UI Cause its just the wee control yeah thing thats behind it ME They they insert over ME Okay UI So I mean we dont have to decide on one colour ID Mm UI Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe PM Mmhmm ID Well if theyre raised up buttons UI Yeah ID So that you can feel them ID We were talking about it being more um a lot more tangible ME T Okay is that my turn then ID Um it might be more difficult to do UI Yeah ID If theyre if theyre sticking up ID If its flat then like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone its like all very flat and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons but Yeah UI Yeah PM I think it would be possible PM I dont think it would make that much difference PM I mean the uh the dimensions of it PM Cause if its just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone PM You can like take off the hard cover and then theres the like say the buttons PM And then you get to the circuit PM I dont think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the the top casing PM Im sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing without causing too much difficulty ID Yeah PM Im sure thatd be fine ID Okay UI Yeah ID Alright ID If its doable we can do ID Yeah sounds good to me UI So thats everything then PM Okay ID Alright thank you ID That means youre up UI Yeah ME Alright ID Yeah ME I have a shorter report for you today ME Um it took a while to get this uh Uh PM Youre not plugged in yet ME Oh ME Thats a very good point ME Okay so um this report is about uh trendwatching ME Um basically so we can live up to our our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control ME Sorry ME There we go ME Um So just so you know my method was mainly web webbased research this time around ME I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan New York and Paris ME And I looked at the design reports from previous years here at Real Remote ME Um just so c we can work off of them see how fashions have changed ME Um so Ill list the three most important aspects that Ive come across ME Um and they theyre each more important than the one that comes after it ME Uh the first one is that there should be a fancy lookandfeel instead of the current functional lookandfeel ME Um this should be our priority as weve been saying ME The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative ME So I think weve done a lot of talking about that just with lighting and the buttons and the faceplates ME Um so it looks like well be able to keep on track with that ME And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use ME So pretty basic there ME And the recent fashion update uh according to fashionwatchers in Paris and Milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture ME Um also in contra uh in contrast to last year the feel of the material is expected to be spongy ME Again weve already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons ME Um So my personal preferences here um of course as we weve already talked about the personal faceplates in this meeting and Id like to stick to that ME The fruits and vegetable themes I dont know if thats going to work for us ME It sounds something that youd use on kitchenware ME I dont know if we wanna do it on remotes PM Mm ME It could be one of the options ME Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen ID Mmhmm ME Um the temporary lightup idea sounds like were gonna stick to that ME And then uh tying in a trendy look with userfriendliness ID Yeah ID Yeah its the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring ME Mmhmm ID Everything else we can really we can really um do according to our plans already given the market PM It is strange ID But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control ME Its its a little but it its everywhere UI Yeah PM Well We I think we possibly could take a more abstract design ME So maybe we Ive seen a lot of purses with olives on them you know ID Yeah ME But I I think I think if we stick to TV based you know maybe TV shows or Or colour schemes ID Yeah UI Yeah ID But they still need to um fit into peoples decor though ME Right PM Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables PM And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes PM I mean we dont have to make something in the shape of a strawberry but it could have the curves of a strawberry or something ME Yeah ME The The essence of strawberry UI Yeah yeah PM Or a strawberry seed or a leaf PM Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract if thats fits in more with what were doing ID Yeah ME Yeah PM Instead of fruits and vegetables just if you look at it straightforward its a bit yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah PM It doesnt s quite fit in with the trendy well obviously it does if thats the current theme ID Yeah PM But may maybe we could go more directly I dont know ID Yeah PM But initially I dunno PM I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit ID Tone it down ME I guess yeah PM Yeah and like not not yeah ID Yeah like more like photos of fruit on on our product UI Yeah UI Or bananashaped ME One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting we talked about our favourite animals UI Yeah ME So maybe there could be animalbased you know ME Because a lot of people have a house cat ME Or or a dog PM Mm ME Um that might be getting you know too specific and we should see what the success of the first faceplates are ME But its something to keep in mind ID Mmhmm ME And did you have any questions ME Pretty straightforward PM Yeah ID Yeah um Alright given that information we need to start making some more specific decisions ME Okay ID So Ill need to um hook up the PowerPoint again ME There you go ME Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay PM I didnt for the first one PM But I have now ID But its still around right PM Yeah ID Okay PM Uh hopefully UI Where do you have to save it to PM Project documents I think UI Okay ID Okay ID Im just trying to make this pop up now ID Alright ID Here we go ID Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do ID So energy we oh PM Okay PM Kay ID Oh no I cant write it in when its in this setting ID Does anyone know how to take it out of Um yeah UI Just escape I think ME The PowerPoint ID Yeah ID Okay ID Um so back to decisions ID Energy weve decided on kinetic right PM Kinetic yeah UI Yeah ID Okay so thats good PM Are we going to have a backup ID Hmm PM Or do we just I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and be bold and innovative and hope this works and well hope that it works ID But would a backup really be necessary ID I mean will people just use the battery if theres no if theres if there is backup ID Yeah ID Yeah PM I think yeah ID Theres like no reason why it wouldnt work right PM I think no ME So So if its not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it PM I I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential ID Yeah ID It could even be one of our selling points PM Go for it PM It could be fully kinetic energy UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Environmentally conscious or something PM Is everyone happy with that ID Yeah PM Yeah ME Okay UI Hope so ID Alright the next um decision is chip on print ID I dont exactly know what that means PM Um it was whether we went for the simple the regular or the advanced chip PM And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have so Yeah it was so that was without the LCD ID Right and we were going for more simplistic style right UI Yeah PM So that means were not doing the advanced ID Yeah PM So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons ID I think we decided on the pushbuttons right UI Yeah UI I don yeah PM Uh so thats the simple ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting the interior lighting system PM Yeah possibly PM So its probably gonna be the regular chip that were going to need ID Yeah PM So its a medium ID Okay PM So regular chip ID Thats called medium or regular PM Regular sorry ID Kay PM Regular chip ME Oh is regular not simple UI Yeah PM Lighting PM Yeah if we because of the lighting that weve decided to put in as well UI Its for the lighting yeah ME Right right right ID Okay and cases ID Um does this is this dependent on shape or what its made of or what PM So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case which we will decide on rubber UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Well I guess plastic and coated in rubber PM Rubber UI Yeah plastic coat PM Yeah ID Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah interchangeable plates PM Plastic rubber coat PM Interchangeable yeah PM Still going for that PM Yeah ID Okay ID User interface concept ID This is your time to shine UI We decided on the component UI I I Im sorry Ive lost my um PowerPoint thing so I cant remember what its ca its the component The command inter The command line interface yeah PM Your screen ME Think it was called command interface PM Was it Ouch ID Oh yeah ID Yeah ME Command interface ID Command interface ID Did you say command line UI Yeah ID Okay ID Line interface ID Alright and supplements ID Whats that all about UI Um I think that is well we havent really made any decisions about what were gonna do about the cluster of button functions colours and forms in the in consistent use UI Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ID Um Mmhmm UI You know how um different interfaces are very different and can be confusing because because of their difference and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have UI We havent really decided what to do about that ID Um what are our choices here UI Well its just um w where where shall we locate the buttons UI What kind of functions wi shall we have ID You mean like well have the numbers of the channels and well have the channelchanger and volume and power PM The power PM Volume ME Mmhmm UI So pretty just just the basic button functions ID Um Yeah ID Like I dont know if we should go into like adjusting light levels things like that because different televisions will have Um yeah PM May yeah PM Tone contrast and things PM Thats a bit Yeah it was minima well it wasnt the l Yeah ME That was on um one of my presentations ME About how often it was used ME Do you remember that ID Yep UI Yeah ID Yeah it was hardly ever used really ME I w Should I bring it up ID Yeah PM That would be good ID And most televisions will come with a remote PM Yeah and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television so Mm UI Yeah each television ID Yeah ID Kay well we know we want numbers ME The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour ME So tw twice every once every two hours ME Um and it was considered a one point five relevance on a scale of ten ME Thats brightness colour tone all that UI You dont change that often yeah PM I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself doesnt it PM Im sure it has its own buttons so you dont necessarily need to have it on remote ME Mmhmm ID Yeah it does ID Yeah and different televisions UI Yeah ID Like we I dont know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that PM Yeah PM So were just going for power channels volume Mm ID Volume ME The other one was audio settings ME Mono stereo pitch ME I mean I sometimes use that ME Some TVs will have the option of like living room style movie style um and that they say thats used zero point eight times an hour which is actually somewhat high UI Yeah ME Like almost once an hour ID Yeah ME Um relevance of two ID Oh ID We have five minutes to finish our meeting ID Crap ID Okay um lets do this fast ID Um Should we have audio ME Well that didnt some up on mine ID It only comes up on mine usually UI It w it would seem silly if wed having anything else just have an audio button though ME Oh UI Do you know ID Yeah I dont I its its a problem with the international uh appeal I think ID Um if we have audio because we dont know how other televisions work UI But we Yeah ID But we know that everyone has this and its the same ME Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing cause it mm it is a good sales ploy to say arent you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons PM Ive Yeah thats it ME This one has channel volume and your channe and your power UI That could be a sales pitch PM We can just go for make it a selling point that it is just the basic ID Yeah ME Yeah UI Simple and Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah uh I brilliant ME Okay ID Alright ID Good ID And okay in closing cause we only have five minutes ID Well be meeting again in thirty minutes ID Um youll be working Poppy will be working on the lookandfeel design ID Wait a minute ID Is that right PM Mmhmm ID Yep and um the user interface design so this is where the trendy stuff comes in ID And youll be evaluating the product ID Um Poppy and Tara will have to work together using modelling clay ID And um your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen PM Okay ID Alright ID So anyone else have something to say PM Um I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something because even if that may not seem obvious to us if thats what the surveys brought out I think that we should probably go along with that ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah PM Um so I suppose thatll come out in our dev design development PM But youre happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ME Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ME Like f five different Mmhmm PM Y Yeah UI Yeah UI What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this ID five UI Um having the numbers kind of like not a bunch of grapes but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle UI Like grapes ME Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons its true UI Like thats kind of fruity or something ID Mmhmm UI Thats just Yeah ME Yeah PM We can have a look at those ideas yeah ID Yeah ME I guess what you i ideally youd kind of think of age markets as well ME So its a something that will you know appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds PM Yeah ME Something that your granny would want on her remote control ME Um and international tastes as well so Not easy PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Tricky PM A lot of things to consider ID Yeah ID Lots of yeah PM Hm ID Alright PM Okay ID Kay well stick to the fruit and veggie theme then ID Alright ID And um well reconvene in thirty minutes PM Okay UI Okay ID Kay ME Okay ID Bye PM Thank you ID Ill see you later ID Oh what did I just do ID Okay,"The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons. The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year, and says the material used is expected to be spongy. The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design, then finalizes a few decisions about the components, materials, and energy sources. The project manager closes the meeting, stating what each member's next task will be."
ID Okay ID Here we go ID Alright the agenda for thi oh ID Alright ID Um the agenda for this meeting is um well initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers ID And then we will evaluate it given the criteria that um that we gave gave it ID And um talk about our finances whether we were under or over our budget ID I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what weve made given our options ID And um evaluate the product as a group PM Okay ID And um So first well have the prototype presentation ID Do you need the um PowerPoint for this PM Um yeah PM I just got a few slides so show them ID Alright PM Thank you PM Do you want to present it UI Um This is what we came up with PM Yeah here we are UI Its a pretty simple design UI Its um based on a mango UI Yeah UI And we Yeah ID On PM Mango shape ID A mango ID Okay UI And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and thisll be the power point the on off button kind yeah PM The LED ID Oh ID Okay ME Im sorry ME What was the wheres the LED ID Oops UI Its in the middle of one of the little Rs ME Oh ME Okay UI And then the other one is the power UI And uh we just have a simple design UI We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palmheld and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb PM So its palmheld PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Notice you have a number ten button UI So you dont have to Oh that was a mistake wasnt it UI Right no thats a zero PM You just need the nought UI Take that one off ID Okay UI Sorry UI I was in charge of the numbers ID No problem ID Ah UI And this is just if youve got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus PM So one plus one would be eleven or Yeah because if you on your average um remote if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve you press one and then you go to channel one and then two then youd just go to channel two instead of twelve UI You can go one three or something ID Oh UI You press that first and then you go one three yeah ID You press a plus button ID Oh okay ID Ive never heard of that kind before UI Well we just thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and So the plus and then yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Oh theres no e okay PM So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve or two plus two is channel twenty two ID Oh ID I But Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ME Okay UI No no th all thats why we have all these numbers UI These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine ID Yeah but I mean if you press itll go to that channel right away UI Yeah ID Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards UI Oh no UI Uh the plus is only for if youre going past the number nine ID Yeah I know but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five channel sixty five if I press the six itll go to channel six and then Ill press the plus and then itll go to six and then put the five and itll go to sixty five ME Sixty UI You p Oh UI No you press the plus first UI I I well it doesnt we havent really s I wouldve thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler PM Oh PM Well I dont mind we can further define that ID I th Um Yeah it wouldnt be a problem UI Its a Yeah PM I wouldnt have thought itd be a problem that it went to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five UI Yeah ID But I was just wondering like as long as we realise thats what itll do PM But I suppose its not as snappy ME Well the there is a theres a delay on remotes I think UI Oops ME Where you can have it its like a five second input time UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM If you dont put it Yeah ME So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine UI Yeah PM Yeah that yeah ID Yeah ME As long as theres not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons PM Mmhmm UI Yeah UI So A channel PM Um And channel which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it like Its the bigger R ME Was there so on the top there is volume and Channel up volume up ME Okay cool ID C and V UI Just so we can flick Its in the middle of one of the little Rs ID Right where um wheres the power button ME Yeah ME Its the R ID Oh okay PM So its just like UI Yeah so its all accessible ID Yeah PM We deci Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought thats kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb UI Without m taking your hand off the remote ID Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Oh okay PM Uh e ergonomics are all considered ME Mmhmm ID Yeah UI And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well ID Ergonomic definitely ergonomic PM Yeah PM It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though UI Okay PM But yeah no I mean its a different movement so yeah UI Yeah PM Um and the feel of it I mean weve made this out of Play Doh which is representing the you know the rubber and the spongy rubberness ID The spon yeah UI Yeah PM Um cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this antiRSI um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it and it just feels feels different UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Bit of a stress ball feel UI Yeah PM Would you like to feel it yourselves ID Yes PM How it fits in the palm of your hand ID I would ID My goodness ID There you go PM Thanks PM And you ME Yes ID Genevieve ID Yeah ME Oh its nice ME Oh I think I killed the five ME I did ME I killed the four ID And something hmm ME Oh god PM O Okay as for the colours we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype ME Oh it smells good UI Of Play Doh yeah PM But were thinking that seeing as were having it in interchangeable casing anyway that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use PM Or the combination PM Um and were thinking to carryon with the fruit and vegetable theme the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit like banana could be black and yellow watermelon red and green or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish ID Oh right UI Cause itd be quite subtle and Yeah ID Yeah ID It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would PM Bananas more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black ID Okay yeah PM So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength PM I mean watermelon you know m probably appealing to the yeah seasonal ID Kinda Christmas you know UI Yeah yeah yeah PM Apple green brown more kinda trendy you know khaki Yeah ID Yeah UI The pomegranates kinda girly and funky kind of and then the vanillas more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor ID Cool PM Okay PM Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device I mean you dont need to use both hands one hand to hold this and type in with the other you can just use your thumb UI Yeah PM Um as we said the rubbers probably used for comfort and antiRSI and thats about it ID Alright thank you very much ID Good work everyone ME Bravo You want the I dont know what order it goes in ID Alright ID And so now that weve we have a prototype uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle PM Mmhmm ID So I have something Im going to Oh wait a minute ID Do you need to do a presentation first ID Yeah ID Im gonna check that out for a second ME I have one PM Mm go Feel I think ID What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry youre right ME Evaluation cri Okay ID Evaluation criteria is next in line ME Thats me ID Yeah ME Hello ME Oh there we go ME Okay ME Come on my computer ME Come on ME Sorry my computers giving me technical difficulties ID Just press um function eight again ME Should I press it again ME Last time I did that it sh Okay ME Youre right ID And then again I think ID One more time ME Oh ME Still not there ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe Ill just do it on right on the screen where you can see it ME Um were gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that weve just seen ME Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were um back to our kickoff meeting this morning ME Um and well evaluate as to whether weve s done what we set out to do ME Um and were gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false ME So basically the lower p the lower the points the better ME Okay so question number one ME Does the remote whoops ME Sorry ME Oh Im not gonna be able um Ill do it on the whiteboard ME I cant change it so Im g Im gonna ask you to push it down once ID Okay ME Ill write down our scores up on the Okay so number one ID Ooh ME Do we have a fancy lookandfeel UI Mm PM Weve been quite successful with the rubber coating and Yeah ID Yeah ID The look is a little bit more playful UI Well Yeah ME Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy but its definitely different ME Its not your traditional yeah ID Oh definitely different yeah PM I think the colour has a lot to do with it PM I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype arent the colours that I think we wouldve necessarily chosen ME Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Its not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red black and yellow and orange ID Oh you were only given red and black ID Oh okay UI Yeah so not very sleek and we dont wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey PM Um But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallicy finish or something Well I know know its for rubber ME Yeah UI So we want it to be stand out that way anyway ID Yeah ID Okay UI Yeah UI A metallicy finish we were thinking ME Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Polished PM I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy UI Okay Yeah ME Yeah ID Yeah ME I kinda I like the potato look ID Its mango ME Its very different PM Oh well potato mango fruit and veg UI We we were we were thinking about yeah ME Its what ID Its mango ME Oh sorry the mango the mango look PM Potatos fine ME Yeah it is fruit or vegetable depends on your mood PM Potatos fine PM Yeah PM Totally PM Its really adaptable ME So I myself would say a one or a two ID Yeah ID I would say two ID Personally UI I w Id say two I think ME Its a two ME Okay and p One being true PM For the fancy I uh two three UI Fanciness ID Yeah ME So Two ME Okay actu thats pro thats gonna get confusing like that UI Yeah ME Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ME So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative ID Yeah PM Yeah and the use of the rubber ME Use of the rubber the use of the LED UI Yeah PM For the antiRSI ID Yeah PM The LED use isnt particularly innovative and we dont have any scroll buttons its all pushbuttons theres no LCD control so if were thinking about the rest of the market its sort of probably halfway ME Isnt Mmhmm UI Mm ID Yeah PM In some aspects it is like we said ID Yeah ID Id say maybe three UI Ill go for three as well ME Yeah ME And I think I mean it its tough to say because we were we didnt want it to be any more innovative than this because then that wouldve defeated the purpose PM Yeah UI No ID Yeah we want it simple PM Though it was our specification UI Wouldnt be simple yeah ME So I mean I well put three but I think we actually reached our goal UI Yeah ID Yeah ME We didnt want it any more than that ME Okay question number three ME Uh will it be easy to use ID I think so PM Yeah UI Yeah very ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah UI I think one for that ME S Yeah I think its you cant really get confused with that ID Yeah PM Yeah ID One UI Yeah UI No ME I mean therell be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system ID Th The plus number thing UI Yeah thats the only thing yeah ME But once thats figured out it should be fine PM Yeah and perhaps the turning on but Mm ME Number four ME Is this a goodlooking remote ME Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly PM Again I think the colour comes into this UI Its definitely Yeah ID Yeah colour will definitely be a factor ME Mmhmm ID I think that the logo could be smaller PM Okay ID And maybe not such a prominent way UI But the Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent ID Maybe like at the bottom kind of PM Not in Dont worry ME Whoops ID Oh it just had to be on there I guess ME Should just not touch it UI Yeah ME This time its the three I killed ME I was just wondering if it should be like flatter ME Or Well Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit PM I suppose Ive got quite big hands ID I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand UI Yeah UI But you know what Ive just thought of there now UI What wheres it gonna sit in your living room UI Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ID Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat and then the rest is like round UI Yeah UI But then it wouldnt sit as comfortably in your hand ME Oh ME Thats true ID It would still be comfortable I think PM Thing is like that its not going anywhere particularly ID We c we could handle it I think ME Maybe it could it could be on the bottom so you wouldnt loo like if its flat here so it sits up UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Like that UI Oh that would be nice ID Ah itd fall over all the time though ID Itd be annoying PM Uh yeah its less um whats th ha UI Yeah ME I g If its weighted maybe PM H its got higher centre of gravity like that ME Details details ID Kay were done designing ME Okay ID Come on ME So is this a goodlooking remote ME Would we wanna show it off to our friends UI Three UI You would though cause its bit its more interesting than other remotes ME Yeah ID I think it was another colour and it was like I think itd look okay ID I think maybe a two ME Yeah ME I mean I gue yeah its personal taste but Yeah PM I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that but definitely in another colour Im not happy with those colours UI Yeah ME Okay so should we say two for that ID Sure PM Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Okay ME Uh question number five ME Whats um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ME Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy UI I think we have to market it in the right way that um to say that it is simplistic ME Mmhmm PM Yeah UI So people dont just see it and think uh this is so simplistic I dont want to spend twenty five Euros ID Yeah UI We have to market it ME Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it PM Yeah PM And the kinetic energy shakerstyley whoo ooh no UI And the kinetic energy part UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Shake it and the buttons fall off ID Durable UI Dont shake Oh no the plus PM But you know thosell be firmly on UI Youre use the zero ME No I guess I dont know much about the remote control industry how much your average sells for but I know I am arent I UI Make a new one ID But youre our Marketing Expert UI I think theyre about ten po ten pound arent they UI About ten pounds ME But you dont have to buy batteries UI Fifteen ME So in the long term this can actually save you money UI Yeah PM Mm yeah thats true ID Oh ME So well market it that way too ID Exactly PM Yeah ID Exactly ME So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options itll Yeah PM Good point ID Yeah ID I would give it a two still though PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Mm ME Okay number six ME Can someone read it out ME Or Um yeah PM Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user ID Mm UI Yeah ME So that was mainly that the statistics we said Mmhmm PM Yeah UI I think it does very well ID Oh yeah PM Because yeah because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channelchanging UI The zap yeah PM And its just you wont have to think about it ID Yeah PM You dont have to look down to find them PM Theyre clearly there easy to use ID Yeah ME Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff PM Simple UI Uh Yeah PM Yeah ME But theyre not you and I really PM Mm ME So ID Yeah ME Okay so one PM Yeah ME Okay ME Number seven ME C Heather could you push it down ME Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ME Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly ME Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ID We have the alarm system UI Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system the lights behind the and itll vibra Itll be again in the marketing PM It Yeah l lights on and or flash as well PM But I mean its not obviously obvious from the outside that thats gonna happen cause you cant s particularly see an alarm ID I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up UI Yeah UI The light it will ID Or or was it gonna make a noise UI But But both Yeah PM Yeah PM But when the alarms not yeah PM If you Yeah ID You press the button it makes a noise right ME It turns into a duck and starts quacking PM You could s Yeah ID Yeah ME Here I am ID Awesome UI Oh that would be brilliant ID Awesome UI Id be tempted to Yeah PM Well the thing is if it was had an alarm system I mean when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went ME Um Okay PM But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something there wouldnt be any point PM So you cant see the alarm but it would light up UI It would have to be in the market Yeah but you still couldnt see it ID I though w it was gonna make a noise PM Yeah PM Alarm but you cant see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself UI It would just be a little speaker on the back or something ID Okay ME We oh youre just explaining why its not on the prototype PM Yeah ME But yeah itll be there PM Yeah ME So we can we could say that We can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever m ever made this one will be easier to find ID Oh okay PM It w yeah ID Whoo ID Okay PM Sorry ID Yeah totally PM Yeah ME Okay ME Um Question number eight PM Sorry Heather PM That wasnt very clear ID No problem mm ME Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ME Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult ME So it has to be yeah its eas theyll pick it up and theyll know what to do ID Totally UI So the plu the plus w once thats written down on the page thatll be really simple wont it ME The plus thing needs to be worked on ID Yeah PM Yeah I think just because its weve decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use ME Yeah ME Well Do Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button UI Yeah ME So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least ID Yeah so its just like channel six six enter UI That kind of annoys me though when its zero six when you have to press I dont know why PM Mm ID Yeah but you dont have to press zeros ME You could just press six enter or one two enter UI Oh okay PM And or sixty six enter y Yeah I think thats probably more straightforward ID And then like twelve enter UI Right UI Alright aye ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah PM Good Ooh UI Yeah ME Um okay so we can well say yes its uh one UI Id say w yeah one UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Okay PM Mm ME Question number nine PM Oh ME Uh will it minimise the effects of RSI which was repeated strain injury UI Yeah PM Injury ME Um which affected over a quarter of users ME S Its soft and And people could Mmhmm UI Hmm ID I think so ID Its like right in the Your thumb might get a little bit uh Yeah UI But if youre zapping yeah PM Yeah thats what I was thinking UI I dont think it will f Yeah the biology PM We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we dont know about ID But it is soft PM Mmhmm ID And thats kind of what the um the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for RSI so maybe it is but Yeah UI Mm PM Mm PM Yeah UI Yeah ME I dont know what other options there are PM I think were getting thats true ME Could I mean you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger ME But theres not really any other options unless its like a keyboard PM Mm ME So I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah ME So one or two do you think UI I Id say t two PM I think yeah I think too UI Yeah ME Two okay ID Yeah ME Okay number ten ME Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ID Yes we did UI Yeah ME Now is the colour gonna be there even if its like vanilla ME Is the yellow Mmhmm UI N We we cant really do that because for example on the banana theme we cant have it as being yellow UI It wont stand out UI So n its not always gonna be the same colour ME It sounds like the colours something that we But I mean the yell yeah d yellows ugly though depending on the So I think well have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the RR ID Well yeah the colours are yellow and grey PM Yeah UI Gray yeah ID So it could be grey on the banana one UI Yeah could be grey ID Yeah UI Yeah thats right we didnt even rea Yeah PM Mm PM Yeah PM I think this is the the factor that weve been least successful in confronting ME Okay UI Perhaps a metallic or or like thats grey and it wouldnt be that expensive to have a little bit of metal ID Mm yeah UI No ME Yeah UI That isnt rubber ME And the buttons in the middle ME Okay PM Yeah ME So do you think thats more of a three then ME Three four PM Four I think ME Four PM Well I dont what do what Okay ME Well we have good reasons for it so we but we can still put a a four ID Hum UI Okay ME Okay and final question ME Um did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ME Current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess ID I would say so UI Following that briefing we did ID But maybe more like two cause theres no like pictures of fruit its just sort of naming it by a fruit UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah ID With the with the colours PM Like um the colour scheme names and stuff UI Yeah ME No uh are the plates interchangeable ME I think I missed a few they are UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ME So you can have banana and kiwi and okay UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME Okay so thats something thats kind of in the making too like maybe itll become more Mmhmm ID Thats fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates PM It is UI I think w yeah I think one UI Well that was our brief and we followed the brief UI Well we havent got a big banana but Oh yeah PM The thing is I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from I dont know if youd instantly say mango ID Be like Yeah UI No UI No ID Maybe if it was scented PM Oh yeah UI Oh that would be class PM There we go PM That would be great ID Yeah we have money for that ID Um Alright so based on this evaluation do we average them out sorta thing PM Um Okay ME Yes we do ME So I wh what was I gonna put for that ME A two for fashion ID Oh ID I would say two UI Yeah UI Two ME Okay so our average there five six eight ten eleven twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by eleven is Between okay UI Its Yeah ID One point nine or something PM Its Between one and two ID I dont know these things ID Um between one and two PM So thats pretty fantastic UI Close to two ME Um UI Yeah ME Yeah thats very good cause the highest we coulda got is one UI I got Yeah cause weve a four to bring down ID Alright ME Does that seem right then ME Okay PM Mm PM It seems like it should be more around two UI Uh aye ID Yeah UI Yeah UI Uh shouldve added five PM Do we have an online calculator ID Im attempting to do that right now PM Okay UI This is ID Yeah it is one point nine ID Ooh UI Yay PM Oh wow PM Well done ID Go Heather Pauls PM Well thats excellent ID Yeah ID Alright now with that over and done with our next step is to see if we are under budget ID And um my computers frozen ID And now its not ID Okay ID So um in our shared folder if everyone could go there right now um Im going to um steal a cable ME Sorry ME Are you gonna do that ME Okay ID Um its its um its an Excel file UI Is that the project document ID Oh PM Production costs UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Kay there we go ID Um production costs ID And um I have to access that as well PM It says it I think it just means that we cant add any more to it now ID One moment ID Kay so far Ive added what I think or what is going on ID Great ID Its blinking at me ID Its locked for editing ID Read only ID Im gonna open up a second one then cause its locked for editing ID I have the original in my um my email account ME Oh is it locked cause Im in it ID I dunno ME Or okay PM Have you have you completed it ID No PM Oh right ID No I was hoping that you guys could PM Okay PM Okay ID Um there we go ID Okay here we go ID So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing ID So um if you can look up at the screen um the large screen oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think PM Yeah ID Okay were using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros PM Yeah UI Oh right ID Um were using a regular chip PM Yeah ID Um its cur its double curved so its curved all around PM Double doublecurved yeah ID Thats another three ID Were already at five ID Um were using plastic and rubber so Good thing plastic is free were at eight PM Yeah ID Um S Yeah UI What about a special colour UI Are we using that ID I guess we should do it just for one kind PM Yeah ID So its like special colour well well have two colours right PM Yeah ID Well one colour for the case one colour for the buttons PM Mmhmm ID So we can Um we have push button interface so thats inexpensive UI Yeah ID And um we have a special colour for the button and we also have a special form ID And a special material UI And a special material UI Yeah PM Oof ID Which puts us just barely under budget ID Hurray PM Congratulations guys ME Mm ME S good ID Yeah ID Good work guys ID So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros UI Thats good ID Awesome ID And back to our PowerPoint ID So weve Kay ID Yes we are ID So we need to do a product evaluation again which is probably um I dunno ID A different extension of a Hmm PM Of the actual project rather than the product UI Yeah PM A project PM Is is yeah ID Yeah cause were talking about leadership teamwork PM So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it ID Yeah ID Alright so um Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity PM I think we were pushed ME Mmhmm ID Pushed for creativity PM I mean we werent really given a lot of time or materials yeah to go about our design task UI The ma Or materials UI Yeah PM So I think we couldve done with a bit more time ID Ye Okay ID So itd be like need more time and materials PM Yeah ID But you were allowed m creativity PM Yeah ID I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ Right ME Yeah and the conceptual and functional ME Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess but m When we can down to it UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the LCD screen and like solar power backup and everything then we wouldnt have been able to afford that UI Yeah ME Okay PM So that did limit creativity UI Creativity ID Right Okay Great PM Just resources ME Mmhmm PM But yeah PM The fruit and veg idea ID Leadership ID Is this me being like guys do you like me ME Yeah ID Um ME Good leadership I think we stayed on task UI Yeah PM Yeah we did ID Yeah PM Weve uh seeing as weve come out with what we intended PM A pro um a product within the budget PM I think thats a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way so you know I think its been fine ME Mmhmm ID Yeah ME And the timing was good ME We never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing so Was good teamwork UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Good timing ID Oop Okay PM And project manager of course ID Teamwork ID I think we worked great as a team PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah ME I think we are wellsuited to our roles UI Yeah PM Yeah ID Alright how were our means PM Um Yeah and more Play Doh cause that was all the red we had ID We needed more Play Doh colours UI Yeah ID Yeah PM So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype we wouldnt have been able to UI Yeah it c it mightve been bigger ME Oh really ME Okay ID But ever everything else was satisfactory ID Is that good Yeah ME Yeah ME The computer programmes are good UI Yeah ME The Yeah PM Yeah PM It could be really straightforward for the computer ME I dont think there was anything Yeah PM I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that UI Im actually not sure if Ive saved my presentations PM Mm ME Theyll probably still be there PM Uh me too PM Yeah ID New ideas found ID I dont really know what that means ME Um Im not sure new ideas found PM Well I think weve all learnt stuff from each other like the n um yeah UI Yeah UI Through discussion PM Just about each different PM Got new ideas from each other ID Hmm ME Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other which was cool UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Like based on marketing stuff and then youd say something about interface and yeah worked well PM Yeah ID Yeah UI And we were a able to modify each others ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Each others Mm ME Oh does it have smart materials by the way PM Sorry ME Does it have smart materials PM Oh yeah ME Oh yeah PM Well mm did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs UI If if it if it If it can be afforded ID Okay ID Well with that achieved our last slide is our closing slide ID Yes our costs are within budget PM Yes ID Its evaluated generally positively ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Mmhmm ID And um dont forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary ID Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea PM Uh UI Yay PM Fantastic ME By watching TV PM Okay brilliant ID Alright UI Yeah PM Thank you very much ID Okay bye ME Mm ME Conclusion ME Dadada,"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme. The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto. They average the scores and get 1.9. They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had. They close the meeting by thanking one another."
ID Okay ID Oh thats not gonna work ID Oh alright ID Okay ID Okay ID Um alright ME Uh uh um ID Ill just put that there ID Uh as you all know were here to create a brand new fantastic remote ID Uh Im Nick Debusk Im the Project Manager ID Uh well just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what youre doing what your what your role is um ID Go ahead ME Okay ME I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role ME In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and Ill be doing research to figure this out ME In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and Ill be doing marketing research on the web ME And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did ID Kay UI Hiya Im Ryan UI Um Im the User Interface Designer UI Um likewise Ive three different roles for each stage of design UI Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control UI Um in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the the product UI And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design what they might be looking for uh things like fashions what makes wha how were gonna make it special UI Thats about it PM Right PM Im Manuel and Im the Industrial Designer in in this project um PM In the functional design phase Im Ill be dealing mostly with the requirements um well discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on PM Um I suppose well work pretty much together on that one PM Um um in the conceptual design um Ill be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product UI Yeah PM And uh the detailed design in the detailed design Ill be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself um so were pretty much working together obviously on the design front here PM Okay ID Okay ID Um so weve got our opening our our agenda is the opening uh acquaintance which weve kinda done ID Uh tool training project plan discussion and then closing ID Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here ID Um so we are putting together a new remote control ID Um we want it to be something original ID Um of course were a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use ID Um weve got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um ID And w uh well um functional design um ID Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d lets just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go into how were gonna design it and and how were gonna do the detailing on it UI Yeah UI Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know change channels is its main function ID So we want it to be um a TV remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote UI Oh right UI I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one persons house ID Kay ME Mm UI But you know they all sorta have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming ID Mmhmm ID Kay UI I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I dont actually know PM Mm UI But is it just infrared UI Is that standard ID I I think yeah yeah r universal remote UI Ye yeah ID Um this is my first uh goround with creating a remote control so I think were all in the same boat here ME Huh ME Ours too ID Um Okay UI Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose em ME Mm UI So if theres a g a way of finding it quite easily I thought thatd be quite good quite a good feature ME Ch Like a tracking device ID So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh like a tracking device or or like a a It makes a noise theres a button on the TV that you press and Kay UI Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and itd beep PM Mm mm ME Mm UI Yeah PM Right ME Be good PM So Mm UI Generally all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance ID Yeah UI Just long ID Do we want so theyre kinda like long and rectangular UI Yeah ID Do we want something crazy UI Black usually ID You know we want something new thats gonna stand out UI Yeah ME Lot more modern UI I think so ID A m a modern so our remote should be Kay UI Maybe sorta spherical or something UI A ball ME Maybe like userfriendly like a little you know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard type thing UI Yeah UI People I thought maybe because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball and maybe the actual controls are inside or something ME Mm ID Um PM Well there are of course certain restrictions you cant have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here UI Yeah PM Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much um ME Mm PM What are we gonna build that thing out of PM How sturdy is it gonna be PM Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever have to buy one every half a year ID Okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy we want it to to hold up to somebodys child you know throwing it across the room or as you said people kinda throw it so ballshaped uh you know if it were ballshaped maybe then it Kay UI Yeah UI Yeah UI It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside ID Um so we want it to be modern fun sturdy um So our form and our function ID Um we want it to be um easy to find ID Um What else it what else do we want it to to do ID So we want it to be universal ID Its something that were supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros what they wanna make on it so ME Mm ME Also since were partners of the International Remote Control Association maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal ID Kay ME Thats more on the research end but the marketing ID So marketing you know how maybe uh marketing you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there ME Yeah ME And maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences cause maybe one wont apply to all of the countries were targeting ID Kay UI Ye Small PM Right ID Um Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ID Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there ID Some ideas ID We want it to be a b a ball you know well draw up well draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located UI Id I could draw sorta the ball idea UI My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you this is where its connected together and then when you open it out it could fol it could be maybe flip like a flip phone and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge thatll have to be the strongest part of it UI If that if we did use a hinge or if it was just two parts and then youd have just sorta you you you know your buttons UI Thing is inside I think sometimes remotes have too many buttons so maybe as simple as possible um as few buttons inside as possible UI Um I dunno whats the idea for UI Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it UI Its looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though to be fair UI But yeah ME Futuristic UI That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about Right it would almost be like a ball ID Uhhuh UI So that was just just an idea I had UI I dont know whether anybody else has other ideas PM Right PM One problem youd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of its stability really but of course since its a ball itll roll so wed have to have it flat on one side at least down here somewhere take away that part UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Maybe f yeah PM Thats one of the big issues UI Yeah thats g thats a good idea PM Also also you risk the hinges here UI Yeah PM Thats thats um a problem UI The idea it didnt have to necessarily be f a hinge that was just one idea though PM Thats thats interesting of course but thats of course a weak point yeah UI Yeah ID How would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ID What I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ID Not to put you on the spot but What did you say your title was again PM E No no uh uh PM N n Uh Im your Industrial Designer so i b well the point is that well maybe I dunno ID Youre the the Industrial Designer PM The shape is perhaps not the most ideal ID Okay PM As as stable as it is there must be a compromise between um stability and design here so UI Well I I suppose that things become design ME Mmhmm UI But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others UI I cant think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote maybe small sort of fatter ones but theres nothing being done sort of out of left field yeah ID Yeah ID Its not new its not innovative its you know everybody does long remote because its easy its its stable um UI Yeah ME Kay Ill draw something ID So if no go ahead ME What ME My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape you know like video games l so UI Yeah ME But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky ME We could also try to do the hinge thing so it could like flip out that way ME I dont know ME Thats my idea UI I think definitely doing something different is a good idea ME Yeah PM Mm UI I mean maybe design something thats sort of like uh I suppose not everybodys everybodys hands the same but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier ID Something with a grip ME Mm UI Yeah with a grip ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Because even I suppose even with the ball its it might not be the easiest to hold onto um UI It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah PM Mm ID So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better UI Like yeah ID But then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe we I feel like Im just shooting everything down here UI Yeah ME True UI Its d yeah UI I think its definitely got to be a a onehanded a onehanded job ME Mm ID Uh um Yeah ME Thats fine ME Youre the boss youre allowed to PM Well with the onehanded design you also have the the problem of the size w cause you know from cell phones they can be too small PM So if the remote is too small it if its small it probably looks better but may not be th as functional ME Yeah PM So for that theres So The question is also I dunno d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ID Okay so unfortunately weve got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it ID Um weve talked about our experiences with remote control and um weve got a couple ideas um ID Lets see here ID What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to ID So you know um s so its easier to hold onto that way UI Yeah ID Course thatll then remove some of our our ball ID Unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part ID So the grip is No that wouldnt work either um ID But if were gonna make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball anyways ID So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess um and then flat uh And then we have the problem with the hinge ID So if were flat on the bottom its not gonna roll away itll stay where we want ID Mm thats true PM Its probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway so I dont know if a lid is a good idea PM From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident uh the more we sell PM So its dont make it too stable uh ID So we dont have it flip open ID We just have a ball Okay so then we forget the ball UI But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then PM To the other design PM It looks cool ME Looks cool though ID It looks cool but its really not its not functional um ME Yeah PM Uh functional ID So weve got our sort of keyboard kind ID What if we flipped it around here so that it were um Sorry that doesnt look anything like what you had there ID Um so its up and down you hold it this way ID Course then its its like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points UI Yeah PM Right PM Right ID But its onehanded um PM Question is what makes those game pads functional PM W I think thats pretty much the form for full hand PM So its a round shape underneath that makes it comfy right makes it nice so thats the essential part ME Mm ID Yeah PM Except for that I think well not probably not get a get away from some longer design ID Yeah ME Right PM Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing ID Yeah because it doesnt have a cord like joysticks do PM You know all that dif batteries right and Batteries go weak as well so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it right PM So have to m show which is the front which is the back ID Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ID So that either way youre pointing it it would work PM I suppose you could do that PM O of course the more technology you stick in that the more itll cost so ID More expensive and yeah PM Course you can do that ID Kay ID Um True PM I mean of course itll be evident after a while or if you look at it itll itll be evident which way around to point it since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff but um its rather about an instinctual thing like you just grab it you dont have to s look at it you know which way around to point it UI Put it Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isnt a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had definite points PM Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work UI So if thats your thing and you got something like that instead and theres your s you kn you know which way youre gonna pointing it ME Yeah ID Kay ME Sorry to interrupt but we have a warning to finish UI Um Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting I think ID Are we out of time ME Yeah PM Mm ID Okay well just to finish up should we s go with this plan start making some Are good ideas what are not PM Lets PM Obviously Alright ID Uh ID Must finish now so ID And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want ME Mm ME Great ID Okay ID And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around be a little bit more prepared ID And uh alright good meeting,"The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project. The project manager then described the upcoming project. The team then discussed their experiences with remote controls. They also discussed the project budget and which features they would like to see in the remote control they are to create. The team discussed universal usage, how to find remotes when misplaced, shapes and colors, ball shaped remotes, marketing strategies, keyboards on remotes, and remote sizes."
ID Oh UI Du Uh we yes s Ive lo Ive done the role that I was asked to do anyway ID Okay ID Thanks for coming to this meeting ME Hm ID S how we doing on our remote ID We have some we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want ID Yeah UI I think ID Alright lets just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting ID See if I cant get things uh moving along here a little bit better ID Um Ill go over what we went over last time which shouldnt take long ID Then I believe each of you have a presentation ID Um Ive was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote what they want ID Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do um and how its going to do it hopefully ID And uh then well have the closing ID Um which well have forty minutes for ID Uh lets see the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what ID Im responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes uh and coming up with the final presentation ID Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert ID Shes gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants ID Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer ID And Manuel is the Industrial Designer ID So youre gonna come up with the ideas Ryan and youre gonna pick em apart ID Um we decided our remote uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want ID Um we want to be modern um fun different ID Uh it needs to be sturdy um easy to find so we gonna have that locator function ID Um and we want to be different ID Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas ID Ballshaped phone ID The keyboard shape ID Um we decided that it should probably be onehanded ID Something we could use with one hand ID Um and that was our last meeting ID So um why dont um Do each of you have a presentation ME Yep ID Okay ID Ill hand it off to you and um Does anyone do you wanna go first ME Sure ID So we can maybe see what uh what the people want ME What was it ME Function PM Eight ME F eight PM F eight ME Well ME How do I get it Oh right right right UI Slide show ID To go to the next one ID Yeah you click on that guy ME That one ID Yeah ME Okay ME Alright ME Well this is my report which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent ME Oh gosh Ive no idea ME G Okay UI Just press the arrow keys I think UI Usually goes to it ME Sorry I actually need to see something else on my screen ID Hit F eight again ME Yeah ID I think ME And then ME Again ID Yeah ID You want it to be on both screens or just just yours ME No I want something else on mine ME Is that possible ID Yeah but I think you have to hit escape ID And then you can Yeah ME Okay but now you dont have that ID Oh hit F eight again ME Sorry guys ID I know ID I did the same thing ID And then it should come up here shortly ID Kay ME So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and have something yeah ID I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ME Yeah ME Oh well ID Mm ID Im not sure ID You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think ME Yeah ME Its okay ME Okay ME Um so first of all the method that I used was by doing some marketing research by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted ME And then some internet research ME And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed ME And so I will show you some of the results from that which I think will be helpful ME Um okay here are some of the findings ME They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls ME And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly ME Which is a fairly significant number I would say ME And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy ME So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look I think thats definitely important ME Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user ME Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot ME And if anyone could clarify what that means ME Zap does that just mean like changing the channel UI Is is it j just just just using it yeah PM Just jus yeah ME Okay ME Um and fifty percent of the users say that theyre only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control ME And there was something else they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons ME And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all ME Of course channel selection is used the most frequently ME And then teletext was the next ME Volume and then power ME And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used ME So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button ME Um the biggest user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea ME They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote ME And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for RSI UI A repetitive strain injury ME What is it UI Just repetitive strain injury UI I think ME Okay UI Thats what I guess ME Okay ME And so bas okay ME Um as far as speech recognition goes um the younger group looks like theyre all for it ME From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more ME And it kind of just went down incrementally ME The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think its worth investing in this ME At least if were targeting the younger groups ME And so in conclusion ME Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct ME We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control ME Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore ME So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room ME Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons get rid of the ones that dont seem to be serving much purpose ME And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition ME And thats it ID Kay ID Very nice ID Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want what we should focus on ID Uh Wait can I look at that real quick ME Oh yeah ME Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed UI Yeah ME Kay UI Having just listened to what Corinne just said Ill draw on some of the things as well UI Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say UI Kay so Im just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design UI Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control UI And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change programme and operate an electronic device remotely UI I mean thats an obvious thing to say but its not attached to the device that you want to control UI Um I had some things sent to me UI Not very much UI To look at similar devices UI Um defined in some them UI And then the personal preferences that I will suggest UI Um we discussed a universal one UI Um like its just been brought up again then UI But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it um because youd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies UI Im not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself but you have to i theyre a nightmare to use UI You have to set them reset them to everything UI Um and that would only add buttons UI Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons UI So I think itd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for TVs UI Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications if if the aim is to get something thats unique in design UI Um Okay here heres just two pictures of remote controls UI Theyre just simple TV remote controls UI But one is uh usercentred UI That is the one on the left UI And you can straight away see theres less buttons UI And the other one is engineercentred where thats more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment its trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be usercentred UI Fewer buttons simpler to use and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is whats used maybe the other fifty percent the buttons that are used very rarely like programming they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where theyre hidden away UI And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across UI Um and finally um uh sort Ive sort of covered that our product I think should be user interface orientated UI Um Like I said to concentrate on TV remote control a universal remote might be too complex UI Um and as what it the major findings market researchers have said its the image and the appearance that people di dislike UI So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend UI And then and change the fashion of remote controls UI And thats it PM cable there PM Thank you ID What was your last conclusion on that one ID Focus on uh the i the image of it UI On something on the image of it UI Uh the f the actual design ID Kay ID Good ID Good PM Okay PM Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there PM Right PM So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it so um Im going to do a lot of the stuff on the board PM Um just This is the basic basic premise of a remote control PM Um the basic function is to send messages to another system PM Okay so much is clear PM An energy source feeds an integrated circuit like a chip that can compose messages PM Often in the form of infrared bits PM This is the most mostly used PM Um theres uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system PM Um parts are cheaper as well PM A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages PM This is where my people screwed up basically PM So Im going to explain that on the board rather PM Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there PM Well start with an energy source PM Right PM Um which is usually a battery right PM Since its not feasible to add a cable to that PM This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself PM Uh which can be buttons whatever which in fact controls a chip PM Right PM This is the user interface and there we have the chip PM Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp PM That sends out the signal PM Of course the signal differs accordingly PM Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp PM And Of course thats controlled the chip itself is controlled by the user interface PM The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well so that you know that its working basically PM You press something you get a response PM Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices PM Now this what were talking about here or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly PM The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered PM What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared the sending device basically the infrared lamp PM We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp PM Right PM These two are components that we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing PM Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device PM It c it doesnt have to be there PM This can be discussed as well PM The user interface PM Thats something we can also discuss PM Um as weve heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment PM Speech recognition um interface we dont know that PM Or if we just do the usual button thing PM Or we have a touch pad or something like that thats something we can discuss PM And of course the energy source PM Batteries PM Solar cells PM Who knows PM Of course its always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough PM But thats like I s I suppose rather up to marketing and not to to the industrial design department ID So we could the the the more complex we make it of course the more expensive But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote PM Expensive its gonna be get uh PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ID So possibly it might be worth the investment PM Right UI I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work UI Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if its on your phone ME Yeah ID I agree UI And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well ID Well I myself I find when you h when theres something like spee speech recognition ID Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something ID Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end and you say one for this and you find yours like you said saying the same thing over and over and over UI Yeah ID I find myself especially if Im in a crowd of people looking really silly UI Yeah ID So maybe if youre sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know you Volume up UI And wou I dont know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff UI If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting Yeah ID Volume down ID Change the channel you know channel up channel down ID I I dont know ME Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said theyd do it but probably a lot of them thats actually their parents money ME Like I dont know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves a fifteen year old you know UI I think As well itd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people ID Mmhmm ME Yeah UI But practically I dont think its Yeah ID Its a its a gimmick factor that they like at first and Okay UI Itll wear off ME Gets old yeah ID Um Lets see here UI Do you wanna put your cord back in ID Yeah I guess so PM Oh right ID Trade you PM go ID Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements ID Um the remotes only gonna be for the television which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated its more cost more costly ID And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people dont even use it ID I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons ME Mm ID So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem ID Um no teletext ID Um So we dont have to worry about that ID Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the fashion in electronics ID And our corporate colours are grey and yellow ID And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use ID Um from all all three of your uh presentations I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting ID Um We want something that looks good ID Um we want something thats simple ID We want something that you can find easily ID Um And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take ID Its gonna cost more ID S the young the younger people say that they like it PM Mmhmm ID But um its probably I would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time ID So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition ID Um And that way we can focus on our form UI I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing UI Is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster whatever you wanna call it UI Um that you you should put it back in UI Your remote UI But if you dont put it back in you press something like a little button on that and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something UI Just by infrared UI That shouldnt be too complex I wouldve thought ID Thatd be thatd be good if we were going with our our ball UI Yeah it would be quite good UI The ball could sit on a Yeah ID Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good ME Mm ID You know that could be the charger ID For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote ID And that would be or solar ID Or you know However however you wanted to go about it the holder could also be the charging unit UI Yeah ID Um With the locator button ID Um and if it were the ball youd no longer have to have a flat space on it UI Yeah ID Um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and Its gonna roll away PM Well you still do PM You s you still W yeah PM You put it on t on the couch table PM While youre watching its gonna roll off ME Rolls away yeah PM So thats not an issue really ID Um So I guess after the meeting well have some questionnaires ID And uh and some summaries for for whats going on ID Um then well take lunch ID Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work ID Um Ill do the minutes ID Uh lets see ID It looks like youre already on your way for uh working with the components ID Um chips the what chips we need and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot ID User interface concept we want it to be something simple UI Yeah ID Um Minimal number of buttons ID I guess our I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look you know UI Yeah PM Right PM Thats Mm ID Did you have time earlier to to work on that ID Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ME Not really UI Ill yeah Ill have a look try look at the actual appearance in the next break ID Kay UI I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately onehanded UI The ball is probably not a good idea ME Mm UI And even something thats held like that might be difficult ID Mmhmm UI So that I think it still has to be a variation UI On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring as plain as a rectangle ME Mm ID Um Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ID That way we could l I mean if it were if we were shooting for young guys then its um a certain look to the remote ID Or girls or older people ID Um Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ID That we would would wanna pick out UI D I dont know if that might cope with like the trendwatching ME Mm UI I find anything more on that ME Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting well have some info on that ID Kay ID So um we know that the remotes gonna have to be well just say weve got a colour scheme for it UI Yeah ID Um yellow and you know yellow its nice and bright with the buttons being grey or black ID And our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the the bottom or the you know UI Bottom perhaps yeah ID Um Maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort ID You know ID Um maybe we could flare it or something ID You know ID So its more of course this will look like a bone then ID go ahead and erase this ID Um Hope everyone memorised that uh Yeah UI You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones and the shapes that the theyve been going ME Mm ID Yeah UI Theyve gone from big brick block things which is a remote control is to sort of slinky small things ID Yeah everybodys got a mobile phone right ID Except for me now ID Uh But they are all you know mobile phones um theyve kind of taken a turn to where theyre really small UI Yeah ID Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time ME Mm PM Right ID But then again you dont want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in ID Um So weve got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what were what were stuck with ID Um Maybe we could go with a square or something ID Um Um you know with minimal number of buttons PM Hm ID I guess youve got you know one through nine ID For typing in your channels ID Uh youve got volume up and down ID Channel up and down ME Power ID Power ID Usually at the top ID Um a mute PM Thats the classical design ID Thats thats pretty much all you need I think ID Um A menu button maybe PM Right ID So you know ID If you if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the TV to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into TVs we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in press the menu button scroll up and down to select it ME Yeah PM Yeah ID Um Kay so Um Mmhmm PM Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad PM Its Talk about maybe f look at that from the side there maybe PM Which is technically the easiest option PM Would probably be like a scrolling little scrolling wheel like this PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Like a wheel on your mouse PM So PM Yeah sort of like that ID Sort of PM You can even if were coming from mice we can even add a click function where you in order to verify the information you just press it down PM Right ID S a good idea PM Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing if you wanna make it square for the looks of it then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing you add a little bulge down here PM Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on ID Mmhmm PM I know PM You know what Im getting at here fel look at it from the side ID Look g yeah ME Mmhmm ID Looks good PM Its like that PM Right PM Uh Then you hold it in your hand like this PM And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side UI Yes s To the thumb yeah ID To the thumb ID Yeah PM Right PM Mm UI Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important the smaller here PM Right PM You can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again sliding open UI Yeah PM With the lesser used functions on this part and then it slides into that part UI Behind UI Definitely PM And out UI just like o on a sort of side view UI Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better UI So you know you just sort of have your hand Yeah PM Mm well I was just thinking this this of course causes causes a problem um for left or righthanded people actually UI Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing UI Yeah thats also true PM So UI instantly sort of always going for the righthanded person PM Right UI But I mean the older so Righthanded yeah ID Yeah is everyone who in heres righthanded lefthanded ME Right ID You guys all righthanded PM Right ID Yeah ID So Im lefthanded but I so I can say that most things are designed for righthanded people ME Uhhuh PM Thats right ID Like the written language ID Or English ME Maybe you could buy like a special lefthanded version of the remote ID Maybe ID Ow ME Special order ID I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a righthanded p person ME Yeah ID Um but thats thats good ID Thats w I think weve got a kind of a good plan there ID Um At least for what buttons were gonna use ID Um So weve got uh I like the scroll the scroll action and the UI I mean Im just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had with the way that was more like that whereas this is just a onehanded thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb UI So youd have your youd put your hand into there with the thumb there UI And then your thumb would do youd have all the buttons sort of round here UI And that I think could work ID Yeah UI On any hand ID Kinda like holding a Yeah UI If you just had it like wrapped round there UI Left or right ME Mm PM Right PM That minimises it sizewise as well UI Minimise its size UI It could be you know really quite small PM Mm PM Then theres maybe another point of making it a twoinone kind of thing PM If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one PM You give it the full functions in here and just a couple of functions in there UI Yeah ME Hmm PM Like your zap zapping device is just u channels updown uh volume and onoff UI Zapping functions PM Thats it ME Could be good PM Maybe ID So two remotes in one ID But then would be easier to lose one or the other PM Thats right PM Means the big one has to be sufficiently big PM And perhaps heavy so you cant move it around PM Make it a piece of furniture ME Yeah yeah ID It actually is your coffee table PM yes PM Yes there you go PM Or a statue or something ID Okay ID Well we need to finish up here ID Um So for the next So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on youre watching trends to see what what kind of new information weve got going on ME Mmhmm UI Yep ID Um Manuel youre going to work on the components for for what were gonna use PM Right ID Lets go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand lets explore uh the the uh possibility of having the twopiece ID So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand PM Alright UI Yeah ID Um And Ryan you work on um how how well theyll work with the us with the user UI How well itll work yeah ID So both of those concepts ID And uh okay I think we made some good progress here PM Alright ID see you in I dunno ID I gu I guess well take lunch in about uh half an hour ID Or I guess well be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that well probably have another meeting UI Yeah PM Alright ID Okay,"The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls. The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive, to match the behavior of the user, to be easier to locate when misplaced, and not to cause RSI. The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition. The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by. The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design, the appearance of their remote, buttons, how to make an ergonomic remote, and the option to have a two-piece remote."
ID Okay ID Right ID Okay ID Alright ID Is everyone here ME Yep UI Yep ID Okay ID This is our conceptual design meeting ID And Ill just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes ID Um then each of you will have your presentation um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control ID And then well have uh forty minutes for finishing up ID Um Ill go through the mee through the minutes first ID Um we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available ID Um we decided that or we know that we need to use company colours company logo ID Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users ID Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before ID People thought their remotes were ugly um um that remotes zap a lot ID Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons ID Um and that they often lose the its easy to lose a remote ID Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple ID Um And uh some sort of locator ID Either a button or tracking device ID Um And that it should look different than whats out there ID Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition ID The younger people said they wanted it older people did not ID Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a gimmick that um would increasingly wear on the consumers nerves ID Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote ID Um the simple versus the um the complex ID The simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer ID Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a useroriented remote something simple ID Um and that we didnt wanna go with a universal remote because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity ID Um we would just have a TV remote ID Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote ID Have it s be something that looks different ID And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work ID Um from energy source um uh what we would use ID Batteries because we dont wanna have a a cable ID Um How that would power the remote and the lamp ID If we were to to have one ID Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the TV ID Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be ID Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someones hand ID And with a just a few buttons ID Just the basics ID And with a scrolling um function also ID Okay and I will leave that leave it at that ID So Marketing ME Okay ID Were watching trends ME Yep ME Can I have your cable please ID I suppose that you can have this ME Thanks ME Okay so I was looking at trendwatching ME Um unfortunately I wasnt given too much information ME I was given a brief executive summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at ME And then Ill just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that ME Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy lookandfeel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional lookandfeel design which I think weve kind of already discussed before ME Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative ME And again these are all things weve kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up ME And thirdly the remote would be easy to use ME As far as fashion update weve learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture ME So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can try ME Um and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel ME Okay so from that um as weve already said we need to focus on a fancy lookandfeel ME Um I think weve already discovered that its kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design ME But I think that even if its very subtle we need to kind of trick our consumers so they at least get the idea that theyre getting something thats new and modern and sleek and Whether its through the shape or the colours or all of that ME Um for technologically innovative weve talked about the tracking device ME We brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further ME And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those um that we could change a little bit ME We need to keep it simple have limited buttons which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for ME Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables ME I dont know I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable UI Oh it was sort of banana shaped ME Yeah ID A banana shape ME Yeah ME Right ME Or with exterior designs ME But my question is I mean the stereotypically speaking you kind of picture males with their remote controls and Im not sure how theyd feel about having fruity logos on the outside ME So maybe we could have something thats somewhat removable or I dont know different options for female male target groups ME And then the spongy feel ME I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology thats out there ME C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongyfeeling remote controls ME So thats that ID So possibly like a uh sorry just to butt in for a second PM Alright ID Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ME Thats what I was thinking yeah UI Those like yeah sort of spongy ones ID You have one with a flag and one with a banana and one thats a spongy feel to it ME Yeah ME So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings ID You can Mm various covers UI Whats it called UI Cust you personalised yeah ME Personalise your remote ID We could leave that to the cover department UI Yeah ME Mmhmm ID We all know theyve got nothing to do all day UI Okay UI Why cant I see the crazy UI Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to will use the consumer will use the actual device UI Um so Ive looked at some of the stuff I was sent um try and get some inspiration UI But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had UI Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions into such devices UI They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer and the machine responds accordingly UI Um okay UI Theres different ways of a user can use products l like a remote UI Um theres a graphical use where you you look at pictures and well on a screen UI A command line where you obviously type things in and you get a response UI Um and then it ju thats just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes UI You cant really see that picture well but theres various different remotes once again with lots of different buttons on making it more complicated UI So then I had a look at new products that are on the market UI Not necessarily remote controls but ones that youll recognise UI Um this is the voice there is a voice recognition remote control which can control mus multiple devices UI I have a there is a picture UI You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice UI Store up to eighty speech samples controls four devices TV cable satellite VCR DVD and audio UI And you can record your own v verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions UI So the technology is there UI Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting where there has scroll down functions on the side UI You can sort of just make those out UI And then on the right is obviously an iPod which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there and really is and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through UI That is a possibility UI And nothings simpler really UI Um then theres things like this which is a a a kids remote where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before UI So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch UI And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control UI So I dont know if theres a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components maybe it can have more components you know different remotes UI Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices as to what you know things you use UI Sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest volume down could become confused just as a V for volume UI Just little things like that which would need to be made clear in the design UI Um I think d carrying on from what Ive already said a user friendly remote with minimum buttons UI Maybe weve so suggested this twopart thing where if it was to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit UI And then just have the simple sort of handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote UI Um I dont it could be a graphical display the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus UI Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated UI And then the the handheld bit should be ergonomically designed UI And that is it UI Why am I Oh yeah UI Just UI Where are we UI Uh UI Just to sort of show you UI M theyve even got things like that UI Huge things UI Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah PM Thats industrial design for cranes stuff like that UI Yeah UI Yeah ME Dunno UI And that yeah PM Makes sense makes sense ID Notice the giant dog bone shape ID Also good for animals UI Yeah UI See UI things UI Whys my screen crazy PM Uh Well lets see PM Im going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior PM Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff in there PM Ive more information on possible materials um as well PM What we can and cannot do PM Um but lets just wait for this to load up and Ill show you what were talking about here PM Okay PM The details of the components design as you can see there what we have is the board main board of the remote control PM The underside thats pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip which is the what we were talking about this was is the device to recognise the signals the input and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal which later on is being is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um its getting and will do what you tell it PM Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself PM Its job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that key press into infrared light signals um that are received by the television PM When you press a key um you complete a specific connection PM The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed PM It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button PM Right PM Pretty clear PM Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light PM The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately PM This is the circuit board from the other side PM Um the lower part of it I dont know if you can see that properly with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over PM Um you can see the circuit board itself PM Thats the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market PM Um what you do is you have dont have cables but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board PM These are the actual keys that are being pressed PM They close the electric circuit PM That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side PM That would be behind here PM Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there PM Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it PM Um the way it works is that you have the keys here PM The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side which closes the circuit here PM And thus gives on the signal PM Now this is the simple version PM Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time PM We are talking something more complicated of course its going to be more expensive as well PM And not only that PM Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell PM Um Ive gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic rubber as well PM Um rubber that is used in these antistress balls PM So its pretty squishy PM That would that would serve that purpose ME Spongy PM Um we could also use wood or titanium ID Whats the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium PM Oh fya I dont have an information on that PM However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium so I assume Im I was given an okay to use it PM It certainly is an expensive material Im aware of that but I was given an okay PM But there are certain restrictions to certain materials PM Now lets first go through the list with the materials PM So we what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titanium PM Can also mix these PM Um as for the energy source um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting PM Um what we could use is or what I was offered or what we could use is a basic bateer battery PM Right PM Uh a dynamo PM Interestingly enough PM Um we could use solar cells PM Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy PM Such as like watches you know PM Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy PM So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really UI Mm PM You dont wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right PM Um solar cell is interesting PM May fail though every here and there UI Would you have to leave it by the window PM Mm UI yeah PM Yeah PM Or you know you lose it it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm UI Yeah PM Always the you But exactly ID Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go ME Y probably not yeah UI Yeah PM Um the kinetic energy thing um might work um but the same problem PM You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work PM So Id say what were stuck with really is um the basic battery PM Which also makes a base station basically obsolete PM We dont need that then PM Um However our interface options are pushbuttons PM In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert PM Um However weve discussed that scroll wheels are a better option PM And they are possible PM We have an okay for scroll wheels PM Okay PM Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod Ive one big objection and that is that we have to fit an LCD into the remote control as well PM This however may exclude certain um materials PM If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control then an LCD screen may be affected by the movement PM Hence we might not be able to put it in there PM So um Theres also restrictions to when it comes to the chip PM If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh setup that we that Ive just presented um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well PM I dont have any details to when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference PM Id rather say drop the titanium and therefore lets have a more sophisticated chip but thats not up to me to decide really PM So thats for the for the scroll wheel PM Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip so Id say rather not go for for that PM Lets see now PM Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control PM But obviously thats not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells I assume right ME Mm PM Or is anybody still alright UI Yeah ME No ME Hmm PM Alright UI Yeah PM Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume PM Um Um With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design PM We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much PM Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions UI Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff ME Mm ME Like a covering ME Yeah UI So I dont know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic UI But then where do people hold it UI Just all be sort of spongy ID Yeah ME The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts so they can remove it UI So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it like a screen UI Like the iPod PM You can have an LCD screen PM Um but therefore no rubber will be used UI Right PM Alright PM So plastic yes titanium yes but this will of course influence the form PM With plastic as I understand it you can use any form PM Um latex is tricky PM Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form PM So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular uh add an LCD screen and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium UI Yeah PM Or wood even PM Um if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic PM Add an LCD screen add a scroll wheel thatll be fine UI Yeah PM Or make it just pushbuttons PM Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options PM Maybe not the nicest feel PM Or not much originality really ID So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ID Or the rubbery we cannot PM With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add scroll wheels and we cannot add an LCD screen ID Kay ID Mm ME Mm ID Mm PM Thats the tricky thing UI Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen and then j just sort of that initial shape we had just which is uh sort of bananaesque UI So thats thing if we did it yellow ID Yeah UI And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit UI They wouldnt have any theyre just on the exterior UI They wouldnt be necessary to the actual shape of the thing ID Is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots PM S Certainly can be done yes PM Um yeah PM if that doesnt affect the functional side of it all UI Yeah PM Like say just the underside or so then it can be done PM I assume PM Yeah PM So The fruit design um How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control PM Say we dont make it p a particular fruit shape obviously but uh give it like the surface of an orange banana whatever ME Mm PM You name it UI Mm ID What about a smell PM Just designwise ID T to the remote PM Mm PM Nice one UI You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose UI In different ye yellows ME Bright citrus colours yeah PM Mm UI I dont suppose we have to stick to co Stick to the colours yeah PM Well we were supposed to stick to the company colours though thats yellow and grey ME Oh yeah ME Yellow and grey ID Yellow and grey PM So what have we lemon banana is Grapefruit is what wed go for when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps UI Mm grapefruit ID Grapefruit PM But mm ID I would say if I were to make a decision I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance UI Yeah ID Um Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruitminded remote buyer ME I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous like Well we kinda do yeah UI Yeah PM Well we have it bananashaped already kind of UI Yeah PM So Right UI Yeah ME And if its yellow UI and if it if it was done yellow which is a company colour ID Its its yellow PM I its yellow ID Its curved ME Grey buttons yeah PM Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ID Its sort of couple of couple of grey stripes UI Yeah ID We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over UI On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey ID It would look like a banana just sitting on their table ME Mm UI Yeah PM There you go ID Rather than rather th Maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit UI It could and then you could actually h put the bananashaped thing on the fruit bowl on the coffee table and then people would always know where it was ME Oh ME Nice ME Could look like a fruit bowl PM It could be an ape ID Could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl UI Yeah ID Hey we could have a variety of options here UI Yeah ME Kay PM Yeah ID Do you have more to your presentation PM Thats pretty much it PM I informed you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go ID Oh ID Okay ID Im gonna plug in here real quick PM Sure ID If I could PM Hang on PM There you go ID Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here ID Um ow ID Ow ME So is the two piece idea out ME Or have we not decided UI Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery UI And the base station might not be necessary ME Oh right okay PM Well we can still design a twopiece uh remote um without having a base having one of them be a base station but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions or you take out the smaller piece UI Yeah UI Yeah ME Mm PM We can still do that PM However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much ID Mmhmm PM So um which then as I understand it would probably limit the limit again the the the use of certain materials because they would be too expensive PM Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them or have an LCD screen and so on so on ME Mm PM Youd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there ME Mm PM But could be done of course ID Okay ID Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting ID Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source um the chiponprint and the case ID Probably case um material ID And probably a shape also ID Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is ID And what kind of supplements well have ID Um Energy source I think weve I think weve decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet PM Right ID And we have five minutes PM Okay when it comes to the chiponprint as I said the the more advanced features you want um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive PM Uh if you want just a normal button version the chiponprint is gonna be a cheap one ME Mm PM Right ID Kay ID So Um I guess we should pick the case then ID If we go with the plasticky case or the the plastic case um then the chiponprint is still kind of we could have either or ID We could have a complex one or a a noncomplex PM Yeah ID But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ME Well what about what you said like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic UI Just just maybe yeah UI Just a little bit of ID Okay ID So we would we would have the LCD screen PM as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls yes ID Kay ID So I guess the case would be plastic with Perhaps thats not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it ID Its more of a su its more of a supplement maybe UI Yeah ME Yeah PM M more of a l lamination perhaps UI Yeah ME So then for the scroll are we going for the iPod type UI Yeah I think so ME Yeah ME Okay ID Which will require a more expensive chiponprint right PM Yes PM It does ID Kay ID So I guess that is that is that about it ID So we have a good idea of what were gonna need to to do on this PM Right ID Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes ID Um Heres whats gonna be going on ID Um Um Ryan youll be working on the user interface design ID Um Manuel youll be working on the lookandfeel design PM Right ID Corrine well want a product evaluation ID And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype ID Which should go along well with your lookandfeel design and your interface ID So that basically just be working on the prototype uh well accomplish your other two actions ID Alright ID Okay ID Lets do it,"The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel, are technologically innovative, easy to use, include a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy in feel. The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized, and is not rectangular. The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote, an iPod, and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components, energy sources, and materials. The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. The team then discussed and decided what components, materials, and energy sources to use."
ID Yep ID Soon as I get this ID Okay ID This is our last meeting ID Um Ill go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting ID Uh and then well have a the prototype presentation ID Um then we will um do an evaluation ID Uh or well see what what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation ID Then well go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget ID Um then well do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that well need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line ID Um lets see minutes from the last meeting ID Um we looked at uh the the trends ID We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy lookandfeel ID It was twice as important as anything else ID Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles ID Um and a spongy feel ID So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype ID Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity ID Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote ID Um looking at other other devices ID Um the iPod we really liked the look of that ID Um we also had uh the kids remote for a simple idea ID Um a two part remote which was what were were originally looking at ID Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use ID But I think weve still decided not to go with that ID Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote ID Um and basically how what were making for the prototype ID So Im going to leave it at that and let you guys take over UI The prototype discussion ID The prototype yeah ID Do you need a this UI No ID Okay UI There is our remo the banana PM Can try to plug that in there but Right UI Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow UI Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned its basically designed around a banana UI Um but it would be held in such a fashion where it is obviously it wouldnt be that floppy cause this would be hard plastic UI These would be like the rubber the rubber grips UI So thats so that would hopefully help with grip or like the ergonomics of it UI Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel UI You have to use your imagination a little bit UI And this here represents the screen where you where youd go through ID Very nice UI And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod where that one way ch through channels that way th other way through channels UI Volume up and down UI And then to access the more complicated functions youd you sorta go you press that and go through the menus UI Its that that simple UI That just represents the infrared uh beam UI Thats a simple on and off switch UI Um I dont know we could use the voice UI T that blue bits should be yellow d that thatd be where the batteries would be I suppose UI And um thats about it UI Its as simple as you we could make it really UI Is there anything you want to add PM Thats what we have there PM Thats plastic PM Plastic covered with rubber PM We might uh add some more underneath here PM Maybe give it give it a form PM I mean youre supposed to hold it like that but um just if you grab it take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah UI Yeah UI Doesnt make much make much difference ID Mmhmm UI You could work lefthanded or righthanded I suppose PM Exactly use both PM Might as well think about Th think about the button as well UI T the actual thing might be smaller UI Yeah PM Like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all ID What but whats that button UI Just the on and off PM Its a quick onoff button ID Uh kay PM Thats um yeah I think its pretty important PM So you dont have to fiddle with that ID Kay PM Right PM Um thats not um Id say a bit smaller would probably be nice UI Yeah PM You wanna play with that over there PM There you go UI Its you know its flimsy cause its made out of heavy PlayDoh but And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose ID Would you like to uh Well done PM Right ME Pretty impressive ME Kind of a banana UI With the scroll and the LCD ID Well luckily we are going to find out ID Or not luckily ID Um do you have a marketing presentation for us ME I do ME Okay ME You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria ME Um ME Okay ME So first Ill just discuss some of the criteria that I found ME Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier ME And then well do a group evaluation of the prototype ME And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did ME Um so the criteria were gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier ME So were gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale ME And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that ME With seven being false we did not achieve that ME Okay ME So for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ID I think its definitely different than anything else out there ME Mm UI Yeah ID So if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes I would say I would say most definitely UI I would ID Its bright UI Its bright UI Its Its curved ID It still has your traditional black UI Its not theres no sharp angles to it ID Yep not angular ME Mm PM Id say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes thats definitely more beautiful than your average PM However the colour we dont have a say in that ME Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit UI Some people might say it PM That has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company UI Yeah ID Mm PM So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly definitely ME Thats true ID Yep ME Yeah UI Yeah PM S nothing you can say about that PM I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form UI Yeah PM But Right ID Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form PM Right PM Its different PM You dont want your uh three feet huge LCD dis display in your living room thats hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that ME Um okay so do you think since we This was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ME Does that sound good PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah ME What do you think ME Three ME Four ID I would say four ME Five ME Four is fair PM Yeah ME Okay ID Very noncommittal four ME Okay the second one ME Did we make it simple for new users PM Its very intuitive I think yeah UI Yeah UI I think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had PM S give it a one ME One kay ID Yeah ME Okay ME Um do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users UI Uh yeah ME Id say that So one UI Cause weve weve brought it down to basically four controls most common which are channel and volume PM Right ID Mmhmm UI And then the other ones are just a matter of just going just scrolling further ID S scrolling through and selecting a few UI Yeah PM Right PM So thats a one ME Yeah ID I think thats a one ME Okay ME Okay um the fourth one ME How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ME One of the number one complaints PM Something that big and that yellow you just dont lose anymore UI Yeah ME Whether you want to or not youre not gonna lose it UI Its bright yellow UI Bright yellows hard to lose UI But um if we were to if we were that the speech recognition UI That we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing UI That was what wed wed mentioned ID So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could And it is quite bright and Uh Yeah UI Just just to use to find it when it was lost UI But like I said like I dont think youd lose something so yellow so easily PM Oops UI And its not gonna fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things PM Hmm UI Thats gonna be a difficult shape to Yeah PM Well what S Mm UI Maybe in the middle again three or four or something ME Okay UI I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose I mean a million ways UI You can pick it up and walk away with it and then youve lost it ME Thats true ID But if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit I think ME Mm PM Oh yeah UI Yeah PM You probably Mm ID Probably two ID You know ID If we eliminate the fact that you know its impossible to guarantee that its not gonna be lost then Id say two UI Yeah ID With the speech recognition which of course may be changed depending on budget UI Yeah PM Y you could add an extra feature actually PM Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television UI Yeah PM We could add that but thats nothing we have thought of so far ID Which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a Some sort of proximity Pray that you dont accidentally lose that piece PM Yes UI Yeah true UI But I mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have ME Annoying alarm or something ME Yeah PM Its its Um the its based on this anti antitheft technology for suitcases and stuff where you have one piece thats attached to your luggage another piece that starts beeping UI Theyre cheap UI So it cant be that expensive UI Yeah PM That cant cost much UI Yeah PM So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your TV and the other Right UI stick it on the TV PM Thatd be tough then PM Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television yeah PM Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control UI Yeah ME So ME Are we adding one of these two features PM Lets add one of those features and say yes ME gonna say okay ID Okay ME So were back to a one ME Or a two UI Two PM Two ME Two kay ID Two ME Okay ME Are we technologically innovative PM Uh Its all just Its all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right UI Id say so UI Uh dont get many mo remote controls with screens on UI Yeah its stolen technology ME From iPod yeah ID Its But theres not a lot of yellow theres not a lotta yellow UI But we have ME But for remotes yeah ID Course that wasnt really we were kinda forced to take that colour UI Fa cause its stolen ME Two ME Three ID I dont know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth UI No maybe not PM Yeah not really ME But how many remotes do you see like this ME Not so many ID If we added the screaming factor then we go up PM Right ID Um I would say were probably at four ME Really ME Okay ME Thats gonna hurt us ME Okay ME Um spongy material PM Yeah well you have that kind of sort of ID We have some spongy yeah UI Yeah as much as as needed I think ME Kay PM Its not a one though ID No PM One would be the whole thing to fold and stuff ID Yeah ID Because its only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back PM Yeah UI Yeah PM So thats a four at most ID Probably a four at most ME And lastly did we put the fashion in electronics ID Possibly even a five PM Y yes ME Id say we did UI Yeah ID If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda you betcha PM More Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the LCD and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is UI Yeah UI On the Yeah ID Its true UI Be what we were told and theyd say yeah definitely ME Kay ME Alright ME Now we just gotta calculate ME Six eight twelve sixteen ME Seventeen divided by s Eight ID Seven is Two point two point four UI Is that some long division UI No ME Well I havent done math in years ID Something ME What two I dunno UI Just Im sure theres a ME Okay well say two point four two ME Right ME How does that look PM Im impressed PM I cant do that without a calculator UI No I cant do long very impressive ME Its been a while ID And what what is the acceptable criteria ID Is there like a scale that we have to hit ME Oh no ME They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically ID Alright then ME So thats that ID Okay ID Well lets see ID Now we get to do the budget numbers ID You didnt know that you were gonna have a budget ID But we do ID Okay UI Yeah UI Yeah so UI Youd been going a long time dividing that UI Its two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on ME Oh my god ME Okay UI Two point four two basically ME Yeah well go with that ME Not too shabby ID So I have here an Yeah PM Fifty percent youre kidding PM P Its too much ID We want a fifty percent profit on this ID Oh you cant really see that very well UI Charge about three hundred quid for it ID Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us ID Okay so Well lets see PM Um Uh Battery ID The f the Wonder if I can make this What the Oh it wont let me do that ID Okay ID Alright so at top I dont know if you guys can read that or not ID I cant cause I dont have my glasses on but so weve got the energy source ID Theres uh four five six categories ID We have energy source electronics case ID Then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements ID Okay so Uh first of all energy source we picked battery ID Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ID Probably some e either two or four PM Two ID Two ID Like it PM At four its gonna be too heavy so that thats not our problem PM People can change it every month PM They wont know until after they bought it ID Excellent ID This is consumerism ID Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chiponprint regular chiponprint advanced chiponprint sample sensor sample speaker UI Were advanced chip are we PM Thats the advanced chiponprint yeah ID Kay we have one of those ID Kay then the case is a Probably its double curved PM Double curved yes ID Case materials are plastic PM Plastic ID Um I guess its two since one for the top one for the bottom PM N no ID Is that right or is it just one PM No thats just one ID Maybe its one because of the Kay PM Its just one mo single mould we can do that UI Yeah yeah ME Right ID I guess it doesnt matter cause the price on that one is zero which is nice PM Exactly right ME Oh ID Special colour PM Thats not a special colour ME Bright yellow PM Its a specially ugly colour but its not special ID Interface type ID We have pushbutton scrollwheel interface integrated scrollwheel pushbutton and an LCD display UI S Thats Yeah PM S Yes unfortunately ID So we actually have the LCD display and then is it the integrated or is it Yeah UI And then Id say the integrated ID Kay ID Button supplement ID Special colour UI Mm ID Um special form ID Special material PM We could of course make the buttons wood PM Say mahogany or so Mmhmm or titanium ME Itd look really lovely ID Or titanium ME Yeah ID They cost us all the same UI remote control PM Uh just Yeah thats too much ID Well we only have one button so really we shouldnt be charged we shouldnt be charged anything for the the button supplements UI No thats getting a bit tiny ID Um Okay UI Yeah UI Id ignore that ME Leave it blank ID Were gonna leave that one blank because we run on a LCD and scroll ID So our total is fifteen point five ID Which I believe is by three Euros over PM Its hard to believe PM So well go for the hand dynamo huh ID So the only thing better than um a bananashaped remote is one that you shake UI If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button weve got on UI And just had a scroll wheel interface UI And the LCD display UI I suppose the LCD C displays the one thats pushing it up a bit though ID Yeah cause the Well cause we have to have both right UI Yeah PM I mean lets lets face it it also depends on the software on the on the television UI Yeah PM You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen ID Mmhmm PM So s yeah lets take away the Yeah UI Yeah you could maybe take out the LCD dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the TV itself PM Yeah PM Right ID So we may not need the LCD display UI Uh that is possible yeah PM Right PM We may not need it PM There you go ID Well there we go PM Perfect UI There we go ID Twelve point five ME Perfect ID Okay ID So we just remove our screen here UI Screen UI Make it a bigger dial UI Easier to use UI Even easier to use then ID Besides look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote PM Okay the So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go ID Back to the design room boys ME Whats the blue part PM central UI That was just we ran out of yellow ME Oh thats the batteries PM Oh thats just yeah ME Okay PM There you go UI There you go PM Oops UI Even simpler ME Looks more like a banana UI Yeah UI For all those fruit lovers out there PM There you go PM One more criteria ID Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro ID Was no ID We redesigned it UI Yeah ID Now its yes ID Next slide ID Project evaluation ID Uh project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found ID Um So I guess that Lets see here ID I think that perhaps the project evaluations just supposed to be completed by me ID But Id like to hear your thoughts ME Trying to fill in some time there PM Fair enough ID Uh h what did you think of our project process UI I think we did yeah I think we did quite well PM Great PM Yeah UI Um Yeah ID Good ME Good teamwork PM Just half a day you have a remote PM There you go UI Right from the start of the day ID Yeah I think we st we started off a little little weak UI We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought ID Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning ID Um um But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing ID Um room for creativity ID There was that ID Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things ID Um you guys worked together well as a team ID And um the means ID Which was the whiteboard and the pens UI Yeah UI Weve used the whiteboard PM Super super ID I had some problem with the pen I think but minus your p Well Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired ME Minus your PowerPoint fiasco PM Well thats not my fault PM Thats obviously the people I work for uh that work for me uh theyve just you know Heads are gonna roll believe me ME No I know ME Im yeah ME Incom Mm PM Yes yes ID Okay ID N new ideas found ID Um Yes for the remote ME Kinda ID Maybe no not f for technology UI Technology used ID Alright ID Closing ID Costs are within the budget ID Project is evaluated ID Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary ID Thats it UI Excellent ID And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting ID Actually ID Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up ME We might have a while though ID And then well have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that ID But thats the end of our meeting,"The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana. The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. The team found that, although the overall design of the prototype was attractive, its yellow color was ugly. The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them."
UI Okay ME Or you get it ME Okay UI No I dont think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length UI Okay and then PM So we uh we will wait for Anna a few minutes UI Yeah s yeah um ME Mm ME Yours is well Yeah but the the mic should not Yeah UI I think you can put anywhere you want actually UI I thin Its not a directional mic anyway PM I think it should work like this UI Uh PM So I will try to get my presentation running UI Yeah PM Mm ME Mm ME Cant help you with that UI Last PM Its no matter ME Okay its y yeah PM No problem PM Ah yes ME Right UI Okay ME Then press uh al This UI Okay PM I dont know ME You know PM Just try UI Kay PM On this normal Good ME Oh oh UI Alt F five PM Doesnt appear on the screen here ME Right well Wow PM Oh ME Amazing ME Its working PM Okay PM Thank you PM Uh ID Hold that PM Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your Somewhere ID Okay ID Okay ID Mm PM So good morning everyone PM Um Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project PM I hope you all have been uh updated about it ME Yeah PM Good UI So UI Yes PM So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here PM Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other PM See what our roles are in this project PM So um We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well learn from each others plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I dont know whether you worked with them before PM Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan PM You all know I hope how its about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design ID Mmhmm UI Total PM Uh then we will uh discuss uh well how it should be and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like PM And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting PM So PM Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control PM Um We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original PM Be uh we want to be distinguished mm PM People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think well thats the product I I need PM So it needs to be trendy PM I mean trendy is what people want so then I w they will buy our product PM But then uh it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that PM So the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase PM Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design PM And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape PM Alright but first we will do some uh tool training PM In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a whiteboard UI Whitebo Yeah you can start it you know ID Mmhmm PM And um well it should work uh Ive read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar PM I didnt find out yet how it work but maybe one of you did so Um Yes ME Under documents in the shared folder ME Okay PM Do Do we have to say something about that PM I I Im not fully updated about this shared folder uh ME Yeah I guess well have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share ME And uh yeah PM Yes well we will then find out ho how it works ME Yes PM Um PM Well this seems to me yes some computer program but I didnt find it yet PM So well come to that later PM So uh now we will try out the whiteboard we have here PM So I would suggest uh Well yes um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way ME Each of us is going PM I Im not really sure how this works but Yes a good idea Mael ME Okay shall I start ID Mm ID Yeah ID I think for us its just like a normal whiteboard but theyll be recording what we write down ME So i But its Actually I think I cannot go with uh Yeah UI No they will record through that UI Theres a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make ID Mm ID Mm ID But for us its just like a normal whiteboard PM Okay UI Yeah PM Kay PM You you D doesnt it work PM Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna maybe you can start ID Mmhmm PM Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right ID I have to draw PM So um L Why dont you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the whiteboard ID M my my favourite animal ID Sorry this is all tangled up here PM Oh I see uh Yeah ID Thats better UI Yeah PM Yes PM Mm PM So draw it PM We will try to guess what it is ID Mmhmm ID Im a very bad drawer ID Weird ID Um ID Youre not gonna be able to guess from my drawing ID Im a bad drawer ID Okay PM Mm ID Theyre ears by the way UI s a cat ID No ID Um close though ID Okay so like a pet animal ME Okay ID Like a cat UI Yeah PM Its like a cat so I guess its a cat ID No not a cat though PM What is this now UI Ah you forget about it ME Youre on the knife UI Yeah uh I think its fine UI I just dont want to carry it off UI Man this wires eh UI We need a wireless microphone UI You know UI Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that PM So thats the cat ID Okay ID So ID Its not a cat its a dog PM Oh UI So ME Mael PM Its a dog ID Yes PM So but thats also kind of cat isnt it UI Oh the dog doesnt have a tail ID Its got a tail then PM B bo both predators UI Yeah sure yeah ID Yeah yeah UI I thought so UI The dogs have a tail PM So thank you ID So do cats PM Uh d did you uh work out cord ID And you guessed cats without a tail UI Yeah ME Yeah I think I will go without without it right ID Okay PM Okay UI Itll still not extend right UI Its not up to that ID Okay there you go ID So what favourite characteristics ID Uh ID Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun ID A horse UI Its a horse ID This is why youre the designer ID And Im marketing PM Yes PM Yes yes this is Yes definitely a horse PM Yes PM Oh very good PM So I suppose it Yes ID Ah Mmhmm UI Ah I think you can put that ID Thats it ID A blue and black zebra PM Can you can meet them in Africa I think PM Yes PM Very good PM So Ma Matthew ID The very rare blue zebras ID Yes UI Ill tell to get it off my Uh UI Mmhmm PM So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael ID You got a lot of room here ID You can probably reach UI Oh y its not for that ID No UI No UI Okay UI Yeah UI So what should I draw UI Mm UI He has already to do cat ID I took a dog ID Um ID A mouse PM This looks likes a cat who has been driven over ID Okay ME Yeah ME And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics right ID Mmhmm PM Yes the moustache ME So Uh yeah PM Thats thats definitely a cat ID Mmhmm ME And i Th They like to sleep thats why you said you they are like this ME Yeah PM Its quite you know relaxed situation PM Yes ID Mmhmm PM Yes okay ME She has the small legs PM Th thank you Matthew ME Yeah ME Thank you Matthew ID Its a very big rat ME Perfect ID Or a very small cat ME Oh a rat okay PM Yes this is certain uh some contribution to our project ME And you A bird ID Mm kay ID Your turn PM So PM Lets see PM Which animal has not been drawn yet PM So youve all drawn land animals so why not draw an animal from the water ME Okay in the water ID Ah I dont know what that is ID Its a bit Its a bit hard to guess ME Mm ME Yeah PM Mm UI So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ME Put it colours ME Maybe it would help us ID Yeah PM Yes ME With different pen widths ID Mmhmm Oh its a shark now PM So Oh yes why not ME Ah its a shark yeah PM Good idea UI Ah its a baby shark it looks to me you know its going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish no ID Mm ME Oh ID Now its a swordfish PM Why not ME You have some in in Australia right PM A swordfish ID Swordfish ME Yeah ID Um maybe ME I dunno ID Ive never seen one no ME Oh well ME Yeah PM I hope it still works ME Perfect PM So W Well this uh this tool seemed to work ME So I dunno if we need to spend time on that actually But uh Yeah exactly yeah UI You should go for the next one it seems to me ID Mmhmm PM Lets continue to uh to the real stuff ME Wow PM Um our project uh finance uh thing PM Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product UI Twenty four ME Yeah ME Per remote control yeah ID Mm ME Per project PM Yes PM Okay PM Um more interesting for our company of course p uh profit aim about fifty million Euro PM So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things PM Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America maybe some uh Asian countries UI Ah yeah the sale man four million PM Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents ME So its half of the selling price if I am good in mathematics PM Yes of course PM Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit huh ME Of course UI They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit ID Mm PM You all have to be paid ID Mm PM Excuse me ME Oh youre g very good in mathematics UI Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button ID Yes PM Yes indeed ME Four million PM So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim I think ME Yeah PM So that about finance PM And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point it has to be original it has to be trendy it has to be user friendly PM Um maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Yes well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control ID Mm ID Yeah UI Yeah s and it depends what application you are using it for ID Mm UI You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set PM We wer we were thinking television PM Uh ID Mm UI So you need to record the channels ID Mm ID Yeah PM Mmhmm UI You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way Uh And Uh and Marketing PM Yes yes ID Mm PM Th th thats very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number especially when you have a lot of channels ID Mm ID Mm ME And uh just before starting the detailed discussion maybe we You are the marketing guy ME Or th So you are the marketing ID Im marketing ID Yep ME And you are in the u use user interface uh design UI Yeah PM Yes ME So just yeah I wanted to to be sure UI Yeah UI Sure ME And I Im the the industrial designer okay ID Mmhmm PM Yes ME Because I I dont know you very well actually but yeah UI Oh UI Im Matthew ME Okay UI You know ME Mael UI Matth s uh Anna ME Happy to meet you ID Anna ME Okay ME Its very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face UI And um uh Matthew yeah PM A and Im Nanne UI I thi think you know me yeah PM So Yes UI right yeah PM So PM Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well to specify in this first phase of of the project UI So ME So mm So I Like what ID Mm UI So And uh youd need the usual ones like the changing the volume changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things PM So the browse function as you m mentioned ID Mm ID Yeah ID Oth yeah PM Yes PM Yeah UI Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that so Yeah IPO or PM Yes ID Mm ME Like internet on the on TV ID Mm UI Now we are looking for television things or IP UI For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up ME Yeah ID Mm ID But we cant really design for something that hasnt been invented yet UI Yeah UI Ah its its its its coming up actually UI The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up PM Mm well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should I think think this over uh w espec what what functionality ME Actually yeah w Of course and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities we need to know what are the user requirements UI Lets Lets take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know you you sell their product as well as your product with them you know ID Mm ID Yeah ME Um then if they need internet then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh TV over IP PM Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Mm ID Yeah ME But before Yeah but w w we want to design a new one ID But Ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions the volume the different channels so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use PM Mm mm mm PM Keep k keep in mind i its a its a twenty five Euro unit so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out I think PM So twenty five Euro you expect a quite well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control ID Mm ID Mm ID Mm ID So try and get TV manufacturers to Mmhmm UI Yeah UI No its okay yeah I understand ME Mm UI So we need some numbering buttons some teletext things and then um Yeah ME Yeah ME The Yeah the main is browsing PM Yes but but but ab about the spec the buttons the buttons uh that will be on it ME Yeah PM I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting UI Yeah PM Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting UI Okay PM So So you know now the basic the basic things UI Okay we are alread mm ME Okay UI Mm UI Yeah PM And well just just for the next meeting um well uh you wor yes work on a design keep it general I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions UI L Yeah sure ME Mmhmm PM So Um you will be working on on technical function design so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well think about requirements eh ID Mmhmm PM Does it need internet or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface UI Stam ID Yeah PM So uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication ID Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Okay PM So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh ME Perfect PM K keep it in mind,"The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. He starts talking about the product they are to design, a remote control which should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The general outline of the project will be the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard, and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it. The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance, which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. This includes the basics such as on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume and record button(s). At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder, but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on."
UI Okay PM So I see all everybodys here kay ID Mmhmm ME Yep PM And we can start meeting UI Okay ID Whats the agenda for this meeting PM The I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you ID Okay PM Um as you can see here ME Perfect PM So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you ID Mmhmm PM Ive also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Um ID Mmhmm UI Next ME So y you are the secretary also PM Yes ME Right ME Okay PM Indeed PM Um PM Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting ME Perfectly yeah yeah of course uhhuh PM Um PM W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them PM Um we will see in which order we will handle them of PM Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager I try to work them out they were quite abstract and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it ID Mmhmm PM Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this the customers indeed yes ID Mm ME You mean the social target group who we wants to target ID Mm ME Oh the customers okay ID Yeah PM Think thats thats important matter ID Thats the big question yeah PM Uh PM So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting well uh well have a lunch PM Good PM Um PM Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ID No I dont PM You dont have presentation ID I wasnt ID No PM Uh you want a table to to uh Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um ID I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything ID Mmhmm ID Well Ive just been um presented with some research weve done in a small focus group so a hundred people just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control ID Um ID Its probably cant email this to you Ive just got a web page with some data on it ID Um basically its saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls ID Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly PM Mmhmm ID Um ID Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ID Um ID Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user ID Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot so they use their remote control quite frequently while theyre watching television ID Uh ID Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons so theyve got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that PM Mm ID Um PM Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ID I have an a web page yes PM Yes mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh ID Yep ID Yep sure PM Uh about this ID Mmhmm ID So basically um theres a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control ID Um power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour ID Um channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then theres things like channel settings audio settings which are only used very infrequently PM Mm ID Um ID Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used PM Mm ID Um ID An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users PM Yes yes I have that too ID Um ID Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control they want something thats easier to use straight away more intuitive perhaps PM Mm ID Um ME Its its easy to learn or how do you say its Okay too much time to learn ID Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one ID Yep ME Okay ID Um ME Not enough Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah its it okay its a webpage on the C its a file okay ID And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for RSI ID I dont know how wed go about combating that UI What do you mean there ID For RSI ID Respet Repetitive strain injury UI Okay PM Mm ID So ID But Mm PM They think that or do their doctor the doctor says PM But its its the opinion of the uh of the users huh ID Yeah ID Thats what the report says yeah PM So mm ID Um and then its got a demographic breakdown on Uh I should be able to actually if I email it to you now UI You can disconnect it there no PM You can maybe just just Hmm ID Oh no yeah ID Yeah ME O otherwise you yeah ID Um s hang on UI Then you can connect this one or this one yeah ME You can connect this one UI All to your computer ME Yeah ID Well ME So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um Yeah Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design UI Oh yeah ID Oh I need to muck around with this ID Its probably easier if you put it on yours and then Ill just email it to you ID Its just a web link UI Okay UI Hmm UI Yeah ID One thing it goes on to talk about which is interesting is the hang on a minute ME Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Yep ID Um one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control ME Speech recognition in Ah okay ID And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful PM D do you have numbers o o on that ID Yes Ill just get this up ME So that we dont Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech ID Well potentially yeah um I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well ME Okay ME Interesting idea ID You wanna have both options ME Okay PM Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesnt matter where it is my well its we should be in range or maybe it can respond and produce sound so say where it is ID Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Mm ME Yeah PM But the these are all quite fancy features Im not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents UI Well it would be f No you cant ME Yeah ID Yeah ME And we dont know where the state of the art of speech recognition is maybe you know UI Oh UI Well it depends you know like there is uh its a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on off one two twenty three yeah PM Mm ME But its quite noisy if there is the TV uh shouting ID Mm ID Yeah UI Its its going to be li its not going to be s so easy but u usually its going to be more of an isolated case but its but I dont know with twenty fi Okay its uh decline PM Yes that that that thats mm PM Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation ME Okay ID Um Well This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control who would pay more for it um ME So you had to to to summarise maybe the Mm ID Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more it goes down from there seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five PM Mm UI Okay ID Yeah PM Mmhmm ID But we sh Yeah it really depends where were gonna be targeting this product um which well be talking about later I think PM Decline with age mm PM Mm PM Yes PM We will talk about it later ID Did you get the email PM Okay ID Yep that one ME Mmhmm ID Just follow that link ME I thi You us yeah yeah ID Itll be in a different window yep ID Thats left that one ID Yep ME Okay perfect ME ID Mm ID So thats the figure that I was just talking about there with the different demographics UI Okay ID Another thing its talking about there is the LCD screen but theres no figures apparently on that PM Mm ME Mm kay PM Okay PM um Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ME Yeah ME Mm I okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair PM Oh this is Mmhmm y y you can move uh UI Now you can move I think yeah ME I okay PM Yes PM You can you can sa take my chair UI Its a channel selection a module this and this function go to the ID Sorry ID Oh UI Yeah ME So I think as everybody knows uh Im the uh Industrial Designer ME And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control ME Um Id like first to give a quick a very simple introduction how does it work so that everybody knows even if you dont have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important ID Mm ME So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed ID Mmhmm ME And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit the chip that can compose messages usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages alright ID Mmhmm ME So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product ME I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesnt work PM Mm ID Mmhmm ME So for that yeah as its important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design ID Mmhmm ME So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want ME Uh we want an on off button it can be uh its simple but its its important and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after right ID Mm ME So the components I quickly draw here is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so thats my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver ME This is very quick uh design uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you dont agree on it on that PM Mmhmm ME And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know ID Well PM Uhhuh ID You drew it a long time ago PM Is huh overwhelming ME And uh thats it so I wont go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components ID Ninety one PM No PM And and why do you want these kind of component ME So PM I mean are they cheap or are they uh reliable PM What were your Mm ME So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if its expensive but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah thats it for the working design uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh Yeah PM Yes PM It it its more clear now I think PM So Mmhmm UI But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma Well it to du its just you had to change the frequencies PM What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver I mean can you can you get back to it PM Yeah uh the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it ME Of course yeah PM So we we must adapt to the to the receiver PM I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh ME Yeah ME We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles PM Mmhmm PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm PM Yes PM Okay ME Um ME Okay PM Thank you ME The frequencies ME Yeah yeah UI Yeah ME Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah UI But you should be careful people are sometime becoming problem like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other TVs so basically through all the things ME That can control o other things ME Yeah PM Mm ID Ah UI So maybe we should think of yeah ME Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh Yes PM Yeah yes I I I I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things ID Thats handy ID So if the b TV in the next apartments really loud you can just turn it off UI Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyones TV and you can just walk away You dont have to be near the TV at all ID Yeah ID I like that idea PM Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew UI Yeah so PM I I I assume you were finished here PM Uh okay UI Okay UI So I can take I think mine now there ME Okay UI Okay so voila UI Hmm I can take mine its okay voila mm so mm UI Okay PM Oh PM I Uh sorry PM I know where it is UI Its on the desktop PM Its uh Yes UI Technical function UI Okay PM Its uh Mmhmm UI Like so UI Well UI So um Im going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually its about what is the user going to do I think my last presented what is going inside so whats the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it ID Mmhmm ID Yep UI So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the TV set as Mael has pointed and it will be decoded by the TV and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the TV and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver ME Mmhmm UI So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you dont need to k press the keys people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later UI But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone and it sends a message to the TV PM Mm ME Yep UI And um so generally mm I dont have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household actually so you have a standard TV remote where you have just a on off button and play uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option UI And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows but uh uh UI Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesnt have teletext option it can without any its a very simple thing um which which you can vouch UI And then you have uh whats the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market ID Mmhmm UI And then whi which is generally used by the people UI And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a TV and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the videos remote control and the TV they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with Yeah ID Okay ID How would that work ID So youve got say maybe a VCR and a TV which are separate so you on my one at home Ive got a VCR remote which then changes the channel on the VCR and doesnt do anything on the TV so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the TV or use the VCR UI Yeah ID or does it know which one you want to use UI Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still cant um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the VCR option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Mm UI In that case you want to browse faster browse slow you want to have those kind of functionalities ID Mm PM Mm mm mm mm mm ID Mm ME These are kind of next generation functionalities UI Its the next generation thing but it is going to come in couple of years PM Mm yes but I think its i i its already there I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I Ive seen them in the shop ID Mm UI Its goi Yeah its Yeah ID Mm UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Mm kay UI So its going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard TV thing ID Mm ID Yeah ID Thats fair enough ID Mm ID But I dont think were trying to make a universal remote here UI No no we are not making a universal remote we are just looking at uh giving a scenario I have a TV and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh its going to do that job for me ID Thats yeah ID Mm ID Mm ID Because y Mmhmm PM W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this PM Mean you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes ID Mm ID Mm ID Yep UI Yeah UI So Okay so that p ends my presentation PM But its good to keep in mind ID Mm PM Mm PM Very well UI Well UI So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand video overdemand or what we call it as its presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies and then you select those list ME Mmhmm ID Mm ID Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Yeah UI And it basically you go off it downloads the movie it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your TV ME Yeah ID Mm UI And thi this is going to come PM Good ME Or even you dont need to download it its streamed uh online uh yeah UI Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and Yeah so ME Yeah ME Yeah ID Mm PM Um so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Um first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but its its getting used less and less ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Thats thats especially because of the internet of course ID Hmm PM So we should think about it um PM Do we include it and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself ID Mm PM Uh as uh a in any case its its not used well very much but its it is still used ID Mm UI Um PM Um further yes we must think uh do we stay uh to to television only the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you cant go back uh huh or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices PM Uh indeed indeed ID So DVDs and VCRs ID Mm PM And and and the hard disk recorders PM Um furthermore uh w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Fourteen or for O okay ME So Mmhmm PM So thats to thats I mean theres a market but uh they will grow older older and youll al always need to have the the future with younger people ID Mmhmm PM Um therefore younger people like trendy trendy designs so thats w we should make our our our RC as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all PM Hmm ID Mm UI Yeah its uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys you know right now if you take it you have like zero one two three like a keys separately but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top it takes one number you press on the bottom it takes another number and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you dont see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh Yeah so ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Mm PM Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh Hmm ID Mm ID But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting especially if were going after a younger market thats the the the mm the new and the funky things thats yeah theres lot theres lots of pretty mobile phones not too many pretty remote controls ME Yeah PM Yes yes mo Yes its recognisable Mm mm ME Because they are already used to that you know product ME Yeah ID Thats Mm PM And and they are skilled uh by using it UI So for example uh Well uh Okay it works ME Mmhmm ME UI Fine UI So for example you have uh presently uh keys like one two three like this actually and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Forty minutes PM Mael can you hand me over this uh ME Yes PM Uh thank you ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way PM Mm well I think fi five min Mmhmm ID Cause we havent talked about demographic at all and its a very important issue UI Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so UI too sorry so we basically dont change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious they dont look uh so there there is a very sligh thing so if you press on the top it takes the one it takes the three uh four sorry four here uh five and six so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you dont have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Mm ME Mmhmm ID Mm PM Okay PM Kay I I think now that the ideas clear ME Yep ID Mm PM Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group ID Yeah ID Which I think is quite tricky UI Yeah ID Um basically were trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldnt they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one PM Of course they have already one PM So our our our remote control has to be better ID But its not going to have more functionality cause its only a low market its a cheapend remote control we cant beat modern functionality we might well be able to beat them on th the look of it th the design of it but thats not a big seller if theyre not just going to buy a new remote control just cause it looks pretty they have to actually need it as well UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID So Im not sure how we can get people to buy this thing PM Mm PM I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh RC is is important when they are buying one but Indeed ID Mm ID Yeah ID But why are they buying one in the first place PM So that will be about functionality Mm ID Mm ID But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality theyll buy a universal remote ID Ive got friends whove got so many things they need a universal remote otherwise theyre using five different remotes for their all their things PM Mmhmm PM Mm ID In that case they wouldnt buy our product because it doesnt give them what they need in terms of functionality PM So your you think we should go for a more u universal highperformance What do What do you think about What componen I dont know ID Well we cant with the price range ID We Were not building a universal remote were not building a high end product ME Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R s RC and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features ID Mm ID Mmhmm ID Mm ME Yeah ME And um But yeah thats Ye I dont think LCD is not necessary well th for long term ID But yeah ID If were getting into universal remote territory were getting to LCD screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot PM I dont know whether thats necessary PM Is the LCD screen I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive ID For universal remotes If you mm ID And quite complicated to use yes PM S so we can try to go in between and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh RC because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal ID Mmhmm ID Not as flexible maybe yeah but s yeah ME Yeah ME Universal ME Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID But if were going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own TVs to use a remote control on PM Mm yes but w were targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group ID Okay ID So theyre yeah PM People yes PM Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Yep ID I dont know really what the the price range for remote controls is ID Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range or are we kind of middle to bottom ID I dont know PM Uh well I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money ME Mm ID Mm ID Mmhmm ME Yeah PM So d Do you agree UI Well Well I its fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive ME Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap UI Uh and it d uh Our provin Mm ID Mm ME So Im okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh RC yeah PM Mmhmm PM You think its possible for the twelve Euro fifty ME Yeah PM Okay PM Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control UI Uh yeah thats thats what we needed basically ID Mmhmm PM Mm PM Mm PM Okay UI Uh thats needed right now UI And uh basically you can look to the standards of other Actu Yeah ME Yeah thats needed yeah ID Mm ME And if we want to get the market we really need that ID Yeah ID Yeah ID So I guess what Id like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices being able to switch between them there may be stereo VCR and TV ME Yes ME Exactly ID And just be able to s use them all from the same remote but not at the same time PM Yes UI Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them ME Is that okay for you ME Yeah PM Mm mm mm mm ME Yeah ME Yeah PM So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market ME Yes ID Mm UI Okay UI Okay ID Mmhmm yep UI Voila UI Hmm PM So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no UI So UI Well UI Oh I dont have anything right now UI We can well well go and well Im sure well up something good for the Yeah so we meet in well what are our Okay ME Oh thats thats fine then PM Okay ID Mmhmm PM W yes we uh we can have lunch now ME Yeah ID Mmhmm PM So um Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting PM But you will be informed via the computer PM Okay UI Cool ME Okay perfect UI So see you later,"The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. The marketing expert explains the research she read about, which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. The Industrial Designer presents, explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. The Interface Designer gives his presentation, talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. Standard TV remotes have an on/off button, play, volume change, number keypad, and a 1 or 2 digit option. He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. The project manager recieves a message from account manager, which he shares with the group. They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo, VCR, and TV. They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting."
ID Right first time this time ID Nu There we go ID Its not that complicated but I get it wrong every time ME Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew ID For Matthew yep PM Mm PM Uh So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh hes uh obviously late for some reason ID Mmhmm ME Mm kay PM Good PM Um PM Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design PM I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design ID Mmhmm PM Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh PM Uh I will take some minutes uh again ID Mmhmm PM Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented ID Yep ME Yep PM So and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ID I have a presentation Im just making this Okay Ill just email you this file my presentation ME Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is its important that Matthew yeah is here because its really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but its okay its good PM Okay PM Ah there is Matthew UI Sorry PM So PM Good PM Do presentation ready ID Mmhmm Im just emailing it to you PM Oh okay UI So Yeah I sent you the slides you didnt see them PM So did you manage uh Oh yes I see him good yes UI Okay PM No UI So Kay ID Okay it shouldve gone through to you PM Okay mm yes I have it ID Mmhmm ID Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that were gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment ID Um can I just put this on ID So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it ID Um ID This is to do this I will not remove my microphone ID We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time the main results of that and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that weve already discussed really ID The most important by far was the look and feel of it ID It needs to be something thats very different from everything else out there ID It needs to stand out ID It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment ID Most people find remote controls boring at the moment we need to have something that looks interesting that looks exciting that will stand out ID People will wanna buy it ID Um That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else apart from just the look of it ID People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want ID Thats a really cool feature and it has to make them wanna buy it again ID Third on the list and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect it has to be easy to use ID So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um ID Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment uh fruit and vegetables um ID This is basically talking about just the the feel of it so probably not the smell of it but the bright colours um eyecatching really bold designs and a spongy feel PM Mm ME Mmhmm PM Mm ID Um I had a talk to the design people about this but having a remote thats tactile that feels different that would be really cool ID That would make it stand out PM Hmm ID Um ME So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said PM Spongy feel ME Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo Okay ID Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing UI You can Yeah ID Spongy is the current texture but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something thatll be something that sets it apart rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment PM Mm ME Yeah PM Okay ID So as far as the design goes the very most important aspect was the design to the customers ID So going with the fruit and vegetable idea weve got the bright colours so makes it stand out the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours part of the fruit and vegetables um ID Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones theyve all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers so they can choose what colour the outside is ID Thats one way of looking at it um ID Textured feel we just talked about ID Maybe its another way of doing that PM Mmhmm ID So if its part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture a spongy one or a soft one or something like that ID So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room or just what they like their sports team or whatever ME Yeah thats a very good idea yeah ME Yeah ID Um and yeah still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality the way the mobile phones work the way the keypad looks ID Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment ID Theyre big selling items ID People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that and we can start using some of their ideas ID Um back to technological in in innovation not quite as important but still a big issue ID Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if its been lost uh thats one thing we could look at ID There are other aspects like LCD screens and speech recognition which werent I dont think in my personal opinion gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them ME Mmhmm ID I think were better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in ID And use ID I had no real specific ideas for this maybe we just the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe by themselves and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you dont use as much either hidden away or completely separate PM Mm PM Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the Mm UI Voila ID Yep and thats the presentation PM Okay good thats very clear ME Yeah very clear UI Yeah PM Kay PM Um ID So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that PM Uh Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh Ive it was a good idea maybe to to Yes the the the there are changeable covers but on the other hand I I dont know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational Hmm ID I think you Hmm ME To let the people choose you mean ME Yeah ID Well were selling so many units of this ID This is gonna be a mass marketed product we can afford to have two or three different designs at least PM Mmhmm ME Yeah a range of uh yeah a set of three four different aspects PM Yes ID Mm mm PM Mmhmm ME Sure that fits the Yeah PM Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh aftersales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three five Euro ID Mm ID Mm PM Thats a very good idea um And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthews presentation because the Together indeed uh because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use what you were already mentioning UI Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together ID Mmhmm ID Mm ME Yeah yeah I agree UI It should be easier with that UI Yeah ID Mmhmm yeah ME Yeah ME And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside UI So Yeah UI Yeah so Ill Ill go with that actually so um Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures different forms and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button ID Mmhmm UI So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do ME Yeah ID Mmhmm UI So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the TV VCR music system operated ones actually and they are very specific to each other but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the VCR and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information names like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality say TV VCR or something I say it to the TV and the TV and you can programme the keys if you want to certain keys are even the channel information ID Mm ID Mm ID Mm ID I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like BBC rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad UI Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly even if you arrange it by however you arrange it you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to So it it its like it limited one ID Thats a good idea ID Mm ME Yeah ID Hmm ID Mm ID Yeah I really like that idea ME So what functionalities do you suggest for that ME For facing this problem UI In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing eighty word which shouldnt be th that difficult to implement like eighty to hundred word ID Mmhmm UI Basically you want you dont want to store all the channels in the remote control you want to st store your favourite channel ID Mm ID Maybe ten channels yeah at the most UI Yeah some ten twelve channel information UI You know you dont want to st store all the hundred channel information into that ME Okay ID Mm UI And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with LCD display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you dont know really which functionality is now so I am using the TV so every time I use it it could be like for example I can use a simple toggle switch and a display so I press it so the display says okay Im in TV or DVD or whatever it is instead of having three keys separately for four keys to model the functionalities will increase actually and for you and you might want you dont want separate keys for all of them ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Oh yeah yeah yeah mm ID Mm ME Mm ID Mm UI You cant UI And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them and you can operate them ME Mmhmm UI So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present UI I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote is uh um is a good idea like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition ID Mmhmm UI I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine and so if you say hello coffee machine it say hi Joe or something like that you know and uh Yeah you you wont be using it so its a limited vocabulary mm thing and very isolated word and its uh it is interesting and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing like uh it could indicate youre uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote the blinking ID Mm b But a coffee machine theres not too many words theyd be using with that its a its a small vocabulary ID Mm ID Mm ID Mm ID Mm ME Yeah UI At the same time if its a dark room it can be used to locate the remote also or Yeah you can let them to do that ME And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys ID Two thirty five supposed to finish ME Some of them ME And uh isnt that too difficult for the we want w I dont know if we still want the um RC to be easy to use thats the compromise ID Hmm UI N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put ME Yeah ID Hmm UI Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint ID Mm ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Mm ME Yeah ID I think you can do it both ways UI So it de So So Yeah ID You can have it so its easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features ME A standard ME Yeah PM Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I Im not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents ME Yeah PM Im sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity but its its its the real We have to consider it ID Hmm ID Hmm ID Hmm PM S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition I mean maybe its possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the Mm ME Yeah ID Mm ID Hmm ME Mmhmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys you said uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros but for the ASR system uh Im not sure if its feasible to have this or We Exactly yeah i if if its a low vocabulary its already implemented and w how much its cost maybe with a f cheap chip UI Yeah UI We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah ID Mm UI Maybe we can come we we can talk to them and we can come with that you know PM Mm mm ME Yeah UI And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display you might need the to che keep checking the battery so you really need a some kind of indicator so it could be a blinking option of LED it could actually be used to detect also ID Hmm PM Hmm ME Yeah UI If its in a dark room you can basically detect it also ID Mm ID Hmm ME Yeah PM Hmm UI So No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um it can be for two purposes like if you have an LCD display and all those things its not going to be the standard remote which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of DC PM Mm ID I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something ID Mm ID Mm ID Hmm ID Mm UI It may need more actually so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that some functionality to indicate the battery limit ME Mm ID Hmm ME Its true UI And then if the battery limit is indicated if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to ID Mm ME Mmhmm UI You know PM Kay good UI Yeah so You you have time some more ME I dont know how if if I have time to talk about the Okay PM Mm yes um I would Yes yes you can you can still UI Yep PM We have time UI Sure you can you know ME So what Im gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a RC a remote control and how is it manufactured h what is the process just to explain you ID Mmhmm ME So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end ME So there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control PM Nice UI Hmm ME Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver ME And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons infrared led etcetera for the components um ME So you finding just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed and then it translate to the key to a sequence something like morse code as you know uh with a different sequence for each key and uh uh thats with the components we will use we will have different uh messages different sequences and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because its easier to mass produce and assemble ME And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V VLSI or FPGA uh high technology and this is important and also well use uh yeah like in any uh hightech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them UI Yeah mm mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use ME If its plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit veg or I dunno ID Mm PM Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but with the changeable covers to fancy it up ME Yes ME Yes ID Mmhmm PM So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in for instance a wooden case ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Yes PM I mean just what Mmhmm ID Mm just have a yeah Just the veneer on it yeah ME Yeah like they do in with cars I think ME Yeah inside the car yeah ME So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons a scroll wheels integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse UI Yeah ME And uh very cheap LCDs so liquid crystal displays so Im wondering I think we might be able to integrate LCD into our RC ME And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do ID Hmm ME So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher hightech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright ME And the display requires an advanced chip which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if its uh uh made for mm four million uh items then I think w we could be able to handle that ME So to to sum up um we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account ME And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then its better to to to maybe see that with uh the the UR exp URI Expert so that we can its really a teamworking uh UI Sorry ID Mm PM Mm ME So I I cannot design something without your agreement right UI Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the LCD display over there or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things youll need inside your thin inside W wh what W what Okay PM No of course ME Yes ME Yeah its kind of um simple pro progra programmable device and we have to insert ME I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of Exactly yeah for customizing and yeah UI Okay UI Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card UI Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually ME Okay UI How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things ME Yeah PM So So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this ME Yeah good idea ME Yeah PM Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip so can we use same chip so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features ME Exactly yeah thats a very good idea we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle uh its called FPGA chip that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh LCD and yeah PM Yes PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip ME Yes UI D well Well I dont know if itll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know PM Do you think thats feasible PM Uh You th you think its possible UI Is it possible to fit in to that ME Yeah also thinking I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros it will be okay but uh UI Sorry PM Hmm ID Well maybe we need specific costings then ID Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better ME Yeah thats an excellent idea PM Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price ME Yeah yeah PM That w that would be a very good idea ID Mm ME Yeah because right now I dont have price in in head but for next meeting Im sure yeah be able to do that PM Mm PM Good good UI Yeah thats uh thats something which I wanted to ask you also like what will be the each individually the cost of it ME Yeah UI For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldnt suggest for wood uh cause its I think its m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood ME Okay ME I agree on that ID Mm ME Yeah UI It will be much ch much expensive th though its the most natural thing but Yeah PM Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price ID Hmm UI Yeah its uh Yeah we we can give a preference to them but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is its much better with that rather than going for Yeah PM Do do you agree ME Yeah but i its a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user and maybe with uh graphs or I dont know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that ID Mm yeah sure UI Yeah PM Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design ME Yeah UI Yea Okay ID Mmhmm PM Uh so drawing it on the board ME Perfect yeah PM And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh PM So um Let lets say next meeting w you produce two designs one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price UI Yeah sure UI Yeah we will uh Yeah ME Yeah ID Mm PM Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh how do you call them these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it UI Uh ID Mm UI Yeah PM But that that that that can be done later ME Yeah customized PM We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control ID Mm PM Um UI Okay UI We can give them smooth keys you know UI Smooth keys with bigger s uh So that you know The the problem most of the time weve seen the keys is that its small and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys then you can merge them together to Oh you can actually for example if you see they are they are they are quite small over here and uh now you can for example as I was if you make them big it may change the look of the thing also to the people ME Yeah PM Mm ID So is there any of these that youre looking at particularly or is this just ideas ID Mmhmm ID Hmm ID Mm UI At the same time it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this RSI and all problem ID Mm PM Mmhmm ID Mm yeah PM Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think UI Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh Yeah ID You see ME I agree yeah and not too m too many keys of course yeah ID Yeah PM No no ID Mm well one Ive had before a r r remote control we have at home is one thats actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just covers half the keys most of the time and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys PM Mm mm mm PM Mm w but then you have still have uh when you dont use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you dont use UI Yeah ID Mm PM So maybe its possible uh I dont know whether you can can indicate this that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you dont use that much ME Yeah ID Mm ID Yeah ID Um yeah Ive seen that before too UI Yeah ID Anoth another like b it flips up and then youve got another layer of buttons underneath PM Yes UI Yes UI Yeah so its something like this the model here s you can put the keys Yeah ID Mm ME Mm ID But Ive seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well ME Thats what you mean PM Yes I I th thats what I mean so I mean something like like a book UI Yeah ID I like this one ID I like the shape of this one UI Yeah ID Can we have can we think about maybe having a a nonrecta non nonrectangular one so with not just the straight little box thats a maybe curved or something ME Yeah I like also this one ME Yeah the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or Okay UI Yeah mm ID Mm mm kay UI We should make a Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be Yeah that would depend upon us actually ID Is this for the next meeting though ID I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting PM Mm PM Ju just make two designs and the we we can decide decide between th those designs ME Yeah yeah yeah ID Yep UI Yeah okay PM I think that would be a good idea ME Perfect PM So anyone uh any questions for now UI No no ID No UI I dont have ID So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting PM Um yes I come to that uh uh Yes well m maybe uh I dont know whether thats possible maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow UI Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices if youre using speech recognition or something like that ID Mm ID Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things PM I dont know whether thats possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible ID Mm ID Okay PM So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email ID Yep ME Exactly UI Mm ME Yeah ME Two or three prototypes UI Two PM Two ME Two UI One for like cost and the one with like higherend so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them yeah thats how it is PM I Mm and then Hmm ME Okay ID Mm ME Yeah and find maybe a compromise ID Hmm PM Yes okay ME Perfect yeah ID Mmhmm UI Yep PM Okay lets call this to an end ID Mm kay UI Okay ID Thanks guys ME Thanks UI So we are done for now,"Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive. She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate. She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens. The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms. He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting."
ID Did you get my email with the slides ID Ah ID Tricky UI I guess I have to change the pen otherwise UI Will be completely different ID Dunno ID Maybe theyre supposed the pens supposed to go over the seats ID Might be seat floor rather than person ID Yeah put it back UI Yeah UI And do you think its ID Yep ID Yeah ID Jos making faces at me PM Okay UI Yeah PM So PM Matthew is uh late again ID Mmhmm PM Probably an important man PM Um PM So well it is important for him to be here uh UI Yeah UI So what can you PM He he he You did work together didnt you UI Yeah we will yeah so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer PM Yes UI I think we can put on the here PM Yes PM Yes UI Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items PM Mm PM Um yes but w we Yes maybe we should phone him UI Um can we have a phone can someone its really w well designed PM Um well Um when he is not here we will just we just have to continue ID Mm ID Mm object tracking PM Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again UI Yeah ID Okay PM And um well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents UI Kay PM Its uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in its good when you dont stay in you have to redesign PM There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter PM So we have to consider that UI Yep PM Good PM Um so maybe Anna you can have your presentation ID Well we cant no we cant do evaluation til we have a design PM Okay Matthew PM Nice uh you are here UI Great PM Great PM Great PM Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs UI Yep UI So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually right seven eight Euros and uh well first for both they have um a special shape maybe the designer can uh explain better than me but uh its like a surf board ID Mmhmm UI And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf TV maybe the web and uh its kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff ID Mm kay ME Or browse UI And also its not too far from um a mobile PM Mm ID Mmhmm UI So people are used to that kind of shape right ME Mm ID Mmhmm UI Dont take care too much about the colour because w yeah we dont take yeah ME Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now UI So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah LA LA LED the onoff button in red PM Eye ID Mmhmm ME I yeah ME LED ID Mmhmm UI Here would be the volume ID Oh yeah UI On the on the left okay so easy to turn on t and off PM Uhhuh ME Mmhmm hmm PM Yes UI And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew ME Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels actually so you can go up and down the channels uh if you have a video or something you can forward back ID Mmhmm ID Yeah UI How can you change from VCR to uh TV by the way ME Oh no no no this is a single this this is a model with just the TV one UI Okay yeah ME No no just sorry this is a standard TV one we are not talking about that UI Yeah yeah PM Ah okay ME So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits ID Mmhmm ME The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel ME And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ID Okay so its its t a very basic remote then its only Mm ME Actually ME Its a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market actually thats what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Mm ID Mm UI Seven eight ei eight Euros PM Exce except for the for the special shape the surfing board it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh ME Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah ME So this one model and uh yeah ID Can I see ID Thanks ME Sure ID Okay I like the volume control thats good ME Th this is a magic one but I know we dont want to talk about that you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic its like uh its like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future it can come ID Uhhuh UI Yeah ID So it doesnt actually have buttons ME So that uh then what we look t yeah ID Did you wanna see PM Mmhmm PM Yeah no you can carry on I just look how it feels all ME This is a model yeah PM Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone ID Mm UI Yeah ME Yep PM Just Im I really want to talk to it UI Yeah actually yeah PM But ID It wont talk back PM So but but continue with your uh mmhmm ME Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality uh in this way so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys but dont worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here ID Right PM Mm ME And so they have more space actually and uh its easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye and then you have a power button which l volume what you have and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop and uh then uh you can uh you have a LCD display here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like its a toggle switch which could change the function say y you press it Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm UI Play pause PM Mmhmm PM From DVD player to television or something UI Exactly yeah ME I really can change it so Instead of having many switches y The LCD can display what is that on that and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here or in the button th here so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display PM Yes UI To audio and to video on demand PM Mm ID Mmhmm PM Yes and and and then you get feedback via the LCD yeah UI Yes PM Mmhmm UI This is the orange button the microphone PM Mmhmm UI An yeah ME And here is a small LED which is like blinking one which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay PM Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ME And uh well then we have a cover basically basically you dont need much of the time this when you need you can use it and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover you know UI Yeah PM Mm UI Crazy dis designer okay ME Design enter PM Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed will it also uh cover up the LCD screen ME Yeah UI Yeah yeah yeah yeah ME Yeah ME Its basically to do that UI Yeah PM But but the LCD screen I mean is a very uh well an eyeattracting feature which shouldnt be shouldnt be That th thats true ME Actually when you are watching the TV when you are watching anything or listening to them you hardly care about what is getting displayed here you know uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the LCD actually giving a cover to that actually UI Oh actually well PM Mm ME Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec its more robust that way PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm PM Yes PM Yes more robust PM Yes okay ID Mm ME Uh yeah ME And you have very good chances Yeah UI Its low weight UI You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight PM Mmhmm ME Yeah UI So the the cost is actually a bit more its uh its its sixteen Francs ME It Sixteen Euros UI Sixteen Euros sorry PM Okay ID So its well outside the budget then UI Then its out of budget UI But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer PM But w Mm kay UI And they say basically that the SR system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry ME Yeah ME Three Euros UI And um No no no part of that yeah ID Thats on top of the sixteen or is it part of that ME Part of that ID So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition UI Yeah yeah ME Yeah PM Hmm ID Mmhmm ME Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything PM Mmhmm UI Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then its too Locati ID Mm PM Mmhmm ID Whats this one on the side ME Ah thats for the its kind of a LED for indicating your battery and as well as its like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside UI Location ID Ah okay ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Mm kay ID I like the shape of them I do like the the size and the the shape ME Yeah PM Well well Mm PM Be before ta talking about the money and whats possible and what is not possible maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um Yes ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products both of these two PM Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria so what what is important to look at ID Okay ID Basically this is what weve talked about already um from the marketing point of view PM Mmhmm ID We just wanna make sure that weve taken into account Yep PM Well just do it quickly if if we al already ID So its just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that weve identified as being important to selling the product PM Mmhmm ID Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end well make an evaluation based on that so just average the score of those items so These are the things we identified as being important ID Um the three things were look and feel innovation and ease of use were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic PM Mmhmm ID And then goin following the company motto following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well ID So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them PM Um n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now Mm well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it ID Okay ID So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess ID Not sure how this is gonna come out ID So the first one was really very far below budget would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ID Cause if were only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a Mmhmm PM And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro ID Mmhmm ID Yep UI Mmhmm ID Mmhmm UI Functionality ID Okay so look and feel innovation Mmhmm ME And now it easy to use UI Easy to use PM Mm UI target ID And trends ID Oh you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ID Is that part of both of them or PM Um well w w we can still discuss that ID Okay PM So um and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive but um Ive received uh a framework which we can do this ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ID Mmhmm UI No ME No PM No okay this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh ID No ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM So maybe we can start with this uh calling this one ID Okay ID Yep ID So its the pink PM Th th this is the first design ID And the other ones green PM Yes ID Okay so look and feel ID Where um one is Ive broken the pen again PM Uh there is another pen ID S yeah ID Get that one ID Um w ones bad and sevens the best ID Sorry ones true and sevens false ID Ones the best PM Okay ID So on a scale of one to seven PM Kay PM Okay PM So PM Look and feel PM Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think PM In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good is very good in your hand so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm yeah ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM But thats just half we should also consider look and then i it looks quite conventional ID Mmhmm ID Mm PM Dont you agree ME Mm yeah ID On the scale u its between functional and fancy basically were looking at so Mmhmm PM So maybe two PM Hmm PM Hmm PM Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five I Its my opinion but I dont know what what Four four ME Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed its like the surf as you say you know UI Yeah ME It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know UI Yeah UI Four maybe ID Four ME Four yeah that Yeah ID Okay PM Now we th th then we settle on four ID Mmhmm ME I will gi yeah UI Uh PM Kay PM Can you maybe fix the other Mm try it just try it UI Yeah ID Mm UI If you press like this not like this then you But Okay ID No thats the inks dried ME No ME C can you get the batteries ME No no the battery has fallen down thats i Yeah ID Batterys low isnt it the ink ID The b thats the that that one ID battery there ME No no its not that its how to close a battery ME Okay ME Now it should be ID Mm ID No I think its lost a battery ID No its It would still write but it wouldnt pick it up with the sensors PM Oh it will not ri mm mm ME Is there another battery there ME Oh yeah ID You got a second UI Try a Perfect ID Well we wont be able to tell PM Yes it it has a mm ID Is that working ID Did it come out ID Good ID Okay PM Good PM Good ID Because well be able to see it still even if it wasnt working its just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldnt be picked up on the the actual whiteboard UI Yeah yeah UI Yep PM Okay PM So then then Ah ID And the other one UI Wow ID I think its slightly better um its hard to tell from just the plasticine but Mm PM Mm PM I I I When we want to include I I Im doubting about this this component PM It it it it breaks in your Mm yes I see mm okay UI Kay maybe Its not a button its a led its a Ac actually yeah it should be embedded ME No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually it its n i it is jus Its a led actually which which ll be covering in a curve Its will be embedded there so it wont be really you know protruding or something ID Mm ID Okay ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Yeah UI Oh you can push push it again you can push it ID Yeah ID The other thing is is the left hand one protruding ME Yeah ID Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand maybe it wont work so well ME Yeah ME Yeah ME No you it it not protruding actually it will go in better into that Uh its fine I think ID Okay PM Well r r Mm ID Id say two or three for that one personally ID Probably more towards three than two PM I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse PM So so I would also say this is four ID Okay PM But w w do you what do you think ME My just that um the feel is that um you right now you you dont see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this now its embedded one UI Yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM Yes ME This is how embedded one will Yeah PM Yes it basically is the same shape ME Its a bas basically the same thing actually PM Mmhmm ME You will be Except that in this c Yeah PM Mm UI And the LCD makes it better UI Yeah ME And you might have a slight thing for to forward and Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Mm okay PM Yeah UI So I will say two ID Yeah its d its definitely more fancier than that one PM Yes okay UI I would say two three ID Okay ME Yeah ID So consensus ID Two or three PM Two PM Mm ID Two UI Yep PM Twos good yes ME looking like No but except for the design of the surf ID Um kay ID Innovation ID The first one not really muc Mm UI Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market right ID Yeah ID Do we Mm UI Yeah UI The surf uh design PM Mm ID What What features are we actually including ME You should be rea Uh no I think its more of the feel ID Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ID Theres nothing like that ID But th is there any theres no actual innovation in that at all its just a straightout remote control ME Yeah yeah ME Yeah PM Mmhmm UI Yeah PM Mmhmm ID Okay PM The only innova innovation is the shape UI Yeah ME Say about that ID Okay PM S so that Mm ID So theres no this uh look and feel thing though thats not a technological innovation UI Yeah ME Yeah UI Youre right ID So Id be up for seven for innovation UI Yeah UI And the And the second one is really uh state of the art uh in terms of innovation ME Yep UI And um with many more functionalities and can open and close the the bottom part ME Yeah it gives it Yep PM Yes PM A and the LCD screen is Thats thats thats well its quite innovative UI Yeah UI And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this PM Mm UI Uh could put it at one or two I would say ID Okay PM Yeah UI Personally PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm ID So what is it what are the innovations with this ID Got the LCD screen UI Uh Yeah automatic speech recognition ID Is that in this one though ID Is this cause this is the Th th there were different options we discussed then we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget ME No we ha Yeah eight Euros yeah PM We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget ID Okay UI Yeah ID So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one UI So Eight ID Eight Euros PM Eight UI Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah ID And this one was sixteen Euros PM Yes UI Sixteen ME Sixteen Euros ID Okay ID So ID Innovation for this one is two ID One ME Its a two I would say two ID Two UI W W un to be one what would do we nee actually yeah I dont see okay one would would be without buttons PM Two PM Why it is one PM A man w w Yes ID Mm ME Yeah ID Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it so Give it a one UI Bu Yeah UI So maybe we can put one PM This this is it w with the speech recognition UI Its using speech recognition yeah ME Okay yeah PM Well PM Gi given that that it works then its I think one UI Yeah one yeah ID Yep ID Okay ID Ease of use ME Uh He is used to it act They are used to it actually UI So the first one is really standard so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it right ID Mm ID Yeah PM Mm ID Yep ID So thats maybe a a two for ease of use UI Yeah ME Here there may Uh though it has more functionality I think it shouldnt be for the user to learn it actually UI Um the other one is quite easy tho though ID Okay PM Hmm ME It shouldnt be diffi Uh yeah actually in fact I think it will be Yeah Yeah but y Well we have reduced the keys actually you see ID So maybe a three or a four UI One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons ID Mm UI And there is a like I would say three UI Or maybe four ID Okay ID Consensus ID Three or four PM Three I would ME Three is fine with me UI Yeah yeah because its n uh its not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so This one would be uh for grandmothers ID Three PM Three ID Okay ME Yeah its a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually its not so easy like this one the normal PM No ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Yes but then when when he is used to it i i it is quite easy ME Is quite easy yeah PM So so I think th three is good ME Initially there there is a lot of effort yeah PM Yeah ID Okay PM Good PM Whats the next ID So threes uh how well it goes to the target demographic ME Mm ID So were d were still thinking twenty to forty year olds PM So Twe twenty to forty yes thats Mmhmm ID Thats Mm ME Oh no this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually UI No UI Yeah grandmothers yeah ME Yeah ID So sh completely changed our demographic there its not part of the the funky young thing ME And Oh yeah PM Well exce except for the surfing shape UI Yeah thats true PM I mean thats thats something which which has an appeal on this group I think but Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm UI Yeah ID Yeah ID If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah UI Yeah ID Thats its still Ye Mm ID Cause we have got room weve got some budget there to add a few things to it thats right PM But as it is now I w would say mm six something UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Do you agree ID And Mm ME I Well I think Yeah UI Yeah because its so important its i it was written that it really so important the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets the right range of people right ME Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market its going to be cheap actually UI Yeah UI But w Yeah ID But its going to be cheap whatever though it was set with i weve got a set price ME So And people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a Okay UI But for us its yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros PM Mm yeah indeed ID Yeah ID Theres nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one PM Th t t Ju just think twenty five Euros I mean its not going to be cheaper UI Yeah ME Okay ME So in that case well its fine then UI Yeah ME We can yeah PM Mm ID Okay PM Mm PM Okay ID Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ME And the demographics of Yeah I think its uh it has more market actually ID Its got the got the the toys in it its got the LCD screen and Mm PM Yeah tha tha tha tha tha thats I think its better because of the LCD screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the Mm ID Yeah UI Yeah UI And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this I think for this audience we need absolutely the LCD screen ID Mmhmm PM So the LCD screen uh attracts yes ID Yeah PM Because it Mm ma maybe thats something to consider yes so ID I think especially if were gonna n have an LCD screen on a low range product then thats good UI Yeah ID Mm ID Okay PM Wh what what No s say t two ID Id probably go with three again for that one UI Or even Even one and two ID Mmhmm ME Y yeah you know two UI Or two ID Okay ID So two yeah PM Two UI Yeah UI Two yeah ME Yeah two yeah ME Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that ID Mmhmm ME Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to We have to practically test it ID Yeah ID Yep ID And especially I guess cause this has the speech recognition as well and that makes it more appealing its more of a a new fun toy ME The field test will tell you how good ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Okay PM Okay the final point trends ID And following the trends ME The trends ID So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel PM Mm PM Mm ID So as it is not really doing either of them PM I think Mm UI Spongy uh that means that it goes in in the water ME Mmhmm ID Well the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but Im thinking one of the Nokias thats got like you ca it hasnt got individual buttons its got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy UI Uh okay ME Yeah I know UI But this one includes this feature right UI Spongy buttons ME Yeah ME We we we we we yeah its the way they are going to be actually ID So its sort of yeah ID Mm UI So Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie ID Okay PM Mm ID But thats if youre using the covers PM And the then we can al yes UI Yeah ID Or is it just one Well they make it for mobiles it cant be that much more complicated PM We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think to to make a cover for s such a phone PM I mean Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh I th I th I think O o or just two things which can be put on each other ME But why do you want to cover that actually ME In that uh w in the mod Uh uh y are you sure ID So you got the option of having different colours or different textures UI Yeah UI This is possible ME Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone yeah ID Mm UI Yeah exactly like Nokia phones ID Mm PM Yes exactly like it ME Yep PM Uh so Maybe we can but we have to decide it we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features ID Mmhmm ID I think the if we do the cover thats really going with the companys philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out youll still be able to put a new cover on it and then itll still be in fashion PM Mm PM Mm mm mm mm mm UI Yeah UI Cause sometimes look at this computer th this laptop its all black and uh its quite conventional and sometimes people dont like too much flashy colours like this one presented here ID Mm ID Mm ID Mm UI So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one very standard one that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things ID Mm ID Yep PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Yep ID Mm PM Mm PM Mm ID And then you have the option of having the different colours different covers PM Yes PM So so so that that would make the trends equal so we we we really have dont have I mean Mm UI Yeah ID Mm ID Theres n yeah ID Cause thats the thats the feature that could be included in either of them ID Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one UI Yeah so a a point better for the for the number two PM Yes indeed ID Okay ID So ID Two and three or one and two PM Yes ME Yeah its one PM Say say one and two PM One and two ID Mmhmm UI Okay PM So le le lets see PM So d this one has spongy but buttons ID Okay ME Yeah it says a One point six one point One point eight yeah UI Yeah the blue one uh spongy PM Mm I see yes okay ID Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five so five mm nine by five one point s eight PM Good PM Just add it UI Nine PM You know PM Three six seven ID This one eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one divided by five is four point two yep ME Four point Uh four point two UI Very good ID Okay ID But we still got a very different price for those two so theyre not really comparable yet anyway PM Mmhmm PM We we must try to get them closer UI Yeah its right yeah thats right ID Yep PM Both in i i or we just have to choose ME Wow PM And adapt PM Because when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap ID Yep ID Mmhmm ID Well its easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out ID Thatll basically take us down to the budget PM Yes well But Im now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here UI So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros PM Mm UI Uh unfortunately we didnt see this chip uh Matthew so maybe we have to recap with this one ME Yeah ME Yep PM Mm tha Well yes well uh re reconsider it ME Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this yeah PM So lets lets try to to model this this phone in this sheet uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didnt speak about that ME Mmhmm PM Its a its a normal battery or Yes ME Yeah it migh It itll need uh more than a conventional one it wont be uh just maybe you might use a AA battery actually ME What do you say Mael UI For this one its a normal battery PM Just so one battery PM Kay PM Electronics PM given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip ME Yeah UI Uh sample speaker yeah PM Yeah yes or sample sensor yes UI Sample yeah this one PM Yes this one PM Okay PM Case PM Um I see I Double curve UI So So which one are we talking to ME Curved ME Double curved yeah right ME Its uh Are you talking about this or that ID Mm ID Yeah its gonna be more than just the biggest case definitely PM Mm UI Well Yeah ID Either of them PM Oh yes we are talking about but they have the same shape but actually bu So th th this would be double curves ME Mmhmm ID Mm ID Theyre both going to be not basic cases ID Mmhmm ME Yeah PM Kay PM Uh plastic would be the material ID Yeah ID The basic one yep UI Is it zero Franc ME A special colour PM Uh special colour now we leave it to the covers ME Uh Ah good ID So now were either going button or LCDs LCD display PM Push PM Mm yes but Yeah th now this is per per unit this number of components UI LCD is UI Its okay UI Just say LCD ID Is that price per unit or for the whole thing ID So it would need twelve buttons ME Yeah we might need a scroll wheel right for that UI No but for this one its twelve Euro ME No for that one also UI There are twelve PM So one two three four five six seven eight nine t Yes ME Yeah thats a scroll PM Twelve I believe PM So this comes to eighteen ID Mm ID And thats without any special button supplements ME Yeah one scroll wheel you might need PM So So I think but th do you agree th that thi Yes I Yes Im Im no Im no Im not sh sure ID So wed have a special colour special form and special material on all of them ID Theyre not just standard buttons ME Uh Bad estimate right UI Wait a minute its not its not double curved its single curved right UI Because its there is no like ID But I thought it would be curved on two its like its curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well thats what I thought UI Well its you know this curve like this so its w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave PM Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean yes ID You talking about concave curves PM Uhhuh UI So I think we can put um the single curved in the sixteen PM Both ID You think a single curved UI That makes uh seventeen UI And what are just The bt buttons we have twelve buttons are you sure UI Yeah ID Mm PM Yes PM Uh W d we have we havent talk about a but thats no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list ID We have more weve got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah The sc Mm UI So I had a bad uh bad estimation ID Weve got a scroll wheel for the volume dont we or is it some other thing thats not on there PM W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower UI No no no ID Kay weve only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast UI Yes a kind of scroll wheel ID So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave the sixteen Euros PM Mm PM Mmhmm UI Okay so based on that yeah um where is the es okay sample speaker But still yeah it No we cannot yeah ME That is the sample sensor and sample speaker PM So um Were We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip but then we cant have the the speech recognition yes ME We just need that actually ME We need one PM Yes PM So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition UI So But the um Yeah but if you have the near the LCD you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio TV and VCR and this needs a needs a advanced chip ME S Oh I i it I think its going to be y y yeah its th with the regular chip yeah PM Transti Say say its regular regular chip and we still on fifteen so Yes but that maybe Well we can just say one UI Right Matthew UI Or regular chip UI I think yeah regular today we you can do that with regular chip UI Yeah UI Okay UI Okay ME Yeah UI So UI And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew ME Uh Yeah UI When you look at this w this u uh item But You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low no PM Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty PM So is it possible ID But thats seven basic buttons right seven buttons without any addson without special colours or form or material ME Thatll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times PM Mmhmm PM No no he he he I I Mmhmm ID Well So the LCD display is is three Francs sorry three Euros by itself UI And uh we dont want to to change that right UI We we really want a LCD other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market ME Uh Or we could even replace them by buttons actually PM Mmhmm PM Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this UI Its evident UI Yeah ID Mm ID So twelve Euro fifty we got two off of the battery we cant do anything about that so ten fifty if we want an LCD dispra display thats seven fifty um so weve got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons UI And I dunno So wha what what each of us think about the because its measure point the LCD um Do you think its important PM Mm ID And the chip ID Sorry the chips up there already PM Mmhmm mmhmm ID So were gonna have to scale this down to get within budget theres no doubt about that PM A Mm Mm UI Because sometimes whe when you watch the TV in fact you have a big display and maybe you dont need one more in your hands UI I dunno Im just asking ME A actually it depends it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons or and youll have LCD display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least ID Mm ID Yep ID Mm ID Yeah ID I think unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the LCD display ME Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons UI Yeah its true yeah UI But uh do we want that UI On the market point of view yeah UI What do you think uh LCD is a major feature or PM I I think we have to come to a decision now just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the LCD uh display so Yes ID For the price its gonna be what we can afford and its looking like we cant afford the LCD display theres no way we can get it in there ID Mm ID Mmhmm UI You assume you want a democratic voyt vote right UI Okay PM Yes PM Yes UI Okay PM One man one vote PM S so who thinks the the LCD disply display should be i should be in it ID I th Id like t it to be in but I cant see it happening ID I cant see it fitting in PM Mm PM Mmhmm mmhmm ME I think but Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that UI We need to be ID Bu y youre a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager PM Mmhmm I know but Yes UI Yeah ID well we have to make a decision now thats it ME Yeah PM So uh uh having an LCD s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons PM Is that acceptable PM Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an Youve you you agree UI Yes ME W I I I just Yeah PM So hav hav having seven buttons instead of twelve PM So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons UI Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here PM Mm UI Here one at the middle and at the bottom ID Mm ID I think then we were really losing ease of use UI Okay ME That will create another problem ME For the people to use it ME Its not going to be easy ID Okay UI Okay PM Mm ME Doing that PM So um I I think we should we should cut the LCD screen PM That thats thats my opinion ME No its okay you uh cut the LCD screen and introduce two more buttons PM Just Uh where LC Okay w we now we can just uh Yes ID Okay ID So LCDs out is speech rec out now ID Weve Yep UI The speech recognition is out UI Because of the budget yeah ID Yep ID So are we basically back to the original one now back to the first version ID Which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much ME Yeah ID With these new costings UI Yes ID So just look at forget that one and look at that one now UI Yeah PM Yes PM I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price okay ID Mm ID Yep ID Okay PM My m my supervisor will be glad that its fifty cents cheaper than he expected ID Well thats thats Yep UI Actually yeah we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount yeah ID So ID Mm ME Yeah ID Yep PM Okay ID So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but thats all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment PM Okay good PM Then we the same PM Thank you ME Okay PM That was it ID Mmhmm ME Thats it UI Thanks ME Cool ID Okay,"As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth. It also has a power button, channel up/down, slow pause/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone. It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel, innovation, ease of use, appeal to the correct demographic, and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. They discuss the energy source, shape, chip type, LCD and speech recognition, and additional buttons. After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. They close the meeting by thanking one another."
PM How do you wear this thing ID Hmm ID Mm mm mm PM Not too many cables and stuff PM Original ID Is recorded ID Okay ID Okay so welcome everyone ID So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control ID So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it ID And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process ID So sorry PM Uh PM Just one thing PM Uh you said twentyfive minutes but I have something else to do uh so gotta have another meeting uh soon so maybe you could hurry up a bit Its true PM I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah ID You have another meeting soon ID So you have to be quick PM Yeah for the lawnmower project ID Okay PM Okay ID So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be userfriendly ID So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points ID First it will be the functional design ID Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design ID So the functional design is to identify the main user needs the technical function the remote control should fulfil ID And then we will move to f conceptual design where well specify the different component involved what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that ID And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice weve uh made in the second point ID So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board PM What an original idea ID Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us PM Orangutan ID Okay thats good UI No no n You should write y the name I think ID n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh Ill let you uh comment PM Can I give you the no PM But I dont have to say anything PM When Im drawing the orangutan PM Its an abstract drawing of an orangutan ID Okay its an abstract drawing PM Yes ID I think its nice and original PM I dont have a red colour PM Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I dont have red pen so Yes ID Okay ID You want to draw something Christine ME Okay uh sorry ME You have to imagine a little bit um ME This Sorry too uh ID Of course your animal is recorded so its not lost PM Yes PM I know ID Is this uh Ah okay its pretty PM Wha what is this strange beast ME Is it beautiful PM Is it a monster ME Do you know ME Its a cat PM Its a cat ME Isnt it PM I thought these things did not exist ME Yes yes is it like that UI Me Ah yeah ME Is it better PM Ah yeah Does have a name UI Yeah ME Okay ME Its my cat ID Okay its your cat ME Yeah ME The name is Caramel PM Caramel UI Caramel PM Ahha ME Yeah ID Okay ID Olivier do you want to Okay I go but next time youll do something Im sure UI And you I think Im too short for the cables PM Next time I concentrate ID Im a bit short on cable ID Okay ID So what could I draw ID Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow ID I dont know if it looks like a cow Like a what PM He looks like a bong PM Okay PM Sorry PM No UI Quite squarey PM Scary UI He also ID I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say UI Mm PM I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos no ID Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control PM Thats I is there a matter for a new remote control ID Okay ID Lets move on ID So Here the uh financial objective of our project ID That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros ID Yeah if its trendy original I d fulfil the user needs PM Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multidevice remote control ID We have to discuss that point PM Ah this is not defined at all ID On yeah you you can suggest points like this PM Ah okay ID So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple ID So whats what are your ideas about that ID Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side PM Well uh do we sell other stuff PM Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us ID Okay so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device PM Yeah ID Do you agree UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID So maybe it should be for multiple devices ID And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil UI I think we shouldnt have too many b for my part PM No I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now UI I think If we dont have so many buttons could be nice ID Few buttons ID Okay ID And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ID Might be a good idea UI Yeah ID Okay ID And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain what it shouldnt it should look like or things like that UI Something which is not squarey maybe uh not a box PM Mm ID With rou okay ID Like for okay PM Something like that least fits in your hand UI Yeah ID Okay PM Yeah PM The basic requirement ID So ID Fit in your hand yeah PM Only a buck ID And also it have i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall UI Mmhmm PM Waterproof ID Waterproof as well UI And I think we should have a device Sorry ID Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others cant ID Maybe waterproof would be very original ID Havin having a waterproof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath PM Mm ID That could be uh Yeah but it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well PM B it seems uh so but uh if you dont have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And and thats one of the thats one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that its going to break and they put some extra plastic around it PM Thats people they actually do it themselves UI Yeah UI directly PM I it will look a bulky in that case ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Maybe we can sell uh all that together so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well ID That might be good uh track to follow PM Like as an optional thing ID Optional or selled with it UI And I I think we should have something most of the time I I lose my remote control UI We should have s uh special bu button on the TV to make the remote control beeping ID Yeah ID Maybe we can have uh But we dont design the TV UI Ah yeah ID Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep UI Yeah PM Barks ID Yeah barks yeah UI Barks ID So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control UI Yeah UI Yeah whistle ID I dont know whistleable UI Whistle tracking ID Th Whistle tracking yeah ID Whistle tracking remote control ID Thats a good idea thats very original and thats can uh improve PM Thats thats quite cool but uh of course we you dont normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ID Yeah d d uh PM So i its just going to add t to the cost ID Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors ID I think this is a good advantage PM Its cool PM I think I like the idea but Im not sure about the what you who is giving whos giving whos giving our budget ID Yeah ID We have to ask Yeah PM Whos Yeah ID We have to ask the quest of thats uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer PM Yeah UI Yeah ID Which is you PM Kay UI yeah Okay ID Okay so try to find that for next meeting ID Okay ID So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh UI Dont panic ID Dont pani ID So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed UI Mmhmm ID So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons the the fact that is lighted or not things like that and what would be convenient for the user PM Mmhmm ID And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user ID So ID And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon PM Mm ID So ID Thank you I think thats all for this point PM Good UI Mmhmm PM Uh so we come back in five minutes PM Half an hour ID Anyway you will receive some messages ID Be careful ID You eat it ID Does it move uh ID Okay but I dont know if it uh is still correctly uh Well see UI Ah,"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices, protection from water or from dropping the remote, and a locator function. The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements, and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting."
UI Okay ID Okay everyones ready PM Hello ID So we are here for uh for uh functional design ID Okay ID So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification technical function design and working design ID Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board ID Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting ID Of the of the process ID So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ME Mm UI F do you want to start PM Make a start yeah ID You can start PM So PM Cable camera ID You have uh PowerPoint PM Should be in my in their folder no ID Ah yeah maybe there PM Up ID Okay ID Who are you PM Um at three I think PM No PM Mm ID Ouch ID And We have a technical problem uh UI Okay PM Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe PM It is possible ID You put it on Yeah UI No PM It was somewhere in something like this PM I dont remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something UI What do you have in short cut PM Go up UI Participant two PM Yeah go up PM Again PM No PM Go back ID You have no Over PM Uh maybe messenger AMI PM Messenger ID Okay PM No PM There is nothing ID Theres no We have a technical problem PM Lets go and check UI Yeah PM Ill go and check UI Otherwise could you just describe by hand PM Okay UI With the the whiteboard PM Yeah ID If you remember yeah but thats Yeah PM Yeah PM So uh PM Basically what we want here is a remote control right PM So um the question well first of all what to control PM So most people want to have a a remote for their hifi and TV and stuff like that UI Mmhmm PM And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Yeah so theres a project I think called X house or something like that that does that uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff UI Mmhmm PM So there is one that is one thing PM The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever PM Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah UI Okay UI Mmhmm PM So I think it should be a package in that case PM Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts PM One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part PM Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices a set of buttons for special navigation in space a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Okay PM Yeah UI What do you mean by linear access then PM Like a video tape goes forward backwards uh fast and stuff yeah UI Ah PM Um ID Okay so special navigation linear access random access and theres a fourth one no PM Mm ID So the better now for special navigation PM Yeah PM For special navigation for example you might have a TV in the menu and you going to change yeah ID Okay ID Then linear access then random access PM Uh PM Mm PM Yeah and also parameter changing ID Ah yeah parameter okay PM So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay and and voice command did you uh Okay PM Voice command w we could specify anything PM We could assign any button a command to any button if we have enough processing power I guess so ID Okay PM Yeah ID Okay PM Yeah ID So thats uh that close your investigations PM Yeah PM Uh yeah I think so ID Okay PM Not so far ID Okay ID Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with I dunno if I can open it ME Yeah ME Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here ID Maybe you can s Its Messenger no ME Uh in yeah okay ME No ME In document ME Mm computer yeah ID In which folder PM Where did you put it ME Here ME Here ID Shortcut to AMI shared folder PM mm ME But its not Um ID Maybe you can send it to me by email ID Just to participant one ID At AMI ME Mmhmm ME Yeah I can do that ID I will try to show it to everyone that would be more comfortable ME Okay ME Um ID You send it ME Its participant one ID Yeah ID Uh this is this email PM Im designing the user interface ME Okay ME You can uh ID Okay ID So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask that will be more convenient ME Yeah ID So okay functional requirements ME Okay so you can you can go ME Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay ID Mm ID Yeah ME And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice more kind ME Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy ME Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to its not good ME So okay ME So its not in theory but I I can I can say yeah ID We can just keep doing that ID Yeah ME Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot ME So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that ME Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks ID Okay ME Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control ID Okay ME So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or Yeah ID Okay ID Okay so fewer buttons maybe would be good ME F not many buttons and uh and uh uh u useable buttons ID Okay PM But what kind of remote controls did you look at ME Sorry PM What kind of task was it PM It was a TV ME Yeah ME Uh most for most is TV ID Yeah ID Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a TV remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following PM Huh PM Uhhuh PM Ah Good ID Okay ME Kay you can go so ME So there are other frustrations expressed by users so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it ID Yeah ID To find it ID Yeah ME Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control ID Yeah ME So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use UI Mmhmm ID Okay ME And uh remote controls are bad for RSI um I dunno ID What is her other side PM Other side yeah yo wa your wrist PM It i can become painful you can have tendonditis ID Oh yeah PM Yeah ID I did not knew that PM If you also up on a computer in a strange position ID Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah PM Ergonomic PM But uh PM Have to say ha ha ME Yeah ID Its your job Oh ME Uh ID Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft ME Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel ID Yeah ID Yeah yeah ID Yeah ME Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that ID Okay ID Yeah UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Okay ME So its better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and Very accessible yes ID Yeah ID This function should be very uh accessible ID Yeah okay ME Thats right ID This is the main function okay ME So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an LCD screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah PM The first question ME So you know that um for the younger its very important to have the s yes and speech recognition ID To have LCD and voice ME And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot TV and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh ID Okay ME So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in ID Yeah maybe this this is important ME Yeah ID Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so PM Mm ME Mm ID Yeah ME Okay and if there is th the conclusion now ME So as we say before I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark its its a good thing ID Okay ME Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to An I s no yeah ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Okay ID Okay these are the user requi Yeah ME I dunno if you see something else important or Mm UI Im just thinking of some thing UI Um We want to have a no I dont know if this is a good idea UI We want to have a a general remote control for everything ID No no no ID We w it seems that we no want to have a TV remote control UI Okay ID From the management board I receive an email PM Mm UI Yeah ID Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah PM Mm I its not true I think PM The the second claim that you put UI No no ID That it would be too long to develop PM Yeah PM I think that should be the same ID Oh yeah ID Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on TV more where it seems that the market is more important ID So maybe its a good decision ID I dunno ID Whats your opinion PM I have uh Ive no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it PM I dont think Uh yeah UI Finish tonight PM Yeah PM Okay UI But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so PM Yeah ID Okay ME Yeah PM Yeah UI So Im just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control ID Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I dont know UI If fact Yeah but Do I have oh yeah ME Mm UI Now I have enough cables PM Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff UI Okay so Im just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy UI We just have sorry Im going Like that ID Okay ID Are you okay UI Im just going to describe UI Basically we have a a battery a power supply here UI After that we just have um user interface UI Lets say that um something like that which could be um a LCD lets say or um an array of push button something like that UI Push button or a LCD UI After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip UI So I say UC and I feed that to uh LED which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component UI And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy ID UC is the central unit UI Yeah ID Okay yeah UI Y its a its this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display ID Computation ID Okay UI And so for us uh this is quite easy UI We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television ID Okay UI So for us this is quite easy ID Okay so this is quite easy UI Yeah UI Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple Yeah of course of course ID There is not that much constraints PM This will think this will take more time to develop also PM Yeah UI And um but for a standard one this is really easy UI Its a question of one month and so on s No no no no I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that PM Soon ID To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ID Standard button one PM Yeah PM So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Definitely PM Yeah ID So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now UI I would say PM Ten years UI I would say uh about eight months to have the first results ID Okay so i its a bit long yeah UI Yeah UI I can Um ID One month for the standard one with button UI Yeah ID Even if we have a LCD display UI Yeah even UI I mean that this is really standard devices now UI Um eight UI For uh speech recognition ID Okay yeah ID Okay so we can take this into account ID So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition PM But we dont have time to market UI And also how much uh I think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldnt we shouldnt go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a Yeah but how many yeah ID Yeah it will PM I think we should contact management ID Euros ID Yeah yeah PM Well ID Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros PM Uh How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no one hundred thousand units PM Eh chips PM Were gonna need chips right UI Yeah PM Yeah PM How much will it cost for one hundred thousand UI Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip PM Okay ID Because we are It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting PM So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition UI Yeah we can Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Okay PM So PM No it doesnt PM Okay PM Four million ID Okay ID Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have ME Mm UI Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ID Yeah I I will continue UI Is it Um you say that I dont remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say thats its quite difficult to to to use the remote control ID Well ask your question if you want ME Mm ME Yeah UI Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ME Oh UI To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that ME Would j Uh yeah w I I think they they say that its uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it its its okay UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Okay UI And But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ME But Yeah ID Its not intuitive first UI You say that I want I have six button Yeah PM Mhhmm PM A a lot of people are uh if you have the LCD screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so its really something for the expert user ID Yeah UI Yeah ID But but also it seems that Yeah UI Yeah UI Okay PM So I mean there are markets and markets PM I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah PM So for our young people uh it will be cool they can be able to use it PM Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it PM I guess PM I dont know if there is study about that ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product ME Mm UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Mm ME Mm PM And there are another thing is that if we make something thats simple and easy to use thats bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else UI Yeah UI Yeah PM All right UI Yeah PM Otherwise if its different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first UI Yeah ID Yeah ID But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons ME Mm PM Mmhmm ID So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control PM Yeah ID Losed lose it etcetera PM Mmhmm ID These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop ME Mm PM Mmhmm ID So but le let us see first the new requirement ID So we dont have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we dont have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff PM But teletext is just one button PM You you just write the write the numbers ID Yeah ID So well Yeah PM So will you add with the channel keys right PM So ID So anyway we dont have to include this feature because its its not used any more by users they prefer to s Yeah PM I am PM Im sure that uh it dont like but uh I dont see just one button PM So ID I dunno ID If i one button is still one more button ID If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors PM Mmhmm ID Well anyway I have this point ID We can discuss ID Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if its only for the TV um because we want to be quick on on the market ID And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product ID So this is the the key point ID So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera PM Capital ME Mm ID So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point no ME Mm UI Mmhmm ME Mm PM Well if it is going to be just a TV remote control it is going to be very simple ID Yeah okay ID So yeah the key point here is simple ID Maybe ID So few buttons channel volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that PM Well if its going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control there is no other function that I can see really ID Yeah ID Maybe switch TV on and off Yeah PM Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us PM Or something ID Yeah ID Volume maybe a mute button and then on off button UI Mm ID And thats all UI Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping ME Mmhmm ID Mm UI I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now you have a button you you press it and this is uh the previous channel which has come back PM Its a memory yeah ID Okay ID Yeah this is cool ID Maybe we can include that also ID Previous previous channel button ID So we have like channel button the previous channel button the volume button plus a mute button and uh just the the traditional on off button UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM And uh and of course the channel changing buttons ID Yeah ID I I talk about that yeah PM How should they how should we implement that PM Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental ID Yeah ID Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them PM Mmhmm UI Lets say that we can do something like that UI This is uh incremental but once you press it for a long time you go five by five ID We go faster UI To go fa to go faster ID Mm PM Mm PM Its an interesting idea that if you press it for a long time it does something else in general PM So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No UI Yeah PM Doesnt work does it ID Maybe we should have also a digit button Yeah PM Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands PM Change channel to eight PM No ID Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental ID I dunno bec because if you have the Uh PM Well if its useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental ID Yeah ID Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only its not uh it isnt worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ID So I think we need also digits UI Okay ID Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits PM Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and Yeah ID Yeah UI Or we can do something like that UI We can design the remote control to have access UI You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y You Yeah a kind of joystick PM Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this PM Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental PM Yeah ID Okay ID So have a wheel for incremental have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected and uh yeah I think this is the basi And do we do we have a No a wheel is better UI Mmhmm PM Mmhmm PM On the lower side I think it you have to turn it PM No PM If we do that UI Or a or a ball yeah not a a wheel but a ball and you say uh to Yeah PM Yeah ID I would say the wheel is better PM Because of that Because its uh its its not like a volume which is smooth yeah ID What is the expert of uh Okay PM The channels change one by one UI Yeah PM So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit UI Yeah the yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Thats a good idea ID Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control UI S quite its quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel ID Okay PM Yeah PM Even if i LED uh or a if if its the LCD feature uh whatever yeah UI A blue a blue LED and we sell that um ID Yeah and do we put an LCD display PM Yeah ID Because it was important for young customers if you remember PM I think its only put on if cou have multi function UI Yeah PM If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having LCD PM Just increase the cost ID Okay PM The user does not have an advantage really ID So no LCD UI Mmhmm ME Hmm ID And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process UI Okay PM Well if its going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool PM It would PM Because a user could say CNN for example and it would go CNN ME Mmhmm PM Mm ID Yeah ID That would be cool ID But eight months is really long and Maybe we can just uh Okay PM Yeah UI Ten years Mmhmm ID So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent ID So thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you cant see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided UI Okay UI Okay UI Okay ID Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether PM Yeah ID That would be easier ME Mm PM What is the folder that you put yours in PM And did it it did work ME No ID No it did not work ME No no ID She send it to me by email PM Ah yeah ME I dunno I dunno it PM Mm PM Okay ID So maybe this is better to send it by email PM Okay what is your email ID Okay ID So yeah I Im its in the first uh email so Im participant one at AMI uh where is that its here PM At participant one PM Okay ID Participant one at AMI ID Okay ID So see you after lunch break ME Kay thank you PM Well during lunch break actually PM So next time we should have a fight PM How about uh management or something PM Who happens to be your friend,"The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints."
ID Okay UI Mmhmm ID So we are here for the concept design meeting ID So we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision weve taken ID Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards ID So each of you will uh show us the various investigation theyve done during uh previous uh hours ID Well then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task to have to be done before the next meeting ID So last time we decided to have a simple interface ID We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button ID Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple ID We have also button for volume and to switch on off the TV ID We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no LCD no voice features ID So now uh we will have three presentations ID So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer the specification of the UI by or UI okay UI Abdul alHasred is my name ID And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert ID So maybe we can start with uh industrial design ID So this is the presentation PM Uh ID you want ID Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request PM Yeah PM I only v have three slides so PM I just look at the mm um just this PM On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is as I s mentioned previously you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control ID Yeah PM So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip which is uh very very standard and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button PM And um yeah we can change directly ID Yeah PM In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control PM The push button are usually extremely cheap but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor which seems to be quite expensive ID Okay UI Mmhmm PM And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button ID Okay PM Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button UI Yeah ID But is it a significant price on the whole remote control UI Mm ID Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control PM Yeah PM Yeah I I th But I dont think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money ID So will will will this with uh including all possible things so buttons wheel and the chip be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce UI Yeah ID Okay You received something Hmm UI Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition PM But Um thats all yeah UI No PM I havent chec Mmhmm UI Yeah UI You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed UI Says Yeah UI It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions UI But I guess it could be I guess its possible ID And could it be adapted UI I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command ID Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff UI Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it ID Okay ID Yeah ID Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news UI Okay PM Yeah but I think its yeah Sorry I havent written my personal references PM Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button and if we could reduce that ID Okay PM We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button UI Mmhmm UI I have a question about that actually UI Um what is the purpose of the light PM Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah UI Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on the light ID You can easily find the button in the dark or so ID It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think no UI But if you move it then you have it you dont need to find it ID Hmm UI You can see the buttons better of course ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah ID True PM Actually UI But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement PM As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light UI Yeah but you need another sensor for that right PM Yeah PM Again UI Yeah no its too expensive PM I dont think that this is really expensive but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control when you want to turn off your device Yeah a little bit UI Okay UI Mm UI Extra UI Yeah okay UI Mm UI Yeah but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so yeah UI Mm UI Mmhmm ID But it can be uh battery consuming no ID To have the light always on PM A little bit UI Mm ID Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations PM Yeah UI Okay UI So uh my one it uh should be in the shared folder ID Yeah UI So UI It was last time I saw it ID And it is UI Okay UI So just move to the next slide ID Okay UI So basically want very simple right UI Thats the major idea as simple as possible ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So I just look at some current designs uh on the web of usually more complicated remote controls UI And lets look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple UI And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we dont need and it become even simpler ID Yeah UI Um UI So ID And also does it uh fit well in hand ID Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage UI Yeah UI Well this these uh these remotes are quite big so go to the next page so UI We have all these buttons as you can see but most of them we just need the ones in the middle ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah UI So from the bottom or whatever is there uh the uh the numbers and then the top uh until the ten also this middle part and on the left one is exactly the same ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So its basically more or less how we would like it with a big volume control big channel control and mute and power yeah ID Yeah UI These are the basic thing ID So its only the central part UI So basically w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two ID Yeah ID With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part UI Yeah if you have for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb UI It could be on the right side for example ID Yeah ID Okay UI Yeah UI Because we dont have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have UI And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it it can break you ca you can do various things ID Okay UI Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way ID Okay ID S Okay UI So that theyre separate a bit yeah ID Will be down or Okay UI Uh and its easy to press the other the big buttons but uh its not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either UI Mm UI Yeah I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user ID Okay UI Alright you wont yeah UI Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally dont mess with like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that ID Okay UI Yeah UI That you want to protect a bit UI And I think its uh its reasonable ID Okay UI So I dont think Yeah this is just the the wheel UI We could use the some wheels can be pushed down could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want ID Mm PM Mmhmm UI Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case ID Yeah ID Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors PM Mmhmm ID Because otherwise its pretty standard apart the fact that its very simple ID So maybe its worse to uh to have more expense on thats that aspect PM To s Mmhmm UI Yeah I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that ID Okay ID So we can move to the Is there any question ID For designer of user interface ID or we can move to the next part maybe and discuss afterwards ID Okay ME Okay I can go ME Can I ID Yeah ME So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um ME So the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel ME And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative ID Okay ME And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use ME So are things we are we have uh speak about before UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ME Yeah ME And um so you you can go after ID Yeah ME And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furnitures ME So maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy ID Okay PM I support an apple ME Uh I dont know which material can be spongy and if you Mmhmm ID Yeah ID This is good also for Yeah UI Well wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing it it would work right PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ID I think it is good also f to have a spongy material yeah UI You can throw it to the television ID Yeah because its robust ME Okay Its robust yeah PM Yeah PM Me too UI Hey thats a cool one UI We could say that if you throw it you have a sensor and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off UI When it d uh takes a shock ID Yeah uh sorry PM Ah its okay ME Not good PM I know that they do that for alarm clock also ME An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that UI Yeah ME You ca uh you can go uh before before yes ID No ID Yeah ID Before ME And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel after is uh technological innovative and after the easy to use ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah ID I think its innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has PM Yeah ME Yeah thats why Yeah thats why I think we have to keep that if its possible ID Has it ID Yeah ID I think its it makes it both easy and both innos innovative PM Mmhmm ME Innovative ID So I think its a good aspect and it should be kept ME Mm UI How do we make it look cool is the question ID Cool fancy UI Yeah ID We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable ME Yeah ID Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh things like that PM What about um And for maybe look and feel what about a a piece of ice with blue LED inside ME Mm ME Oh colour yeah UI Well the obvious thing is a banana I guess ME Oh i i I thought about a a pear for example ID Maybe yeah ME You know the pear is like that and its its easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah ID Yeah and its ergonomic as well ID A pear UI The banana is also ergonomic ID Yeah ID Maybe pear yeah or something like that ME Or a fruit like that ME I dunno ID Yeah ID We can discuss that uh ID D D Is is there anything you want to add UI Is there any fruit that is spongy ID I dont think so ID I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good fit well or banana as you told UI Yeah ID Something like that ID But thats not in the trend UI You can make it um Its not hard the metal PM Yeah ID The trend is spongy and vegetable fruits PM Yeah PM Yeah ID I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well UI Plastic PM Yep ID So I think we can keep the wheel because its uh easy its innovative even if the cost is a bit higher and we also have to find a so a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have PM Yeah ID What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your TV with UI Mm ID Odi Banana is also yellow so you you cant lost your remote control then PM Banana I think its a nice idea PM Because But You y you dont use the banana when the banana is curving like that but when the banana is curving like that with the wheel on the top and to control and here you have a a push button to Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Two of the button yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah ME But you dont have Yeah ID I think its a good idea yeah UI Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve yeah and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side ID Yeah UI So you can have it on on two sides and itll be cool no ID Yeah ID I think its a good design and its innovative as well then ID Maybe we can keep the banana ID And it will be very easy to find UI You can put also vibrator inside PM And everybody knows what is a banana PM Basically PM If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery UI Ahha UI You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah its really uh really a good point UI I hope the students of management die but anyway UI Now who are recording this meeting ID I think it So One second ID So we have to take some decision on this aspect ID So uh so for sorry for uh component so we have to think about those aspects sorry ID Yeah PM And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use PM Uh what do you mean by case ID I think its the box that should be spongy bananas shape PM Yeah PM Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case doesnt matter PM I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box and thats it UI The only th Yeah UI Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah UI But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if its spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if its spongy then its going to move right PM Spongy also UI So its going to be bend a lot UI So if we try to push the buttons it You think its possible PM Oh no I think its possible ID But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped with a spongy cover PM Yeah UI Okay PM Yeah PM This is uh like the Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Okay odd shape with spongy cover ID And standard battery okay a chip imprint theres no specific problem ID So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical PM Wheel on the top PM Button where do we want some buttons UI Well usually hold Kay we want it to be good also for the lefthand users right PM Yeah UI Uh Yeah but okay UI Sa lets say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb PM Yep PM Yep UI Basically UI Or you could use use this one but I dont know if its very comfortable to use this one for the wheel ID Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable UI This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ID Yeah I think its okay for both right and left UI Should have the two sides PM Mmhmm ID Mm UI So if the left we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons ID I think you can turn it this way also ID You can do both with both hands UI Yeah the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around the buttons are on the other side ID I think its okay UI So you cannot see them ID Well you you will get used to it UI Yeah ID And moreover th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side because you have light on buttons UI So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know but uh if you hold with your left hand and the wheel is here and the buttons are here then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side ID Yeah ID No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand whether you are righty or lefty ID I think for lefty its okay ID I can do this movement and for righty as well ID I think this doesnt change that much UI Okay ID Yeah UI Okay UI Maybe UI Yeah ID So for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side ID And and uh a wheel on the top PM Mmhmm UI Yeah ID So the colour is yellow ID I think its uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take yeah ID So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting ID So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision ID And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product ID That is to say uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay ID It seems to be fancy innovative and easy to use PM Mmhmm ID So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together ID That would uh be better I think PM Yeah ID And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails as usual UI Mmhmm ID So do you need to add anything UI Yes master UI No ID You feel okay UI Yeah ID You feel uh free to express what you want to say UI Yeah ID You dont feel too constrained UI No ID You dont feel free to answer this UI Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay ID Okay so See you PM Thank you,"The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype, and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype. He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions. The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design. A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design. The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design. They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype, and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting."
ID Okay ID Je croix que cest dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype ID It really looks like a banana UI It is a banana ID It is a banana UI It is the essence of bananas UI I would be confused with this thing ID Mm UI S How is everyone ME Mmhmm ID Okay ID Hi PM Hi ID So we are here for the detailed design meeting UI Mmhmm ID So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting ID Then uh Ive I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual ID We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work ID And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product ID Then we will uh evaluate the product ID And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not PM Mmhmm ID So d lets start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time that is to say uh to have a standard battery to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera UI Like a banana PM Mmhmm ID And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros ID So which is uh good because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros PM Mmhmm ID So for the financial aspect its okay we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert ME Yeah ME Okay ME So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four ID Yeah ID You have a presentation ID Participant four yes ME Evaluation ID Okay ID Okay ME Okay ME So you can go ME We can go through ID Okay ME So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings ME So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points ID Okay ME We we talked about before ID Okay ME So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel technologically innovative easy to use fashion easy to find in a room and robust uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points ID Yeah PM Mmhmm ID Yeah ME Okay ME So I go through all the uh all the points here and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point two point or seven point ID Yeah ME Okay ID Okay ME And after we ha we have an an average and uh we see PM Mmhmm ID Okay ME The okay ME Uh so uh fancy look and feel what do you think ID Okay ID Maybe you can presen okay ME F between o one and seven ID Maybe hold it ID So I think its uh very uh very nice UI I give it a I give it a five ID What do you think ID Yeah ID So its between one and seven ME Yeah ID Seven is the highest uh ME Seven is the Mmhmm ID I will give a six PM I will give a a five UI And you ME sorry UI Do you vote uh Christine ME eh UI Do you also vote ME No I just want to see something Mmhmm ID Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah UI Well we can very easily ME Uh I think uh and need to as well ID No problem ME Need to uh I dont know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If its better or Uhuh ID So this is your One is most UI I So it will have five point five average ME Um ID Well we can choose what we want ME Yeah ID Okay lets say that seven is the best ME Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm ID Okay ID So so do note the grade we have five six for me five PM Five ID And what whats your choice ME Oh sorry ME Six Uh s you can how much what ID How much would you give on the fancy aspect on the fashionable aspect ID How much would you you dont answer to this uh questionnaire ME Oh yes I mm I dunno mm I think six its a good uh Yeah ID Five point five average ME Wa can ID Okay UI Mm ME Okay ID Well does it Okay techne technological aspect ME I sorry ME Okay ME So after the technological aspect ME So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel ID Yeah we have the wheel ME Uh ID We also have the rubber material which make it uh like new also ID I think I would give a five UI Its four ID Four PM A four also because except for the wheel we dont have so much innovation UI Yeah PM The rubber is Uh a four ID Okay UI D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not PM I I Yeah ID No UI Huh UI No UI Okay ID So whats your uh grade ME No ME Four ID Four ID So we have four four f and five ME We can put four UI Yeah UI For twenty five ID Yeah four ME Everyone is okay or four poin Four ID Four yeah lets put four UI Yeah ME Okay ID Doesnt it Yeah I think so ME Very easy to use ME Do you think its easy to use UI I give a seven I think ID Yeah PM Six ID I would give a I would give a seven as well ID Its very easy to use ME Mm six for me also PM Six ID So six point five ME Six point five UI Kay PM Six six six point five ME Okay ID Okay ME Is it fashion ID Oh yeah its its f its fruit fruit shape ME Seven ID I would say seven ID And is very very nice design ME Yeah its fashion because its a fruit and we say that the yeah seven UI Yeah we can we can put a seven here UI Yeah PM Yeah seven ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Seven okay UI Well we hope PM Easy to find ME Uh easy to find in a room PM I lost my banana ID I think you cant miss it UI Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay PM Uh UI Yeah I think its cool UI I think we can put a six here ME We have the lightning or The lighting ID Yeah we have the we dont sesh especially have the lightning but So its yellow UI So youll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely or Yeah ID Its okay ID I think its very easy to I would say seven ME Yeah ME Seven ID Its hard to miss it PM Six PM Yeah okay ME Is it is it robust ID Yeah its rubber made of rubber I think its m its uh more rubber than uh other remote control PM Uh f yeah its ru its rubber PM Yeah UI Yeah the only problem there might be which know i if its very sensitive they will I dont know Yeah okay ID Yeah PM Yeah ID But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material PM Yeah ID So maybe we can put a six PM Yeah UI Mm PM Six or five ME Everybody is okay six PM Five ID Six is okay UI Six yeah for me PM Six ME Yeah ME Okay ID Yeah UI Yeah ME S now um so ID Tadada ID We have to sum up everything UI Twenty ME Thirteen uh twenty twenty six point five uh seven thirty two thirty six UI Thirty UI Thir Okay ME Thats thats okay ME Six ID Six is a good Yeah the be ME Good ME Uh if we say that seven its uh its the better and when uh s six sit six are good its a good uh p product I think UI Yeah the top Mm ID Okay so six is a So its a good evaluation I think UI So will become eight soon ID Its very promising UI Yeah well its a bit biased ME We have a good price and uh ID Huh PM Yeah UI Okay ME Good ID So this prototype is quite nice UI Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped uh wireless phones not mobile ones wireless for the house uh quite big also and they were selling something like a hundred Euros two hundred Euros ID Yeah ID Okay UI Just a just a phone wireless PM Mmhmm ID So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive I think UI Yeah ID I think the Yeah PM But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare UI Yeah UI Yeah its much more complex but Okay ID So I think we can summarise ID So we have seen the prototype ID Its very nice according to the work of our two designer ID The the the financial aspect were okay ID We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit ID The the evaluation give satisfying result as well ID So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting ID So the cost is in the budget the evaluation is okay so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party PM Start to eat banana ID I dont know if its provided by uh by the meeting staff ME Mmhmm ID Okay so congratulation PM Yeah UI Congratulations to the team ID Nice product UI Uh very well we worked together fantastically ID Yeah ID I think it was a good collaboration uh ID Aspect UI So what does the management say ID Sorry UI What does the management say ID I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well UI Ah ID All it depends on who watch this meeting PM Yeah ID We dont know UI Yeah ID Okay so good guys so see you for next uh successful project UI Okay PM Okay PM Yeah PM Fruits ME Mm kay UI Mm,The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting.
ID So we are here to talk about functional design ID Now hopefully weve all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now ID So heres an agenda ID Uh Ill open ID Um you should know that Ill be taking minutes during all the meetings as I was struggling to our last time uh and thatll be easier for me now because Im not actually giving the whole presentation ID Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful ID Um now you can all give your presentations ID We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions ID Right forty minutes for this meeting so a bit more time than the last one ID Heres the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them ID Uh did you all receive that email PM Yep ME Yeah ID So does anyone have any overall Mm ME Well uh what comes up for me is that if were gonna if were gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext and so were not were gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now ID Mm ID Yep ME So thats from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack ID Mm ME And so we have to go I think in the other direction ME What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Right ID Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity thats presented I guess ME Yeah ME No I I agree with you ME So what Im talking about is I see that one side were eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesnt have teletext it has tatatatata ID Okay ME So thats thats that was my reactions ID Okay ID Yeah ID but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television ME Yeah yeah ID So were quite fixed ME Yep ID So were really probably in terms of marketing are looking for thats uh thats a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product ME Okay UI Yeah bu but we were designing only the remote we not design the TV ID Yeah ID Hmm UI So uh were gonna be removing the teletext out of any TV that we people use our remote with ME Yeah ME Kay ME Thats right ID Hmm ME I think we take with you UI So its kind of a stupid decision ID But theres also the potential for mark theres a market here for our lost teletext PM Right ID For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible ID Twentyfive Euros is the selling price we really have to innovate here I guess ME Thats what Im thats what Im talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product cause somebody some people are gonna be hap unhappy cause it took they cant ac access their teletext ID Mm ME Okay ME Cause were talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninetyfive percent of the televisions out there are are teletext ID K yeah ME So so its its not that Im criticizing the product at all ME Its just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ME What are we bringing in to take the place of this and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up ID Mm kay ME If we lose one we need to bring two or three ID Okay ID Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward ID Obviously the the w it has to be branded UI So then the double R will be our our I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro RollsRoyce might mind but dont worry ID Kay ID On the product yeah PM I think one of I think w yeah one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when were doing this I mean our companys slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right ID Can you handle that black and yellow PM So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well but I think one of the main selling points is that we dont want it to be clunky like like this thing here PM You know we dont wanna a big clunker ID Mm PM We want something that looks nice and its fashionable and so Thats fine ME So you have this ID Nah ID So we have three presentations and I think well go in order of participant number here ID So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two ID Thats Okay UI Yes PM Okay so so you all know me Im the Industrial Designer ID Mm its enough ID But uh click it on off PM And weve some basic components that um our remote is gonna need just basically every remotell need em PM We need some kinda of power d power source PM Um we have to decide on our our user interface which is his department but the in user interface is also a major component PM Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal which we pass to the infrared LED which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal PM You need a onoff switch um I dont know how that got in there PM And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs PM So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so thatll require some memory as well PM Um so heres just a basic layout of how how the remote would work PM You ha the v the power source is in the upper righthand corner there and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing and then passes that signal on to the infrared LED and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the phototransistor PM So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around ME Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um This is not this is not cutting edge technology were talking here PM I think any des No ME Were talking about existing technology PM Right I think Yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote ME Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries PM We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip ME Okay ME Okay ID Do we have an idea of costs of different components PM But Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well PM Um the LED and the the transistors and everything else are you know theyre theyre pretty cheap ID Kay PM So depending on what we want our functionality to be um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap PM Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power ID Mm kay ID Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ID No PM Uh I dont have any figures right now ID Kay PM We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that ID Yeah ME N okay PM Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that I think ME Mm ME Mm the shell PM Yeah PM Basically yeah ME Okay ID Okay PM So yeah PM Thats all I have really ID Okay ID Thanks ID And we have participant three which I believe is Pedro UI I Hey mouse ID I can give you that to click on UI Open ID And you wanna get View a slide show thats what you wanna do yeah UI When were fighting over its also more lot more fun ID Just go up to view UI Uh PM Click dont Yeah ID Mm kay But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that theres a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldnt have it UI This doesnt work UI So yeah function design UI Um you guys know me Pedro and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design UI If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good UI Um something cute and small UI The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties UI So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at UI And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people wont wont get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to for instance tune in their the stations UI Theres no need to have that in the remote UI So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo but um we should go for the useroriented device so simple controls and good ergonomics UI Um and uh although I th I th Im still here recommending the teletext so Ill remove that I guess but um we should go for the Yeah ID So I I still think if its cheap enough functionalitywise to include it really should be in there PM Mmhmm ID Because otherwise were just going to I mean even if its necessary or not if you if youre given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isnt more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it it can be operated with the same set of buttons yeah PM Right as far as i its just uh the cost of an extra button ID So it should be in there PM I mean softwarewise theres really no difference ID Yeah ID Okay PM I think ID Isnt Well maybe what were getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the TV for example ME I have maybe a silly question ME I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers theres gonna be the its gonna be outmoded teletext ME I I dont understand how those two things are connected ME How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ME I dont understand that ID So that might play on what we can do UI Yeah the theyre basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet PM Scheduling PM Um to find out what what youre watching even if theres commercials you know ME Okay UI But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities PM I think I ha I agree ME Yeah cause yeah I just I dont see the crossover between computers and television ME I mean I do see the crossover in some sense but but but but with the the remote is is used for television okay UI Yeah but its not happen yet PM Well for me Yeah UI Yeah ID Well you have digital TV still already ME So so if we make the crossover and were gonna view television on computers then were then were losing the the necessity of the remote PM Unless you have a Yeah ID Well there there is a for example on digital TV systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example ME S Okay PM Mmhmm ID A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can Yeah and theres other features for example on other systems where you can pause live TV and things like that ID Theyre just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the TV sort of under the covers but you still use it through a teletext ID So now the things to think here are that that theres gonna be more functionality potentially that we can handle ME Okay UI Yeah but we we dont were not aiming a command for that UI Thats the thing UI And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one so Well I dunno PM I think a lot of thats proprietary anyways PM Youre not gonna be able to you like command a TiVo with our remote ID Mm PM I dont think ID But still there theres an opportunity ID If if its for example a trainable one then were just simply having like an up down left right an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it ID Mm ID Okay UI One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or you know make two separate interface designs PM I think if its possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that PM Just you know Right its just not Yeah ME Yeah I dont I dont see the logic UI Yeah ME I I dont see the logic in elimination of teletext I just I I but Im not a techmind either UI Yeah ID Yeah and neither do I in fact ME I just dont see the crossover between computers and and and Cause we are designing something for a television okay ID Bu uh ID Ill communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that although teletext may become outdated w theres no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesnt affect the price UI Yeah ME We are selling it to an existing market UI Yeah ID Um but I I think what theyre pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to futureproof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe UI Yeah but were not putting some theres no no putting anything in in the place of teletext ID I dunno Im Mm kay ME Thats Yeah and and yeah and and were also marketing a product UI Thats the problem ME Its what Im seeing is a is a midrange cost product ME So so w we cant go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns ID Mm ID Yeah ME So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ID Hmm ID So if were keeping it basic were loo loo what were looking to sell it basically is its uh just being very easy to use looking exceptionally good that sort of thing ID Cause we really dont have anything else there do we UI Yeah ME I dont I dont see it and to me if Im gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design Im gonna Im gonna try to market it at a much higher price ME I need to make it special with a high price tag ME I dont want to make it economically uh g uh competitive ID Mmhmm ME I want I want to market it as exclusive ME So I would market this product it at eightynine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I dont think we have that flexibility ID But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic then twentyfive Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard TV so the place uh remote the then the place were going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant highpriced basic remote ID Does that make sense huh ME No I no I I understand what you say but what Im what Im okay we probably need to move along but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product and if Im coming in with a with with twentyfive Euros which is midmarket price um then what am I going to give these people for this ID Mm ID Yeah we probably should ID We were doing alright for time ID Yeah ME So thats just my question but we can keep talking ID Okay ID Sorry that kinda cut into you there PM Well Right UI No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands UI Um as for you know the the case design uh maybe Ill come up with more concrete ideas UI Right now its just the idea of simplicity and slickness cute and small um Yeah PM Im just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that where you know its just so confusing to do to use all these functions PM Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their TV remote they need another one thatll work with their TV PM They want something that looks nice that that that isnt gonna break when they drop it that you know that maybe its its ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that ID Mm PM I think thats gonna be where youre gonna find the biggest you know market share ID So we are looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features ID Is that Mm PM I think the more bells and whistles we add its just gonna cut into our into our profits PM Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that PM Maybe five percent you know and how much Right UI Yeah mm ID But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this PM Yeah okay ID Be a good idea PM Im sorry ID Uh sorry I didnt mean to cut in ME Yeah PM Sorry boss ID Im not the boss ID Okay ME Oh P Pedro I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles eh ME You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something thats uh um voiceactivated ME I know were getting into some I hope some big money on this thing but Is that for over here ID I think thats probably a question more for for this guy here yeah PM Yeah ME Okay alright PM Well its kinda both of us PM Us us user interface ID Is it ME Thats Cause uh and I think of voiceactivated I think of of how many times Ive Ive lost my my remote and I cant find it ID Okay UI Mmhmm ME So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this s just something PM Mmhmm PM I was thinking about that PM Then your lights would go off though ID Mm ME Im trying to find some bells and whistles cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext its like what are we gonna put in ME What makes this thing attractive ME And its only for televisions ME So we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use em for their VCRs their DVDs their their televisions and were coming out with one remote for television only ME And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I dont s I really have to say I dont see the market niche for this product PM Yeah ME At this price I dont see it yet ME Im I I go along with this because this is what were given to try to market but I I dont see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market ID Hmm UI But we th that should be design ME Yeah UI That should be the design basically PM Right UI I think technology wed we were not in the price range to do it UI We dont have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design ME Okay ME Have to do you have to do it in the box UI Yeah ME Okay well so so thats up to you then to to make this box in something thats absolutely extraordinary UI Yeah ID Okay ME Maybe make it in the form of a gun ME We can sell it in United States ID I have a question uh for you ID Does any of the um the features that Pedros spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ID In terms of making it work or the cost of that or Okay PM I dont I think all these things are pretty standard PM I think well be okay ID Kay ID Cheers ID Onto participant four ME Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do I go here ME Okay PM Mm you can just click ME Go go ME Is that right PM No no no you just get off that PM You just click anywhere ME Ahha ME Yeah what for me is it um I d I dont know what Im marketing right now okay til you spoke and when I wrote this I dont know what Im marketing ME I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer as a manufacturer and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers ME And so the th the twentyfive Euros that weve identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price UI Mmhmm ME Thats what we decided here ME Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself ME So what weve identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design ME Were making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is ME So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left ID Mmhmm ME Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily ME So I say inspiration so having something beauty something attractive uh something that in a sense will sell itself UI Mmhmm ME Uh innovation I think fits into what were talking about here with design ME Uh cutting edge technology I dont think were gonna have that these were ideas I was putting together um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned ME I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home ME I dont know ME These are just thoughts ME Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation that were new were aggressive were competitive were were trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line ME So to me its about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product ME Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive UI Mmhmm ME Uh were kind of in the middle of the market but what Im seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology but again because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations I dont know that we can bring any new technology into this thing ME If if we could have a technological something Mm p please PM I have an idea PM And its kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit into ergonomics and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote what we were saying its a common issue ID Mm PM Um what we can do is well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy ID Yeah PM Right PM And s for some people Yeah ME Solar PM Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ME But solar Blah I like it PM Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when youre not using it so youll always know where the remote is cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote and we can instead of having instead of having you know replaceable batteries well just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote PM You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries PM And also you can I I think its a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole PM You know you could have some kind of neat little you know a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself ME I like the idea but were talking about in cost is gonna probably double PM It w it would increase the cost ME But boy we can sell this thing because theres no batteries its environmentally sensitive i we can identify it as a safer product in some form PM And you could page the remote if you lose it PM Maybe theres a button on the cradle ME Yep thats right ME I really see But the cost i No no ID Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelvefifty per ME No no we have t we have to change the end cost ME Theres uh I mean I dont see it anyway ID We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelvefifty per product if we basically can sell more based on this ME Yeah thats gonna be up to these guys ME I my reaction is no but Well see I I see I Im an advocate to make this an exclusive product PM Well what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers ID Mmhmm ID Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if thats gonna be Nah I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext ME You know lets lets sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros sixty Euros ME Lets make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive uh hightech design uh ergonomics all of this ME Just make this thing uh yeah the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls PM I I Yeah ME Every homes got to have it ME If you dont have one hey what kind of remote do you have ME Oh youve got one of those oh fantastic I want one of those too ME I just dont have enough money right now PM I just dont know about that because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think wed need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate you know the DVD player and you know the stereo system and all that PM Which is a pretty basic function that w weve opted out of PM And additionally were m maybe not supporting teletext um But I do think there are some basic features that we dont have that a lot of other remotes are going to have ME Yep one one thing I dont understand is h theyve theyve given us this package okay ID Mmhmm ME Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back okay ME They say they say okay here you go ME They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want and and w its our place to kinda analyse and evaluate PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME I dont think its our place to create their product for them maybe it is ME I dont know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh but to me its like okay you have got your heres our ideas okay ID Mm ME And then let them look at those ideas and they say yeah well we can we can raise the price twenty percent you know we like this idea this idea no but to me its its about a choice do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ME beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that theyre handing f handing us right now ID Mm ME I dont see it PM I don I I d I have to disagree though PM I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh whove broken their remote and dont wanna send back to the manufacturer they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote and then theyre gonna look on the shelf and theyre gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote PM It does what they need PM These arent I I think that it Right ID And and th to get to back to another point sorry uh uh for cutting in but I th I think its important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple TVs yeah cause its selling on its own ID Its not going to be specifically for Hitachi TVs or or whatever ME Right PM Right ME No I understand that ID So technologically if I understand it uh TVs TV remotes working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes ID All you need to do is train them to the individual one all you need to do is is know the the f like some fourdigit code ID So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that itll work with DVDs and other things PM Mmhmm ME Nope theyve identified the product as not working for anything but televisions UI Yeah y y you you wouldnt The interface will be different ME Theyve identified this product limita Thats why I say I dont I dont see the market niche for this ID Oh okay okay ID We have done this ME If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs VCRs and everything then I can see the market niche but we were only identified as going for televisions without teletext ID I see ID Mmhmm ME And its like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something thats extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable because who wants just a television remote PM Right PM Well heres Right ID And I Id Mm sorry ME I dont PM We he well heres my thing about that PM If youre in the market for this ultimate remote youre not gonna go for just a television remote PM If it cant control if it cant control your your DVD player and a al if y if you cant get that allinone ultimate remote that just you can throw all your other remotes away ME Thats right PM Im not gonna buy a d seventyfive Euro remote ME I I I have a tendency to agree with you ME I really do ID So we really cant chase that ME Thats why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product ME I really question where we create the demand PM So I think what we So thats what Im saying Mmhmm ID Were really looking for something basic ID The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that were were carrying the corporate identity with the product but were actually looking for a large profit at the same time where Id be inclined to go back to upperlevel management and say like lets just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here ID Were selling more than just the product ID Were trying to get mindshare about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics ID We want people to eventually say oh thats thats Real Reaction thats a good m make ID Its reliable ID And and were gonna make it were gonna win mindshare by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working it just being good reasonablepriced and solid ID So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think thats in itself an extremely big thing PM I think thats big ME W okay if you if you drop the cost now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale and you make it less expensive then all of a sudden now were going into an a a new market area ME So we can say lowcost uh uh um uh good design beautiful wadadadadada UI Good design ID We only have a few minutes left ME But what Im saying is right now were middle market ID Is twentyfive Euros a midmarket price for a remote ME Yeah for for multi for a multifunction remote thats a midmarket price ID Okay PM I think so yeah ME In a discount right now you can buy em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen nineteen Euro and thats for the multifunctions uh DVD VCR uh catchalls ID Okay ME And and they have em in a little box in the middle and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls ME So to me to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness ME We have to have something that will change peoples thinking to identify this as advantageous and I dont know what that is ME Its gotta be lowcost or highcost with with special design features ID Well Id be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost then thats the way we really should play it PM Yeah ID If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twentyfive and make a low profitmargin on it but were really doing that to sell the brand ID Yep we have five minutes left ID Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions ME Or my d I mean I I well we g were talking about the other end now ID And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction PM What about um the idea that I had with the cradle PM How do you feel about that PM Or how does everybody feel ID Well how does everybody feel ID I I think The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think offhand as a as a consumer would I wanna buy that ME I like it ME I like the idea but we have t we have to find out Well PM No but I thats the thing I I dont think its necessarily the other end ID And I think maybe not because Ive got a remote and Ill take it to different chairs Ill take it to different I w I dont wanna go over somewhere and put it down PM Mmhmm ID It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair and that implies that theres only one TV user PM Right ID So its very good for some people but its not a like But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent PM Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power but when youre done with it you put it back in the cradle PM Yeah well it Mmhmm ID You have to l sort of remember ID You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and Yeah PM Mmhmm ID I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesnt seem like something that oh Id really want uh because of that fact ME Mm ID But I I dont know thats just my opinion ME Well I think again its it we have a cost issue here ME You know if were gonna go in this direction to me were going to the other side of the cost range ME Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high hightech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ID Mm ME Again I dont see our market niche in the middle for our product yet ME I dont see it yet ID Kay ID So what do we think maybe we should Pedro do you have any opinion on it UI Uh we should keep it simple mm mediumlow cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good ME W a question I have in in a cause I I I think I agree with you on we gotta make it a box ME The box is gonna sell it I think the outside the casing ID Really need to wrap up now ME Can can can we have multiple designs ME Have a modern have a traditional have a you know and so so instead of them all looking the same people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from ME I dont know what that creates cost or Yep one over another PM Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know ME Yeah okay I hear that PM So Um but what we could do is some kind of well I mean Yeah we we need to I mean have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is you know the best fit UI Yeah complicated but Yeah PM I think w whats really important is it has to look good it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand it has to be durable it has to a and I think its really important that it doesnt look cheap ID Yeah PM I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote PM Even though the cost may be low ME What ab what ab what about a a remote thats that doesnt maybe look like a remote ME Just an idea PM Mmhmm ME Just just okay cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside ME Theyre selling these things everywhere ME Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity is we make a remote that doesnt even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone PM Or what if it looks like a pen ME Doesnt matter yeah PM Yeah ME Im just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique PM A pointer ME It Thats the thing Im gonna keep thumping on PM Yeah ME Ill sell whatever you guys design ID Mm PM Yeah ME I dont have a problem selling a product thats not the issue ME I give you ideas you guys create the product ME Once you have the finished product Ill find a way to sell it ME Dont worry about it ME I just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings UI Okay PM So just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up PM Um I really un unless you guys are diehard against the fact that um its possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you cant lose it on your own I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle ID Yeah UI Okay UI Yeah PM Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just because I know at the end of when Im done watching TV that when Im done oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs PM Maybe th th th thats just some people that like that ID I mean theres al theres also remote controls I remember that that worked uh this hasnt been done in a while I think but th as a as a watch PM A lot of people As a watch ME No no ID Yeah there is remote control watches um but I think theyre a sorta eighties thing so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now PM Mm kay UI Yeah they are not simple ID Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know PM Mmhmm ME One thing I just thought about when you were saying that is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop PM Thats what I was saying ME Whos lost or broken their their remote ID Gotta cut up ME So how many remotes do they wanna buy ME Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one PM Exactly ID Mm UI Yeah ME And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something to to think about how have people been been losing or breaking their remote PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME How does this happen ID The last remote youll ever buy PM And also presumably theyve Exactly ME And and then and then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one youll ever need to buy ID Well if if were going down that then we can we dont need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make PM Yeah ID Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because thats just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there PM True PM Right PM Yeah PM The locatorll definitely be more expensive PM Mmhmm ID Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phonebased products uh checking quickly our Internet ID We really need to finish up here ME uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot ID But uh Yeah we have the the poweradaptor products ID We sell poweradaptor products ID So for example theres nothing stopping us using that technology ME Its uh just its that I think its telling us to stop our meeting ID Yeah ME So we have the c we probably have have online in our in our system we have the ability to create this were talking about ID Yeah I think so without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing thats already gonna be in place here ME A charging system PM Right ME If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics PM Right PM I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is never buy another battery ID Okay ID Yep PM You know something like that ID Kay ID Thanks guys UI Yep ME No thats not what I want I want Oh look it here,"The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor."
ID Afternoon guys ID Its gonna be ME Rock and roll ID Oh ID Kay ME So do we need to retrain Mike on how to put his mic on UI Think s Mm ID We may do ME Okay can he get it all by himself this time ID I dunno Im feeling like a big boy UI Pro Probably not cause hes S been listening to too much ME So I believe I can fly UI Hes getting retarded PM Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys UI Yay UI Or not PM Or not UI Yeah ME Just what I needed was something exciting ME Remember Im an old man ID Kay ready to go PM All ready ID Kay so weve got our conceptual design meeting UI Apparently Im old as well ID Hopefully weve all got exciting ideas now ME Thirtys really young eh PM We do ID Uh k exciting ideas ID Kay so heres our agenda our agenda ID Um Im gonna open ID Im gonna talk for a bit about what were gonna do ID Im gonna take some notes ID Were gonna all do a presentation and then hopefully were gonna make some decisions now ID Yep PM Alright ID Well when I say hopefully we have to ID So Im gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions ID And does anyone really want to go first PM I guess Ill go first ID You p two PM Yeah ID Whats Components design PM Component I think PM Yeah PM Yep thats it UI Presented by name PM My name is ME Jose he man is ID Your name is name PM My name is name ID Huh hi name UI My name is Inigo Montoya UI You killed my father PM Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush UI Prepare to die ME N name PM So so heres a look inside your really oldlooking remote control ID Right PM Um youve got a printed a printed uh circuit board here and youve got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate Yeah weve all broken a remote control ID Weve all broke a remote control ri um s yeah ME Ive I just love you tech guys huh PM So youve also got um youve got your chip here your batteries here and some sorta electronics PM Um Well so youve got heres heres a transistor and this amplifies your signal um youve got the LED here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board ME They just Yeah y do jabber UI Yeah theres a thingy and a dingy and Nah ID You press this and it does th I dunno who and whatnot PM Um youve got a couple diodes here for I dont know who and whatnot PM So exactly PM So um weve got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno ME P Yeah PM Uh its two double A batteries PM This is pretty standard remote PM So here are options for our power sources PM You can use a basic battery which weve already discussed um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that PM I dont know if thats really I dont know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it ID Kay UI I wanna change that ID Okay ME I I gotta I gotta flashlight and uh yeah but its interesting cause you shake it like this ME Like this PM Yeah PM So thats the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy so its like that flashlight where you have to shake it ME And thats on the camera ME Yeah ID Kay PM Uh weve got solar cells which I dont think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesnt make a lot of sense ID Mm kay PM And finally weve got our cradle o our power cradle idea ID Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here PM M battery versus cradle I think is yeah ID Okay UI I like the kinetic ID So we have battery versus cradle Its actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty just to be actually serious for a minute here you could Mm ME I g I I figured you would PM It could be fun ME Yes ME Yeah PM Yeah PM Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more ecofriendly than the than the cradle cause youre still using power off the grid with the cradle PM So um our case design ID Hmm PM We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do PM Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic a rubber latex type thing uh wood or titanium PM If we go with titanium were gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because its tough to shape the titanium and uh Yeah pers I think wood i I I cant see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote its just antitechnology really you know ID Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche wouldnt it ID Nah ME It it it Uh ID Okay ID Hmm ME Uh uh to me in a marketing sense its not its not relative ME We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it PM Right PM And what we may be able to do and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these ID Okay PM Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic ID Kay ID Do you get a good grip on the rubber PM Yeah um Yeah ID Yeah okay ME And if you make it from that super rubber when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand ME You dont even need to lean down to get it PM The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we well have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want PM So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um But basically these are curved and doublecurved I I believe that the tech department in their um in their message to me that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom ID Okay PM I have no idea exactly what theyre talking about but thats what they told me uncurved flat curved or doublecurved ID Okay PM I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a doublecurved where its curved on m m multiple axes right PM I think curved means just curved in one axis and doublecurved is curved in two axes or surfaces ID Okay PM I have no idea ID I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah thats what ME Mmhmm yeah thats yeah thats what I see PM Oh okay oh like a wave okay ME Yeah thats what I see also PM Alright that makes sense okay PM Um okay with the interface we have the following options we can u we can use push buttons we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button and LCD display or multiple scrolling wheels ME Ooh PM Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface ID Okay PM For electronics we have these very technical um descriptions here PM A simple chip which is the least expensive but I have no numbers to give you a regular chip which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh Yes the difference is with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesnt this scroll up ID D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip PM Previous previous okay PM A simple chip is required to operate push buttons PM Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the LCD display and it didnt say specifically but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels ID Okay ID Okay PM So but yeah ID Yeah that makes sense PM Thats the end of my presentation ID So presentation from I guess design would go best ID Next ID Technical functions or interface concept PM I think No UI Oh interface concept ID Yeah thats it UI Very long presentation ID Yes but it has your name on it UI Well that doesnt bo bode well for it for it tats as well UI Um so somehow that things too big but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition UI They say they could put it to work but um we dont think so UI No UI It it it youll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore and I think thats one of the things we wanna keep PM If the TV is working yeah PM Thats just I mean itll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show its gonna change the channel PM So Well then why dont you just press the up button ID But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ID So if you pressed it and went up UI That kinda would r d yeah ID Man yeah UI That would kind of lose it ID But if its just one thing with a button that you can just go Up ME Thats right PM Even still theres gonna be interf th theres there still will be interference from the TV PM It might not be it might not be completely confusing but I think youll still y its still I dont think its practical at all ID Yeah okay PM I think its a bad idea frankly UI Yeah so um taking that away our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable its the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls ID Okay ID You guys know your stuff UI Um as for the point that we making about losing it UI Well we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost about But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow well do that PM That I would believe ME Mmhmm ID Mm UI Somehow UI Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design so the numbers the volume control and channel control and teletext access UI Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial PM Mmhmm UI And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext ID So were suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume UI Ye no its not i i its just four buttons that are on a cross so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone PM Thats not a scroll wheel ID Nah ID Oh okay okay ID I see PM Right PM Instead of play stop rewind and fast forward there thats up down louder and quieter ID Uh okay ID Okay UI Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something midsized so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost UI That be it ID Kay ID So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching ME I dunno PM Trend watching has a later date there ME Trend watching I guess ME Trend watching I believe ID forty six nineteen fifty seven ME See what it looks like ID Yep ME Its been so long ME Well I dont know what to say ME When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I dont wanna buy it ME I see so many of em out there ME Theres nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there PM Are you talking about the picture ME Yeah yeah PM Thats not our thats not our b design thats just a thats just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like ME Okay ME Okay ME Okay cause cause right now I dont have too much to say about how to market this product because we dont have a product to market yet ME And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now ID Mm ME Thats what I understand so hello ID Upper management said yes ID Uh e excuse that thats a bit of spam ME And and so yeah Im a Im a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that Im gonna market ME Uh without special or increased marketable features I dont believe the product has a consumer demand ME Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now ME What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique PM Whats special and unique about a scroll ME Uh well I dont yeah its I I just see it as different ID Its cool ME I dont say its specially mm I dont say its special ME Uh I say that its different I what Im looking for as marketing is m give me something different ME I give me a lower price give me a higher price give me some new technology dont give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf its f at the same price ME I need something to market about this thing ME Were were a new firm ID Id Id say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though the then we have that as well but wi with a similar Mm ME What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give thats as as a marketing standard I need something to market to make this product unique PM Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior having it look really nice um and also be really durable ME Yep ME Mm kay ME Just remember when I made up this report I didnt have the information that were discussing here PM Right yeah ME And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design so what Im saying is from my perspective I dont have a product to market right now ID Course PM Yeah ME Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology ME Thats that is the next step theres technology and then there is technology which were moving into the next phase ID Yeah cause thats ME And so uh were gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability ME Yeah uh again Im not sold on the product because we dont have a product in my opinion yet ID Mm ME So I need a product ID Mm kay PM Well lets get a product then ME I need a product to market ME And I just whatever product you guys put together well find a way to market it ME Tha that Im not concerned with ID So now So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ME If you if you give me if you give me a cutout of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost ID Do we go basic or do we go for features ID Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that offhand first PM Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do PM Functionwise what does that do that Yeah ID Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ME Yeah wh wh whats the wh Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons PM Well its its just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do ID Mm kay UI But would we I dunno ME So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something thats unique ID Yeah ME If it creates something more complex or more expensive then I dont know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity ME But again from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because were were co its a very competitive market ID What I understand about scroll wheels is theyre theyre quite expensive to to make PM Yeah PM Th they are gonna be more expensive but on the other hand I mean it I mean it is an alternative if if you think thats gonna sell some some uh you know if if were gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe its worth it to do it but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down ID So I d Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it PM I dont think volume or do you think volume would be No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but Mmhmm UI Ill bet first in volume maybe UI I dunno ID We can target like environmentally friendly ideas that sorta things ME Mmhmm ID It s i m makes it easy to market its easy to differentiate the product yeah so ME Yeah yeah ME I think its thats right ME I think so ID And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole products gonna need to be more durable th thus because youre not going to be ditching it as often ID Its gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle ME Mm ID So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details but d do we have uh What type of casing ME Yep ME I think we got some exclusivity in that you know we got something that nobody else has right now and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create its own demand from its uniqueness PM Yeah ID I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber PM Mmhmm PM Im thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens you know where theres you have plastic bits and then its not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside ID Okay ID Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip sorta thing or for Okay PM Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration these pens I think are are kind of Or from from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all youre doing I mean its youre not gonna get any information back from the television so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and theres just not a lot of information you know there ID So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons or do we want if were ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go LCD ID Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it UI Its only a TV UI Hmm PM It receives no information ID Okay PM So I I dont see any reason for having an LCD cause its an increased cost PM Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it ME Yeah ME Yeah right now theres right now theres nothing coming out of the TV to receive so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something theres no s I dont see the I dont see the necessity of an LCD either PM Right ME Dont see it ID Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing ID So what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ID What what overall things have we not decided on PM Well we have to I think for me its still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be PM Theres the scroll wheel in or out PM What do you guys like in the user interface ID I think maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ME Again ME Well I think its its the more uniqueness you can bring to the product the easier it is I believe for me to market ME Uh again the pushbuttons I I see are are everywhere ME And so we can go with the same thing but were gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique ME You know the other thing I thought about was you know do we go to something like this ME Make a remote that doesnt look like a remote ME Its just another its just a an idea and I dont know I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is when you got children their their stuff gets inside the circuitry they get dirty they get messy with drinks and stuff PM Well I dunno about like the flipphone idea because I think as far as durability th its not a big well maybe when its closed PM Mmhmm ME This And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different PM Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost ID Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that youre being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ID Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost ME Oh okay phew PM Yeah ME I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness ME I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator I think those are two very strong features if thats something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost PM Well The The locators gonna require a radio transmitter which will Um were probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip s I would imagine ME Mmhmm ID Thats gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well UI No its just different PM But we I we will need a receiver an antenna ME Integrated yeah PM Yeah ME So its just uh I I think thats I know personally that would be a very attractive feature is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control PM It should be a really simple signal though so Thats true yeah ID And its presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep ID But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap its not gonna need q quality is it PM Oh yeah yeah ID Its Makes your living room more fresh as you watch PM Itll be really cheap ME Or maybe you can like have a a smellorama you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink ME You can Yeah yeah yeah yeah UI Maybe not ID Okay were doing well for time here UI S Yeah ID Um weve got about another ten minutes ID I think that uh Mm pr my personal preference is out PM So the scroll wheel in or out ID I dont think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that and I dont s think its obvious and natural how it would be used UI Yeah I think we have like and its not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing cause its it it breaks down easier ID Mm ME Yeah PM For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad PM I dont know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be but I think he does have a point i it might push somebody over the edge when theyre looking at our at our remote versus something else when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels PM I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that ID But then that that surely d depends a little on the TV because some TVs are quite slow at changing channels from like so if youve got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that youre actually keeping in pace with the TVs ability to to change channels ME W Yeah PM Sure ID Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ID You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to Mm PM Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this where its maybe you know a digital wheel right where its where its quantized into you know certain That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be ME Oh yeah ID Uh I see I see ID Thats where you Ah I see I see what youre talking about now ME Yeah ID Okay PM Its just its basically it its just a f look and feel thing PM It has the same exact functionality as two buttons ME I I think theres you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing ME Instead of going buttontobu you just j youd j j j j j j ID Yeah if youre just sitting there going Thats kinda cool actually PM Yeah ME I really I really think thats a really cool thing for surfing ID I like that PM Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid is a lot of TVs wont re the TVs wont respond exactly the same PM Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes and itll be like flip flip flip ME Well theres ano Thats right PM But Right ID Well not n necessarily ID You could basically make it so that itll I mean its just gonna be sending a signal to the TV yeah the TVs ge so if you send about five flip channels if you did that its gonna flip once ID If you do that PM Yeah it just might be frustrating where you cant make it go as fast as you want but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though ID Other than click click click ID Yeah ID And if were marketing it as a high niche product then were gonna be selling it to people who are buying good TVs as well yeah presumably UI Mmhmm ME Yeah I think so ID Primarily ME I I think so UI Yep ME Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it is that I I I see the dilemma ME But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct okay ID Mmhmm ME So I can go uh presuming I have on my television something that tells me what channel Im on I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two ME I know what because its on the television ME The television tells me what channel its on when I change it ME So I dont know that really thats thats gonna be a a d problem cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button ID Mmhmm ME Okay ME So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ME You understand what Im saying PM I think I know what you might be getting at or or Well what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels and it c it Why ID Oh I see so if maybe if we had an LCD up the top that just did a number on it right ME Oh no we could read it from the television ID And then it that basically Mm ID Well thats quite cool ID Youd need a display on the th the thing PM Itll tell you when you flip the channel on the TV ME Yeah the the television can tell you PM Yeah ME Can ID Oh yeah yeah no I see what youre talking about ID Yeah thats kinda cool ID How would you program it though PM Well you just its one extra button PM You say programme start and then type in cause you still have the typing you know youll still have the keypad where you can type em in manually ME Put And then ID Okay okay PM So programme start zero one enter zero five enter thirty eight enter programme end ID Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and itll go it sends out zero five and then thirty six and then zero one again PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Yeah thats kinda cool ID I like that ME And again we have another another great marketing tool ME We have about three we have three or four things here ID Thats not gonna be too expensive because thats gonna be youre gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really PM Mmhmm ID You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply ME I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as inhouse technology UI Yeah ME This may be something thats available through our own uh through our own services ID Might be but tha thats not gonna be such a costly feature ID The problem were gonna have is making it robust PM Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one up two ID Making it last ME Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one we go this way for the other ID So if theres a button for each type PM No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels ID Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta whether they do that or whether they Yeah yeah the mode switch ME Ahha okay ME Okay okay well then you just have you have a diff you have a mode switch PM Right PM I think well need a well need a mode switch but then if we have a mode switch were gonna need some kinda indicator to which an LE an LED okay ID Just the lights behind the buttons ID You could have backlit buttons maybe ID Would that work UI Yeah ID Is that okay we have five minutes PM Okay ID So right details th that weve talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel ID We want a mode indicator ID We want backlit buttons ID And if were making backlit buttons period do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button youre pressing at the time so that you know if its actually pressed or not ID Ive seen some remotes do that PM Okay PM Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the midmarket range PM It seems were kind of approaching a higherend range ME Yeah yeah ID I think we are yeah PM I wanna make sure everybodys okay with that ME Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this ID Yeah well we dont have its not that we have more money we can push up the the price ME Didnt you say so ME Thats what I mean ME We can increase the cost ID Yeah PM Okay ME So I dont know I dont know whether having Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say okay to create this product we see its gonna cost us this much for this volume because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit ID Kay PM I just wanna make sure everybodys on board with it PM So Right ID Yeah ID So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to though we havent got to a stage where were ready to pin down the price of components ID But Id say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that and what sorta price can we make it for ID Yeah no I I think thats where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting our management is really looking for us to push our brand ID Were entering a new market here so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to But th whats our ballpark as to what wed be able to sell something like this for ME Okay Im Im okay with that ME I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached and then we have to take this to the next level PM Well y yeah PM Lets lets try and think now how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store and you were in the market f to replace your TV remote how much would you pay for that ME We have to find cost ID But youve gotta think who our target market is because I Im not our target market PM Im just asking you ID Im a student but on the other hand I would think mm with my Project Manager salary I would think yeah I could probably afford this uh would I buy it PM If Then you could probably afford this ID Maybe ID If I had a cool new TV and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel which I thinks a really cool idea that would sell me on it a little ID Then maybe you know ID I do I dont think Id go over a hundred Euro certainly that would be way too much but the I would be happy paying over forty for it I guess but not much Kay PM Oh no no PM I would say thirty five to forty ME Yeah I was gonna say thirty five to fifty ID Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay PM Okay ID So the question is what we ca we make it for ME Because one of th one of the things were marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television PM Right ID Mm ME Its one of the marketing features in this ID Thats why the scroll needs to be really robust UI Okay so well come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber robust with scroll wheel with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff favourite channels and and with a cradle and yeah and the locator ME Mmhmm PM With a cradle radio transmitters and backlit buttons PM And its gonna look sexy UI Or not PM Or not PM It might look like clay UI Okay so you can market pe depending on that ME Yeah yeah ME Bas th thats thats easy ME Thats thats not a its a ME Cause we have about six six seven features in that alone ID Yep ME Under the title of uniquenesses UI Cool UI Hmm ID Okay ID The next meeting starts in thirty minutes although does it ID It starts at three twenty one the next meeting ID So weve got more than a thirty minutes ID Um weve got more like fifty ME Well I have Is my three twenty one is the next meeting ID The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah ME Thats thats almost uh fifty minutes ID Yeah that is ID Uh theyve theyve changed the times from the presentations ME You guys can You guys you guys can uh create a All kinds of things PM Probably PM Well let you know when were done if we can go earlier ME Thanks yeah ID Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this things gonna do look like how its gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail PM Yeah PM I dont think so PM If we have any questions well just email you I guess ID Okay UI Yeah I think it pretty much everythings covered ID Okay ID This one was quite easy UI Coulda been worse ME Still ID Always the optimist UI Yes I am ID Kay thanks guys ME Thank you ME I dont have any emails ME This means I can go home ME Oh we all leave,"The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. He discussed energy source and material options, and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option. He displayed the three options for chips. The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group, and the group decided to not use it in their design. He suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability. He discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface, and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost. The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive. The group had a discussion to decide on the product features. They decided to include a charging stand, to use a thin rubber casing material, to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability. The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype."
ID Uh kay ID So Yep ME So so so PM Put on your mic UI So you forgot how this works again PM Boss UI Boss ME Maybe ME Maybe maybe maybe ID Okay so were here to talk about the detailed design of the product kay PM Yep ID And heres the agenda for this meeting ID Uh Im just gonna open say a few boring words to start with again and start taking minutes afterwards ID You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there ID Looks cool ID And then were gonna evaluate it ID Then were gonna talk about finance and Ive got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this ME Bra Mm thats oh thats oh I like it ID And uh yep UI Hmm you knocked it up ID And were gonna evaluate the product and close ID Got forty minutes to do this in ID We should be fine ID Lets try and keep this one on schedule PM Alright ID So Your thing is in where is it UI Thi third third third ID Is it in Who wants it PM Three three UI The end product thingy UI Yeah PM Pedro can have it PM I like Ill help talk UI Um yeah so what we ended up with UI Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department which is us is uh fifteen point eight Euros someone forgot the units there yeah uh unit price unit production price cost thing PM Unit price UI Um we implemented the basic functions which is just TV functions plus the locator which was one of the marketing things cradle scroll wheel for uh the the channels and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping your favourite channels functionality in the scroll ID Zapping your favourite channels eh UI Yeah PM Scrolling through your favourites list ID Oh okay okay UI Zapping you know zapping ID Ah kay okay thats favourites UI Maybe its just a Portuguese thing UI And um yeah that was the result ID Ah kay ID I like the the the the logo on there as well PM Its very prominent ID It is very prominent ID So this is the Okay PM So here Ill give you the so this is the cradle unit and this is the actual remote itself PM Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here um and then the volume controls are here and here PM Uh youve got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten PM This is the power button PM Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here PM This is the teletext UI Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah PM The programme button yeah the programme button ID Ah okay I see PM So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use PM So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red area is like a rubber covering PM So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber so its pretty hard to actually damage it um Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem but if you drop it yeah ID Its pretty cool ID Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it UI Not helping ID Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it PM Yeah and it depends on if its sliding but I think its pretty ergonomic PM You can feel it ID Mm ID Feels good ID I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well PM Yeah of course PM Well this is clay ID Yeah its kinda cool ID You have to reach a little bit dont you PM Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach but I think we might scale down the final model a bit ID Ah yeah that wouldnt make sense PM These this is a bit larger than it would be but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability ID Its cool ID Im impressed UI Dont have no one to handle that ID And hold it so wh whats the marketing perspective ME I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for so Im happy because weve got some really marketable features in this ME Yeah I think its good ME Good good good job UI Yeah UI So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the wheres my remote PM Beep beep beep ME Uh pla Im ha Its great UI The locator function ID Okay ME Thats great ME Its a great feature PM Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up ID Mm its impressing ID So let me get it if I press this button I see ID Thats pretty cool UI Wicked isnt it ID Hang on ME So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and hell be across town Uh I can see that PM Beep beep beep okay ID I plan to do that as well PM Um no no no tha thats alri Exactly thats exactly what those are for ID So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ID Ah okay okay PM And um theres one other feature that we were debating but we decided to go against it is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it its it kinda feels like there should be something there but we couldnt figure out what button is important enough to put there ID Yeah its the right shape isnt it PM And we we dont wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm ID But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling cause then it would need to be hit on both sides PM Right PM So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit but Mmhmm ID Okay ID But its definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that hasnt it ME Yep I like ME Good job ID So is that the the final colour scheme as well or PM Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time ME No no ID Okay PM So well leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people ID The hmm PM Careful ID It came off ID The scroll wheels a problem with them not being sort of I dont think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore ME Well I mean of course I mean My my s my suggestion is were gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions ID Mm ME You know some blend of silvers and blacks PM Beep beep beep ID Okay enough of that ID Well i its cool guys ID Kay so are we done with the this presentation PM Yeah UI Ja ID Okay ID Now now ME So youre not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board ID Have you ID Okay ME Yeah yeah ME So No its not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldnt create it ID Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ID Oh I see I see ME I couldnt create it in the PowerPoint and I think Ive got this really strange cable ME So what I had basically going from the PowerPoint format is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot ME Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room UI Nah ME So what we had is we had the method ME Thats not how you spell method is it PM No way ME No A ME So this doesnt go so fast this way ME And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh ME And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market ME Weve got the features we have the uh characteristics and we have the I I dont know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate Help me ME The the corporation stands behind the product okay ME So the features I think we got the scroll weve got the uh the locator weve got the durability weve got the dependability weve got you know the features that make this a unique product UI It fell off PM Beep beep beep ME Um the characteristics I talk about we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics we have environmentally s sensitive ME Uh and the corporation were talking about were were a new were a new company ME Were wanting to make a name for ourself ME Were wanting you to uh find our product so were gonna give you a good product at a fair price ME One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product a normal use guarantee which means that this product for the for the life of of the life use if it should have a technical problem that we could re replace it at no cost ME That was something I would be interested in ME Um so yeah without uh going into great details we have a we have a product it has the features and the characteristics and the background I believe to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros ME Were gonna be competitive and were gonna were gonna have a market niche ME Um w That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation based on what our competition is I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense ID Do you would you a argue that that were better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could but lowering our profit margins ID Mmhmm ID Mm kay ME But Im sh Im sure open to to market this in either direction ME But you guys came up with a great product and at that cost I think it uh theres nobody else thats putting this this combination of of ingredients together ME The only limitations I see to this is that were focused on television only ME Uh thats the only thats the only drawback I see to this ME But with all of these other features I think people c one thing Im Im hoping for is people are not gonna even notice ME Theres gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesnt work for my DVD and my but I like these other things so they keep it they dont take it back ID And were actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway arent we ID Th theres no fundamentally different technology to do that ME Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ME You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone ID Hmm ME You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after Mmhmm but you follow what Im s Im s Yeah cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then were yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything but thats that was just an idea I had UI W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff but We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works PM Mmhmm UI But uh Very co very colf colourful ME Uh to me the only additions Yeah ID Yeah the plus theres the the risk of making it unusable as well or making it less b because at the moment its actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons you know what they do its very simple and it just works ME Yep ID Mm theres a risk of that ME But anyway thats uh Mmhmm ID Okay so we can talk about finance now ID So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros I was wondering how you came up with that figure PM Well that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units ID Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this PM Oh ID Now Ive made a f few assumptions here in that Im assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros equivalent to solar cells which I think is probably fair considering that we have inhouse manufacturing of power adaptors already PM Uhhuh PM Uhhuh ID Uh and Im assuming that the locator beacon the you know the Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an LC display uh an uh Uh do you think thats fair coming from a m the manufacturing PM Yeah UI beep beep beep PM Oh sorry PM Yeah um I do think we that we we uh dont need the events chip on print we only need the uh the regular chip on print so there may have been a m miscalculation in there ID Okay ID Yep ID Okay ID So were down to sixteen point four yeah PM And we and we have a singlecurved uh Uh I think that Its singlecurved yeah ID Is that a singlecurved rather than a doublecurved ID Were not entirely sure what singlecurve versus doublecur You think ME Weve got a weve got a curve and a droop ME I dont know whether that ID Okay Im convinced ID But we save one Euro that way yeah ID So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four PM See its a little bit more than f singlecurved PM So yeah its fifteen point eight thats where we came up with it ID Well hang on ID Do dont speak so its in here in that w do we have any we have special form dont we PM Okay UI Yeah PM Yeah we do ID So thats yeah PM Ah ID But the the the we havent talked about any special colour though uh I dont th if were going for greys and silvers then I dont think were O okay so were Pushbutton scroll wheel were basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll PM What do you know PM Oh its a thats not very special its pretty If th UI We dont Its a scroll PM Thats a scroll ID Just a scroll ID Its not one of the scrolls where for example with this one you could push it down to be a button PM Uh no we just use it as a scroll ME Ooh ID Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros PM It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say ID It wasnt bad UI Yes UI Were wicked PM Yeah UI Awesome ID Okay so were on to the Were on to the patontheback part of the presentation where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us and we can use that to tell Hows it going PM S s kind of s frighteningly accurate UI Yeah ID Anyone got any thoughts PM What ID How how have we done today PM I think we did pretty well UI Yeah ID I think we did pretty well too ID That looks pretty spectacular ME No I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept ID Any other chang uh thoughts ID Okay so th th what about um room for creativity UI That was mmhmm Yeah ID Is it the PM Sh I think there was plenty of room ID I I think we we ended up being quite creative there PM We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas ME Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right we raised the price of it weve added two t new technology to it ID Mm UI No PM Mmhmm UI Yeah ME So you know you know if this thing flies then weve weve adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us ID Not every idea necessarily its still a remote control UI Basically ME Yeah yeah yeah yeah ID Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess but the uh Kay leadership what do we report back to the bosses ME But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity cause w this is we did it ID No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing UI It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork PM Yep ID I agree ME Cohesive yeah ID Synergy ME Yes synergistic yeah PM There was a lot of synergy ID Teamwork yeah he is uh ME Yeah ID What did we think of the meeting room I guess is an important thing here PM These cables suck ID Mm ID Yeah this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Mmmm lapel UI Yeah PM Yep UI And thats D you must have very long shirts PM Yeah UI Thats way far down lapel mic ID Wha okay oh alright UI Lapel lapel lapel PM Lapel UI Thats almost a crotch mi cr Oh dear oh dear ID Thats its down its quite close ME You know you know what theyre gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta Oh ID Keep it keep it calm ID Oh dear ID No more pizza for me ID So yeah the the pen came in alright and its a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works UI Cause this is you were using it o upside down UI Still that Use them like that PM Thats our boss ID Nah Im Im not convinced of that at all ID Ive been wor Ive been wondering about that all day but see these look like theyre that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around but it feels more comfortable wh what you call upsidedown PM Pedros right PM Pedros right ID I dont care ID Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid ID What new ideas have we found PM Oh wel Well we had the favourites list and the scroll bar and we have the cradle and the r uh remote call feature ID Well lets do both then ID Uh for the product ID Yeah we came up with quite a bit UI Bunch of new ideas ID And for the meeting room Has anyone got any more Yeah less sore on the ears UI Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice ME Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables but Im sure that theres theres some justification for these things that I dont know about UI Mm ME And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon ME Its not been uh its not been cooperating so well but I dont think thats the thats avoidable UI Coulda been worse ID Okay so Are the costs within the budget UI Mm n no ME No ID Nope ID Oh hang on it really thats something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros ID No requirements are changed ID Were still under twenty Euros to build so were good ID And the costs within the budget ID Not the original budget but they are now ID Is the project evaluated ID Mm I think so yeah then celebration as it says UI Hooray ME Okay UI Free coke provided at the cafeteria PM All right ID Oh I dont know how that got there ID Uh anyway UI Who wrote that one ID Thank Thanks guys ME So we need to close this meeting yeah bravo ME Congratulations UI Cool PM Good job guys ME S Ive got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so lets close this and come back and kay ID Yeah Ive got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too ID Oh,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components. They demonstrated how the locator function operates. They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria. He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros. The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project. The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed many of the initial specifications. They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment. They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget."
ID So we can start ME Yeah ID Suppose I have to do my presentation UI Ah okay ID Eh um So Ill present myself Im Ada Longmund and as you may know it Im the pr project manager UI Its Ada Longmund ID So um we will have to um speak about m the project ID Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know theres lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control so the remote control has to be original trendy and um userfriendly ID Record ID So the project method is the following ID So if were um the functional design you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other ID Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design ID Uh ID The tool training is to try out the white board so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics ME Mmhmm UI Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard yeah ME So right now ID I dont know if we have to do it now maybe later later PM So yeah I think you can do it UI Yeah I dont know ID So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros PM Twenty five Euros ME Mm ID Yeah ID Yeah ID I think its quite good price yeah UI I its its reasonable s quite yeah ME Its reasonable I think yeah UI Twenty five ID And uh it will uh be a an international remote control as we want to sell it in the entire world and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes UI Is Yeah ID So as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control ID Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls try to create something new and people would like to to buy ID And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes so youll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do ID And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications UI I I hope so ID is for the Industrial Design yeah ME Those things just refer to each of each of us I think PM Yep ID Yeah ME AMI and okay ID ID yeah PM Yeah ID So So I will manage all all the group ME Okay UI And UID its for the User Interface Designer yeah PM Thats me ME Okay and Marketing Expert its me UI AMI yeah project UI you will be the manager yeah ME You can manage all this yeah PM Okay ME Good ID So you have questions ME Um ME Not really ID So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do PM Yeah ME So which you the Industrial Designer PM No Im user interf Im user interface design UI I am the Industrial Design yeah I am the Industrial Designer so ME Okay ID Mmhmm ID And you ID Mm okay PM Okay ME Yeah PM So whats the difference between user interface design d industrial design ID Hmm ME I mean you have to know ME Ah you have to know it UI Its difficult ME Its your job so I hope you you know what it is UI You know very soon PM Yeah I think so UI So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design it is how the object will look like ME Mm ID I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it PM Okay so I make uh u user interface ME Yeah PM You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it ID And i maybe you will transform it PM Make make yeah PM Maybe I think uh uh i industrial designs uh its the function design UI Yeah UI So the materi Okay right PM I design the user f user interface you design the function ID Maybe it is the outside and the inside PM Yeah ME Okay PM Okay UI But I was thinking that hes a user cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be you know PM Yeah yeah UI But I dont know UI Okay ME Well ME You know UI Im the industrial designer ME Oh okay okay ME Not the other one UI So PM Okay UI Okay UI So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay ME Yeah Im just go Im trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer ID And yeah ID And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product PM Okay ID So you dont have to do something really specific as everybody everybody will have to use it its sor the same as keyboards PM Mmhmm ME Mm PM Yeah ID You know you have Qwerty Azerty French and UK keyboard so really the remote control to be international PM Mm PM Yeah PM Okay ME Mmhmm ID And not too expensive PM Yeah PM And uh simple ID As we want to maximise the benefit PM And easy to use ME And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty so ID Yeah you have to keep in mind that the product cost wont be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros PM Ah yeah ME Thats the problem UI It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board I dont know PM Okay PM Okay ID And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that dont exist in the mm existing remote controls now PM Okay ID So is it okay ME Mm PM Yeah ME Its clear ME Yeah maybe should go and draw an animal UI Is it UI Are we supposed to do right now PM Yeah yeah you try PM Try first UI Oh right its its from the left to the ri Its I d I was thinking but I n Im not sure now ID So you think we have to do it now PM You can draw something which is very simple UI Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it so ID You want me to draw something ID Product manager okay lets go I will try PM Oh maybe we should bring Kemy here PM Kemy is really good at drawing ME Many Yeah UI Its not matter So PM Youre going to draw PM Okay ME Uh its the same as mine UI yeah UI Its a Its a cat PM Whats this PM Its a fat cat UI It is not a fat cat ME Its the fat cat okay UI Yeah it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat PM Can you draw uh um rabbit PM Oh hat ha rat ME A rat PM Yeah ME Thats difficult ID No ID A mouse is not too difficult UI Its your rat ID Mouse is okay PM Yeah its okay ME Yeah ME Just go you you the closest to the whiteboard UI Okay go right but in grow its everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea so Its a rabbit PM Mm ME Jus Yeah PM Okay PM Oh PM Okay I draw PM The only thing I can draw is like this PM Oh PM Oh PM Oh ME A duck PM No PM Whats this ID You love the eyes ID Yeah that was the eyes PM Okay ID A clown ID Rabbit ME Pikachu ID Its a rabbit ME Oh yeah ME Bugs Bunny one ID Yeah PM Okay UI Its not so bad so PM The only thing I can draw because its very simple ME Okay ME I go ME What ME Oh ME So what else ME This was my favourite one but Right UI So you dont have a A fish ID Thank you ME A fish UI Thats a thats a fish UI Okay lets try to draw something ID You forgot the chips ME Oh yeah doesnt look so fine UI Have to be really careful ID Fish and chips ME Okay its your turn UI Ah its my turn PM Oh PM Okay be careful UI Okay UI So ID Of Oh PM No problem no problem UI Its ok So what can I draw some more UI No UI Mm Yeah its its a se its my priority this one UI Yeah ME Mm PM A person UI No UI Its a really crazy dog Okay PM Dog ID Oh yeah ME Good UI Transfer UI Its a dog in a village PM Okay UI So what are you sug going to do now ME I think its done ID Yeah I think yeah UI Its done ME Yeah PM Okay ID Just have to present project discuss a little bit about it PM So we have break UI Oh my God ME Oh we have twenty five minutes for the meeting ID Yeah ME Okay ID So if you have questions PM Oh PM Hmm ME Know what time is it ME No PM No ID Its okay UI Yeah its okay ID You know your job ID you know your job UI We have an idea yeah ID You know your job UI I have an idea of my job so yeah so ID Okay UI Yeah PM Okay ME Good,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals.
UI So I will open our functional design meeting ID Mmhmm UI So I will play role of the secretary UI As also Program Ma Manager UI So we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer User Interface Designer and um Whats your talk PM Industrial Design ID Marketing Expert ME Okay UI Marketing Experts ID Mm UI And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements the decision on the remote control functions and we will close the meetings after UI Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer ME Okay UI Um so youre participant two PM One one ME No no no UI No youre No Im participant one ME One PM Three three its three sorry ME I I think Im a UI Okay never mind ID Okay UI Kay did you save your presentation ME In one PM In one sorry ID Yeah UI Isnt that technical functions ID No sure PM So you didnt save it maybe ME Its mine ID Uh its David Jordan PM Alright so David Jordan UI Names Jordan ID Course UI So so Ill I let David Jordan do his presentation ME Mm yeah PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Okay ID No no ID Uh this one doesnt want to be moved I think UI Uh PM Too great for email then ME Okay so ME The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote TV control PM Yeah ME Uh I I will focus on user interface design ME Um so move to the next slide UI Mm ME As we know our remote c rem remote TV control its very has very soph sophisticated functions as we show from this picture ME Theres a lot of functions ME Over I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote TV control ME So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ME Um lets move to next slide ME Um ME Yeah ME So I so we want to design uh elegant easy to use inter interface ME A very good example is Google ME As we know uh Google its a very successful because his um powerful function but with very easy to use user interface ME Um so move to next s slide ME So my job is to uh design a Google TV controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface ME So Thats the end of the talk the end of the presentation UI So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful ME Uh With sophisticated functions but with very yeah powerful UI So powerful many functions and very easy to use ME Yes ME Yep ID So I dunno its maybe difficult to have both I mean the the one on the right doesnt look so simple and Yeah PM To merge the two system huh ME Yeah UI You mean this one ID Yeah UI Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control I suppose PM Mm yep PM But But this is Yeah ME But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it ID Yeah and then Yeah PM Yeah you maybe you have some international standards where you know if you can use one is the other are or almost the same so the sign UI Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that PM Yeah yeah PM For example I dunno here escape you know you have escape in computers you have so if you see escape you know that it should be the same ID Oh it should okay yeah PM So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international you know that So ID The user should know UI Yeah um such as maybe the Go on go back and So you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use PM Yeah PM So PM Yeah but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system alright ID Yeah thats gonna be the trick ME Yeah thats my job PM Thats your job It you Okay okay ME Thats my job ME Its not the easiest Ive got to ME Yep UI Okay ID Okay ME Powerful and easy to use ID So thats the point ME Yeah thats the point UI So next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things UI So you youre Um PM Participant two PM Yeah UI Okay PM The rationale must be design or So we can move to the next slide UI So Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer UI Okay PM As you all know you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control PM So the re basically the remote control will be you know infrared control so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device like for example this one I h Im holding in my hand and the TV UI Mmhmm PM So this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know so so for me I think that it is better its bet its better to control TV so you know so its it will be cheaper and it is less technology than you know For the cheap price we have for the cheap price we want to I think its cheaper than laser so ID Mm ID True UI So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology UI Yeah ID Okay UI Do y you know the requirements for the remote control UI Twelve nearly thirteen yeah ID What the cost is UI The cost Mmhmm PM Yeah I think for the cost we want for the cost we want its better to have uh uh Lets see ID Twelve twelve a half PM Yeah PM You can move to the next slide so PM So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just you know a bulb and an infrared bulb so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside ID That might just So PM You can go to the next slide UI Okay PM I have some kind of pictures you know here PM You have the b the bulb it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important so UI Yeah UI What is this PM This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device UI Okay PM Look PM But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and UI Okay PM So and the next slide it is the last one its So its I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know its easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you PM Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both but you know I at my side prefer a wireless UI Okay PM Okay so if you have some question I didnt answer ID Okay ID Whats the average price of this technology then PM Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost I dunno around eight Euros so PM Or at least you know the Youd yes you can ME So what the wireless remote control ME Theres a wire with remote control PM Its so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know put some energy inside so you can think about wireless or you know its its a question that we can raise so PM We can think that you know with the wire you know without a wire PM We can have both also ME Okay UI So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the TV wont be a good idea ME Okay ME Okay UI No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah but Yeah but as Industrial Designer do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ID But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I dont think the user would be ready to have a I dont think well yeah I dont think he would but in a sense The wire ME Wireless remote control PM Yeah but some pa I always want to have you know sometime I want to have wire because you know UI Im just asking you UI Do you think it will be cheaper PM Uh I dont think it will be too much ME Okay UI Could you answer please PM Have to think about the question you know cause its I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire its mm cheaper but you know the wireless its more practical so UI Okay UI Yeah but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordans problem ME Mmhmm UI As its yeah ID Yeah ID True PM Okay yeah UI I think its more your problem UI Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not ME Mmhmm ID Uh thats my job ID Thats the Now the Yeah UI Okay Im sorry UI So So just think of um the usability PM Yeah but it should be an agreement you know because even if you can think of the wireless it is its it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer but you know PM If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have if you want to use so it can be good to have a wireless it it is a question ME Okay PM Right so ME Design a wireless remote control UI Yeah UI Just think of the problem UI If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ME Yeah UI I think its would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television yeah ID Well thats actually one of the point yeah ID True ID This you will see in my presentation then UI So I will let you to do your presentation so ID Yeah PM Okay ID Which is participant four ID So just trying to answer all the questions if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh ID Weve made a study so could you go to next slide ID Sorry for the functional recurrence ID So thats the standard method for marketing okay ID We had one hundred subjects um we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire um and see what was okay or not for them PM Mmhmm ID Okay ID So then its some statistics about what we observed and what they answered ID Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly okay so thats Yeah the the look is is bad for them so uh its your job David maybe UI You mean the loo the look the outside PM The look how it look like UI Okay ID Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly ID So this is where we could have uh yeah good market I guess if people are ready to pay more PM Yeah ID So its its interesting information I think ID And then um yeah the remote controls like the one youve shown previously its not so doesnt fit the user requirements sometime because its too many buttons and so on ID So we should change this as well ID And uh users are actually zapping a lot so theyre using the device intensively thats something to take into account as well ID And um you know ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control ID And uh this is one of the main point for me ID But Ill come back to it later ID Kay ID Could you go next slide ID Uh so as you said uh remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room UI Mmhmm ID So this is from the experiments weve done so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user I think ID Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people ID And uh remote control are really bad for RSI problems for twenty six percent of the users UI What is RSI ID RSI is like when youre using the same um doing the same movement several times then you get injured PM Yeah UI Ah um okay ID Okay ID So those numbers are less important then the previous one but still it has to be taken to count ID So last slide ID Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs ID If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent okay PM Okay UI Mmhmm ID And definitely if it could have less buttons still maybe the same number of um functions but less buttons this would definitely be a good way of selling more ME Functions PM Okay ID Okay ID So Yeah remember the user is not happy to read the manual UI Mm okay UI And just to have uh an idea do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control you think its possible ME Yeah UI Sure ME Yeah I think possible UI Yeah ME Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button UI Yeah ME So lets you then you have less buttons UI Yeah but do you think it will be easy to use ME But Im not sure No you you can have a switch menu so you can well for example Yeah I think so UI Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know UI Yeah I think the Yeah but it has to be intuitive PM The manuals ID Its Yeah ME Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes ME Then for um you can have a switch menu so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions UI Yeah okay UI Okay but Yeah but Mmhmm ME Then you you put the switch button then it switch to another category of functions ME Yeah ME For example if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your TV and also you can control your uh recorder PM With a Look fancy ME So theres a different functions but i if you you theres a button you can switch between control TV and control your recorder ME So we can has less buttons ME But what Im not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy not funny PM This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people maybe the the marketing people ME Because different people have a different opinion about fancy ME You know ID Yeah this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step yeah ME Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples so PM I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah yeah maybe UI Yeah but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control ID Specially distribution yeah PM Yeah maybe UI If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more ID Uh Yeah but this is what we would ask to the users so ME Yeah personalised colour ME Because you know Yeah because maybe some people prefer a red remote control some people prefer black remote control UI Yeah it will cost little bit more PM Yeah yeah yeah UI And also f Yeah but as soon as you speak about options it means that the price increases and we dont really want the price to be too too high because we wanna be able to produce it ME Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options so user can select which colour they prefer so ID Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Yeah remember its twelve Euros UI So we want something fancy as uh previously said Florent something very easy to use powerful and also as uh its written here seventy five percent of users they zap lot so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot ME Mmhmm ID Hmm UI And they dont really want to zap between functions of their remote control they want to zap between channels on TV ME Mmhmm UI So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members PM Yeah PM Yeah hmm ME Yeah UI So is it okay for your presentation UI Nothing else to to add ID Yeah its done just yeah ID If we would if we could remember like not too many buttons and make it look fancy I think it would make it UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Mm so So I had some new information about the product requirements so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking in your designing of the remote control ID So UI So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we dont really want to use the teletext anymore as its something thats Its is uh No yeah because now everybody has internet at home so its better to use internet then teletext ME Mmhmm ID Lame or Mmhmm Yeah ME Mmhmm ME Yeah UI So you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control and also the remote control will only be used for television so for y for you your designing youre not you wont be uh you wont had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that PM Yep ME Control ME Mmhmm UI Its because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television for the recorder for the camcorder and all the others it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we cant do that ME Mm UI We really want to focus on the remote control for the television UI Is it okay ME Okay ME But theres balance between function and the cost UI So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it to have very powerful and easy ME Yeah ME Okay UI And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product such as the colour and s the slogan ME Mmhmm UI I mean thats uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s its our product ME Mmhm ID Mmhmm UI So you will have to use the colour of the product of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah ME Okay ME Okay PM So ID So has to be yellow PM Yellow UI As we say we put the fashion in electronics so it has to be a fashion remote control ME Okay UI Fancy fashion powerful easy to use ME Mmhmm UI Require lot of requirements but Yeah ME Yeah PM For cheap remote control yeah ME And cheap ME A low cost UI Yeah UI But uh thats your your job to find something mm matches PM Yeah PM Yeah cause what Im thinking is how will you will connect the TV to internet so PM This is Yeah but this this mean that your TV would be able to you know connect to internet you know surf the web ID I dont think its part of the remote control design anyway UI Maybe not but mayb So ID Its maybe more in browsing ME Yeah theres that box in uh o of it ID Yeah ME A pi Theres that box in the TV so with the set box you you can connect internet with your TV PM Okay ME Ok Its Its not so uh popular now ID Hmmm PM Its pop I dont think its popular so thats the problem so ME Mm PM You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage so if people dont have the technology ME Global okay ID Mmhmm UI So everybody is okay with the new requirements ME So I I so As as for the colour what what do you think UI I think it has to be yellow PM Yellow UI Yeah PM Do you think that people like the colour yellow ME Yellow ME TV remote control ID Min Yeah UI Maybe you can change the colour but the image of the society has to be recognised ME Okay ME Okay PM I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R UI Why you go It has to be fashion PM Or should be PM Yeah so PM Doesnt need to be completely yellow but just mm ME Okay UI So you have to Yeah UI It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society UI Just when you enter you say oh oh its real reaction UI Think its a re reaction remote control so ME Okay okay ME Okay UI And also it has to be attractive of course because if you want to sale to sell the remote control ME Mm UI Its okay ID Regarding the first line what So were just expecting no more use of the teletext UI Yeah ID And thats it UI Yeah PM But I dunno but why nobodys a threat to me ID Its already changed for Mmhmm UI I think it would be simpler UI Okay UI So I will close the meeting um just after that well have lunch break UI And you will have in thirty minutes individual work UI Uh Y you You will have as the ID I dont remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept PM Industrial Designer yeah ID Industrial Designer PM Component component yeah ME Okay UI And Florent to work my subject ID Yep UI And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach ID Okay UI Its okay ID Yeah UI I think the um session is closed PM Good UI And by the way Mister David Jordan please record your presentations in your own folder PM Okay Okay thats clear ME Okay UI Not in mine ME Okay UI Should be better,The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google. The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low. The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements. The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project. The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote.
ID So lets start our second me meeting on conceptual design ME Mmhmm ID So as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and well have to decide on the remote control concept and finally well close the decision PM Mmhmm ID So I will first uh What ME No y you do the minutes first or ME No ID I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first Mister David Jordan ME Okay UI Yep ID So well S technical accessoire UI Yeah UI No no no ID Interface UI Yeah ID This UI Mm UI So uh first I will present the concept of user interface UI Um theres three concepts in the user interface UI So first one its a Google controller UI The second is a fancy controller UI The last one is uh intelligent controller UI So there are three concepts in our controller UI Um n next I will explain one by one the first is Google controller UI Um so I want the controller to be easy to use but with sophisticated functions UI So its a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions UI Uh this is a first concept of our controller UI The second concept is a fancy controller um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute very very g um attractive ME Mm PM Mm PM A nice one UI Such like this there are several uh examples in the slides ID Im not sure the one in the middle is very attractive UI Yeah its very you know if youre Yeah ID Its very big yeah UI Its hard f i its easy for you to remember it UI Or to recognise it yeah ID Okay ID Yeah why not UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Well have big discussion I suppose after that so PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Mm UI So the last uh concept is intelligent UI We want uh we want our controller to be smart so maybe we should uh use um uh technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition PM Mmhmm ME Mm UI Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user ID Okay UI Okay ID Something else UI No UI There this is the three concepts of our controller PM Yeah ID I just have one question because for the intelligent controller you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition but as the um expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah so Y Uh I think some time its very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button ID Do you think they will be able to use gestures ID Because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe they will get injuries because of that PM Yeah ID or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five I think they will be bored after a while PM Maybe ID You dont think so ID Yeah sure UI For example if you cannot find your uh controller you can just uh just just uh speak something such as yeah one two ID I Thats true PM Oh yeah thats a good thats a good point so PM One and Yep ID Yeah but suppose you got a cold ID You have a mute remote controller UI Yeah ME Mm UI So you can use your gesture UI Thats no problem ME Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ID Broken arm UI For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very Yeah ME Okay ME Okay ID Yeah but suppose you have a family watching TV and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work ID Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ME But this this but this would never happen anyway UI Yeah they cannot speak at the same time ID Why ME Yeah Yeah but the Yeah but this Yeah ID If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh TV programme so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time so PM Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the Thats right UI Yeah its very interesting UI Yeah ME I dont think it Oh okay okay you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff ID Yeah but you have the remote control so maybe you can keep it f with you ID Youre not youre not obliged to share it ID Yeah we can yeah UI Yeah thats thats the advantage of intelligent controller UI Even you h you have the controller I can I can say channel three so its c come to channel three I dont have to Its advantage ME No PM Its its And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers eh ME No but this is disadvant disadvantage ID Yeah I think its a disadvantage ME Yeah ID Yeah but one other question ID How how much will it cost PM No more expensive maybe UI How much ID Yeah ID Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working UI No no we we d we we just are use um No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute we dont have to do some basic research on this field ME Uh if you if if you use the basic But its its changing how the remote control is gonna be built ID Some some efficient ID So you think it wont cost an Not a lot for us ID Or UI Yeah I think its uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition its very its uh yeah ID Yeah but uh uh Mmmm UI Its No its uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the The vocabulary is very small so thats not a problem ME Because then you need uh I mean this doesnt have uh the power to do recognition for example PM Well y y you have also the language problem you know when you Cause it it have to be universal so ID Yeah ID I agree with uh Yeah but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international remote control ME Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ID We need something that is international ID Suppose were we want to sell it in France UI Yeah ID The recognition system will be able to understand French ID If you want to go to England it will be able to understand English so UI Yeah UI Yeah the key the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that its it has some some um adaptation mechanism ME Yeah this could be downloaded by the web maybe or Yeah PM Yeah but you know PM The product The pro Its a very smart its a very smart controller maybe Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah UI Its Its it means when you when you sell this controller in China its can recognise Chinese UI Its r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French ID Mm okay UI Yeah its Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed ID And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control PM But Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world the same one ID Yeah but how will you Oh UI So Yeah UI Yeah ME Mm PM If you have the language you have to develop for each country UI Oh n Yeah yeah tha thats why we have to do language adaptation PM Yeah but for each country you have to do one because uh the for example for Se Oh really UI Yeah UI Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to No its not so complex PM Thats Comple A microphone maybe ME Yeah but then w Yeah we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem ID Seems to be quite complex ID And what about voice recognition do we have microphones ID And where will be they ID Do you think if were far from television it will work UI No no no its not I think thats n thats not a problem because you you dont have to wear a microphone UI It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller ID Yeah but where is the controller ME Okay UI Where is the controller ID Yeah UI Its in your family in your home ME No but then its its like this uh Yeah ID Yeah but were here its uh an object ID But here you say you want to use i uh s technology UI Yeah UI Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here ID Yeah but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this if you have an object ID If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free without any object PM To talk to the to the TV maybe ID You just want to interact with television UI Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here then you you use your command and you do s your gesture PM I if you say one he switch to channel yeah ID Yeah but you can lose it UI No no its n y if you lose it Yeah PM So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the TV to switch to channel one ID Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on TV and just to recognize gestures and voice PM Devic Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control UI Yeah ID Ah ME But you would still have the buttons ME Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ME Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons UI I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah ME Okay so you yeah ID Yeah but Mm UI You can see they can switch form one modality to another ME Yeah I dunno ME Its a bit risky risky PM Yeah ID I think so UI No thats quite inter quite attractive ID And maybe it will be quite Okay PM But I think that you know switching from one country to to another will be a problem so although y y Yeah but i i Yeah we should UI Well if you do language adaptation there should be no problem ME Yeah I dunno UI We should have confidence in technology PM Uh ID Hmm ID So what do you think ID Well try the controllers youd prefer PM Mm ME What ID Which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user ME If if I mean uh Im sure if the user pays the same price hes happy to have recognition UI More features yeah ME But if if if it like doubles uh no one would would be interested PM Yeah but I think he need a control that is very reliable so ID So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller ID Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ID Hmm PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller easy to use sophisticated and fancy UI Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts ID You think its possible UI So whats the difference between our controller with other products in the market UI Theres no k features of our controller so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ME Yeah PM Yeah ME No I mean Y No but you need you need new remote controller then UI Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Yeah you y thats a fun thats not the function of the controller thats a function of TV PM Its not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet so or something like that PM But uh I think a user need Dont have a the the Yeah if we can send email from it UI You can replace your TV with a new TV with internet browsing function but Okay ME Because if you wanna browse internet or I dont know if you wanna type something or No UI But its not the only the problem only the issue of controller its its also the issue of the TV ME No PM Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if Yeah And for all the person of the family maybe so yeah ME Cause for example yeah UI Yeah but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it your mobile but you when you choose a new mobile you choose the one with voice recognition ME Yeah ID Yeah but uh we want so Yeah but w we we want something th that works all the time every day every hour for everyone ME Yeah you wou you would True UI Thats the feature is not one hundred percent reliable but its a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products UI Yeah UI Yeah uh Yeah if if if if youre if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable would you replace it with another one ID You dont need to tune it ID Yeah why not ME I mean for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Googlelike controller ID If its Not too expensive too PM Because you have new Ye Okay UI Yeah UI Yeah ME I dont see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google ME Google is is simple works fine so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic simple and works fine its already a lot UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Oh yes but theres no big difference between the traditional controller ME Uh thi this I mean the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy looks nice and its easy easy to use easy to use UI The then nn no UI Tha But the theres theres n theres n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if theres no key feature in the new controller ME See Thats the problem yeah UI Thats the same yeah ME I mean I I know its more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever UI Yeah ME But you have to think the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so UI Yeah ID Okay ME I mean thats the point ID So lets go to the Industrial Designer UI Okay ID Maybe well be able to take a decision after that so PM Okay UI Yeah ID Two PM Yeah participant two um Yeah working design so ID Working PM So I think Can you go to the next one ID I can Okay PM I uh its not this one PM Its uh oth the oth so I Its the working design PM Sorry PM Component design ID Its okay Uh I think theres something wrong with your Maybe you you record it somewhere else PM So this yeah so this is the described use What PM Are you inst I dont think so UI It did didnt r receive it UI Didnt receive it UI Participant one UI Participant one ID Interface concept ID No ME Hmm ID Mm mm PM Oh PM Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer ME Yeah ID Uh ME Dunno ID Nope PM Okay okay PM Yes ID It seems that we have a problem with the Yeah so No I think it will be more interesting to start with uh Yeah ME I dunno if you remember what you had to say or I think its more interesting what he says okay PM I can say it to you without UI Yeah maybe we can first come to uh to Frahan UI With Frahan then you can prepare your slides then present it later PM Yeah exac Okay ID You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Babas presentation PM Yeah ME Yeah true PM Yeah UI Okay PM In fact I dont know I s because i in my presentation I dont have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control ID So ID Okay ID Okay never mind UI Okay UI Okay PM So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so UI Okay PM So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one ID Mmhmm PM So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button so it can be some you know classic pushbutton like this one or you have also some button like LCD where you know the button the buttons are unlighted during the night or you know you can see them in the darkness ID Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Okay UI Okay PM And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation electric alimentation do you want to have so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so UI Uhhuh PM And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from you know the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation you just when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it for example UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Yeah I think its an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price of production more no PM Yeah PM Yeah yeah mm PM Ecologists yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah PM Alrigh In fact having them both will if we want to have battery regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be itll it will add a little bit of the price but it will be an added value also that will be compensated so hmm ID So ME Yeah ID Okay ID And what tha what about the uh materials PM And the materials it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common its very resistant but you know something wooden will be like I dont know high cl so a special high class or you know you can have some Yeah even if it is not completely wood but just a part of the you know will be wooden in wood and it can be interesting ID Impersonal mmhmm ID Yeah ME Special for Mmhmm ID Yeah and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Mm ID Mm okay seems to be interesting mm PM And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits chips or do you have low level or or very very expensive it depends but I think that low level will be you know it is an interim module ID Yeah we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah yeah ID And you think that we will be Okay PM Yeah I think it will fit on the price we want twel twelve Euros so ID So wood ID And what about the buttons PM I think the buttons I pr I prefer you know the LCD you know lighted buttons because you know its I dont know um yeah in the dark its fashion and its related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch TV in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost you know in the darkness its very easy so right ID No its fashion yeah ME What about the touch scr touch screen ME For example ME Its its expensive I I guess PM I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the LCD buttons so ME Mm PM But And it is a kind of other design I mean PM It can also be interesting to have this kind of Mm ME Yeah UI So you got email ID I dunno ID I think we have only uh five minutes left ME Okay ID Participant four ID Functional requirements ME Uh no trend watching ME The other one ID This one ME Yeah ME Uh I think so just Yeah so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of whats the fashion in general Ive checked more than only the remote control market so next ME So again its pretty much similar to what Ive said in the previous meeting ME Um user really really want a fancy look and feel ME Theyre not so so interested in uh functional look and feel okay ME Like the one youve shown David with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but its its not what they want and uh So second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative so maybe its sort of related to what youve said with the speech recognition and so on UI Mm ID Okay ME At the same time its important that its easy to use ME So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis ME Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay ME Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables okay so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing PM Ah yes PM Yeah yeah PM Okay yeah ME Cause its its really what people want ME Even if its in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control ME And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points fancy look and feel has on a score of seven would have six as importance ME Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative its three ME Then easy to use uh its not so important actually with respect to other y other ones PM Okay ME So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables PM And fruit and vegetables yeah ME And the other point I havent mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch okay so this is this maybe doesnt really fit with the wooden design PM Spongy Kay PM Okay yeah yeah ME I dunno PM Yeah but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ME Yeah thi this is this would be like um plasticlike but rubber mayb maybe you know rubberlike uh device so um Okay tha tha that was the main point I think from the trend in fashion PM Pla S Very stuff Okay rubber rubber desi okay yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Okay ID So we have to take decisions about the component concepts about the energy ID So as you say you want something technologically innovative maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting maybe will attract proecology consumers PM Yeah PM Solar ME Yeah so when I think its Mmhmm PM Okay PM Yeah PM It will be a Yeah ID Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well PM Yeah I think Yeah yeah PM Yeah ID Case UI Later ID So you think case ID Something spongy ID Someth no wood PM No wood but Plastic ME Maybe not no wood but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know PM Would some I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and you know UI Pla Uh yes ID Maybe you Its its natural ME Yeah maybe the base PM It depends on the design we want so ME But still y Yeah PM Yeah its natural and i And it can be correlated to energy solar energy so for the marketing aspect you know saying that its ecol Mm yeah its not right so ID Th The feeling is natural so maybe we can stay with wood ME Yeah I mean its not exactly right for the spongy point of view ID But its still fashion ME But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons or I dunno PM Okay ID Yeah something that you can into it ME Yeah ID Uh and what about the user interface concept PM Google and and fancy f how about the the voice ID Google and fancy ID Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this PM And Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if theyre interested and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI The smart controller PM Mm PM Yeah PM But and the problem is I Im we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the TV so speak directly to the TV and you dont need a remote control actually so ID Yeah but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice PM But it will be embedded on the TV and not on the remote control so ID Thats true ME Yeah d I dunno UI Okay ID So maybe well just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller maybe try to mix them these two concepts together just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood UI Mm UI Yeah UI Its good ID And LCD buttons PM Yeah LCD ID Yeah I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add PM Yeah yeah yeah PM And pf what can we think a supplement to I think the supplement can be the voice ME What interface ID Yeah for the interface something added value PM It is just you know it is not the most important but it can be a part of Yeah yeah ID With a module ID You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands words and use them when you dont want to use your fingers PM Yeah PM Mm UI Mmhmm PM To push button yeah yeah PM Even it is for s just some kids you know switching channels one two three four ID Turning the TV o on o or off PM Yeah turning yeah yeah PM Not very complex commands but easy commands so ID So adding some vocal commands PM Yeah ID Simple ones PM Yeah simple ones for expensive buttons Yeah to make some new Yeah ID Okay ID So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so well you will all have to work in in your direction ID So you will have to work on the look and feel design to have the easy to use powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition UI Yeah UI Yep UI Yeah ID Uh you will have to work more Baba on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control ID And I sup I think well have to evaluate th the product too ME Yeah no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends ID Yeah PM Okay fruits ID Yeah ME If possible PM Okay ID And remember as as I said last meeting we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control PM Need it to be okay ID So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control so you will have to model model something UI Yeah UI Okay PM Okay UI Yep Okay ID And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach PM Okay ID So no more questions we can close the session ME Hmm PM Sounds good mmhmm ME Okay ID Yeah UI Okay ID Okay cool,"The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote. The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length. The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, introduced the option of using a solar battery, and discussed options for buttons. The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports. The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept."
PM Mmhmm PM So ready ME No not really UI Kay ME Just Crap PM Sorry I I um Im afraid Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype ME Okay UI Its perfect ID Your judgement its is biased ME Kay so whe where is the remote control ID So we are So lets go for our detailed design meeting UI Where UI Its here PM Okay ME Yep ID So I will still play the role of the secretary and well have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer David Jordan and our Industrial Designer Baba UI Okay UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Kay ID So well have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost ID And in case if were we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control well evaluate the um production ID So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh sorry UI I have slides PM Okay ID Oops UI Ah that is three PM Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything UI Product prod Yep ME What slides UI Okay UI Okay UI So this is our product or prototype UI This is made by clay ID Looks strange UI Yeah UI Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red UI Yellow is uh our company colour uh red its uh is more attractive ID Okay UI So we used two basic colour yellow and red UI And the shape theres two basic shape UI The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece UI Its we call it a mushroom design PM Okay UI Its looks like some mushroom so we call it mushroom design PM Yeah PM Uh Yeah yeah Im sure UI So this is a introduction of our product UI Next a mo Okay yeah so next slide ID Genetically modified mushroom I will say but keep on speaking ME Yeah UI So there are several key features of our pr prototype UI The first is that it is fuzzy UI Im sure this would be the unique design the market ID Oh ID Maybe I hope so UI Yeah so its a fuzzy design and a unique design PM Yeah thats true UI Um and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection UI In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle so we can turn this ball to t to select channel UI So its quite convenient for user to use it ID Chan Yeah okay but dont touch dont destroy your prototype UI Yeah s okay UI Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base UI Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable so uh so its its um its unlikely you cannot found it UI So its v Um you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and theres some cute button UI You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom so Yeah everythings mushroom ID Everythings mushroom PM Yeah ID So we can call our remote control the mushroom UI Mush Mushroom design yeah PM Yeah but its not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape you know centre is yellow and t d To integrate you know yeah UI Yeah ID Okay UI Yeah th thats why if you put it in the table be careful somebody will eat it PM I dont think I hope nobody will eat it PM You know to integrate the fruit aspect you know the the in Really UI Yeah ID Oh ME Yeah because mushroom was not in the trends ME I mean there was fruits yeah ID Fruits and vegetables PM But Fruit and vegetable so mushroom was a kind of you know uh Mushroom ID Vegetables ME Yeah ID Mushroom is a vegetable ME I dont think it is UI Yeah ID Its vegetable UI Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Oh uh Im not sure ID So th its something eatable PM We can its a veg a kind of vegetable but you know we we integrated them with different colour ME Yeah UI Yeah ME But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so its fine UI Yeah PM I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know PM This you know very enlighted colours you know ME No I mean yeah yeah ME Inspira inspiration is True PM And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material so UI Yeah PM And so So what we w what I can add is that you know he talk about what is outside so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about you know the chip it is a low level chip and You know we dont need to k ID Next slide UI Uh no this our only two slides UI Yeah UI So we cut it to see ID Mmhmm PM You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the LCD button and the i The battery it is under UI Okay UI So wheres the battery battery PM It is in th in in the base yeah ID In the base UI Base ID In the basement UI Here ID In the basement ID And where is the solar solar cell ME But we say uh we sa we said solar ID Where is the solar cell PM In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I dont think so but it its might be okay so ID Oh ID Do you think it wont be It wont cris increase the price UI Okay ID Okay well see after ID We will have first to so mister money whats your opinion according to this remote control PM I it might be okay UI Okay PM So Yeah ME Yeah ME I mean we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design and first one was uh fancy look and feel ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ME So w well try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale one being uh no I think ME Uh just let me check PM So four point three point five it means its acceptable ME One one being true and seven being false ME Okay PM Oops ME Ouch ME So Do we have a fancy look and feel according to you UI Okay UI Yeah I think so PM I think you have nice colours PM I dont The sha the bowl shape people like ME But is it Uh Ill agree its unique but is it really Yeah I mean fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look UI Yeah the shape is unique and the colour So it depend on how d do you define fancy PM Is it really fancy PM But its you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing ME Yeah ID Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out and maybe do things like that It would be bet more like a lemon PM Do Dont do that please ME I dunno where the lemon is but I mean its not obvious PM I its its i this shape is a lemon like so Yeah ME If I dunno maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah PM Because i Less button ID Yeah UI Uh so my mush ID Looks like more fruit PM Yeah but you dont have any button now UI Mm ID Maybe a pineapple ME I dunno ID And you know you have the finger here with the buttons UI Yeah UI Hmm PM Thats uh yeah is that thats a good idea ME Yeah its getting Okay PM So thats great ID It looks more like a pineapple PM Thats great ID Sorry ID Whats the use for that UI Uh for turn turn the ball PM I have no idea so UI If you want to turn the ball its very its very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel PM I have no idea what If it is fancy or not ID And where is the voice recognition UI Uh UI Ah its embedded your microphone ME Yeah thats Wait th thats the second point ID Okay UI Th this th th theres two two functions UI This is microphone array Okay ME First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel ID Okay ID Is it better like that ME I mean No the colour is okay thats fine PM So we can we can say t The colour is the colour acceptable ID Looks okay lets say its a pineapple now PM So the shape now ME I mean its but I would say there is more too much red ID It looks like a now you took it PM Its too much red ME Um if Right PM In the basement ID It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top ME So from one to seven ID Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum PM I will give I will Ill gi Ill give two or three ME No seven is false and one is true PM Three its okay ID Three I will say three PM Three three ME Three PM Three is fine for me ME Okay UI Kay ME Three ID Isnt it bitter like that UI Yeah yeah yeah ME Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative PM What other Is it easy to use ID Feasible PM Ye uh Embedded ID You said previously that you theres um microphone inside an Oh UI Yeah this is microphone array in fact PM Its a micro array okay UI There four microphone ID Okay and you have the theres the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments UI So they they they they theres a microphone array UI Yeah yeah UI So you can capture voice yeah you c Yeah so you can capture s voice from different directions ID And you can turn it so maybe its techno technologically innov innovative PM Oh yeah yeah PM And I think you youve never seen a rou a round remote control so it is I W Yeah but I see you have microphone array embedded ME Yeah bu but when you say technologically its more uh I dunno in the core or single UI Yeah ID We have tactile buttons ME Mmhmm PM You have Thats good ME No thats good ME Yeah PM And you have you know this ki this solar receptor that you know Yes ID Oh yeah ME Yeah th thats another really good point PM Yeah ME Maybe okay PM I think technically its acceptable so Yeah ID Maybe two ME So using the same scale two ID Two PM Two yeah two ID I would say two PM Its its fine so ID You agree ME Okay UI Yeah I agree ID Its better like that isnt it ME Now maybe the most critical one ID Okay PM Most Eh for th the vocal command yes its might be easy ME L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use PM But its just speaking UI Yeah its very easy PM You just need the command ME Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please UI You can use this in this way PM As a principle UI Yeah UI Th this is the base ME Yeah UI So you can turn to change the channel ME Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels UI You just tu turn d d Yeah PM I think maybe if you he If you hear some click Yeah it would Oh yeah thats difficult ME Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah Im Im no Im not definitely convinced its its the best way to if you wanna jump from I dunno one to twenty ID Oh ok I understand ID You take take the remote so and you can turn like that to change the channel UI Yeah ID I think its quite easy to so s zapping but maybe it will be too fast UI Yeah ME How can you go directly to twenty for example PM Thats dif thats difficult UI No no no UI I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one ME Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah but y how you need to know I I think something that Yeah ME I agree ME I agree ME But I mean if youre fro from two UI So it c it could be channel two channel three channel four channel five ID Yeah you have a like that and so on UI So change UI Yeah PM And you you can I think you can if you have a scale so Yeah its a bit difficult ME Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh Were not talking Yeah ID Oh yeah UI Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree UI So you got how many degree you you it No no you dont have to y no its uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop the the turn then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you Its its very easy because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Yeah yeah yeah ID Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go Mmhmm ME Yeah ME How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ME So you you count one degree two degrees no UI You can do it ME I dont think so UI I think so I think so you can do it UI I think so you can just change PM I think b but the the vocal command is easy too PM You can say fifty and fifty its okay so Uh yeah and y thats yeah ME Yeah voc vocal command is okay ME But w weve said previously that maybe its not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing ah UI Theres uh also a number you know ID Yeah but when youre zapping youre changing from one channel to the other so youre passing through all the channels ID So when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty thats youve decided to go to channel twenty so you can say channel twenty or channel four because you really want to go on this channel ID But if you really want to to do zapping you you dont really know what you want to do you can turn it ME Yeah PM Yeah ID Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting PM To see uh yeah uh Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Seems to be good UI Yeah ID Good choice mister David Jordan UI Yeah ME Yeah I mean youre famous PM And but Id It is a turn off t turn off button maybe UI And also you can if you i You ca you can turn this ME You ID yeah whats whats this cherry UI Or you ca you can you can also turn this UI For this you can tune its for tune UI You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two you you skip this UI If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this ME Mm UI Its like fine from coarse to fine UI This is coarse this is fine PM Yeah yeah yeah PM Thats thats very technologic so ID Okay UI So its coarse to fine design PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Okay the uh th this looks better ME Yeah UI Yeah is is this is from one channel to maybe to ten channel PM S But I di I didnt see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the Uh its k on off yeah UI This is from one channel to Yeah ID Yeah th you have the vocal commands UI Yeah UI Yeah ID On off ME Yeah but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah thats not the ecological part yeah ID Most of the time you have the yeah its a sleeping remote control PM Yeah sleeping ID Thats true ID W that why we have the solar ti yeah ME Solar PM To compensate PM Yeah UI Okay ID So three ME So which number PM Easy to use its very relative but three its fine I think its reasonable three UI Mmhmm ID Do you agree UI Yeah agree agree ID Three ME So reasonably is four is one PM Three f three for me its o its okay ME So three PM Four or three PM Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean ID And whats your opinion ME Uh we wouldnt say I mean those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me PM Will you give four PM Five ME Id like I mean this is the just a prototype ME Im not really convinced its so easy to use but I dont know PM Yeah so maybe if Yeah but y you know You just push two button zero and and one UI Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ME Yeah UI I think its easier than traditional controller UI If you use traditional controller you have to put a button but now you dont have to put button you have you just turn the turn the ball UI Theres two kind of balls the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale ME So you have yeah UI But in the traditional controller how do how can you control the scale ME Uh by pushing zero after after the first one UI Yeah yeah yeah y you you can do it but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p theres also a button here PM And thats Are there some buttons ME Yeah PM Okay UI Yeah this function is just for your browsing from one channel to th the next one the next s sn s the th the third one ME Mmhmm ID Its not what you said previously ID Previously you said that turning this was the fine Fine to coarse ME Yeah if youre changing your mind ME Fine to coarse UI Yeah yeah ID And from ten to ten channels here UI Y one to ten ten to twelve uh ten to t uh twenty UI Ten to twenty and this one t one two three four five six like this ID Okay UI Uh theres different scale so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Mmhmm ME Okay ME But this this has to stay on the table right ME This has to stay on the table UI I i this is just a base PM In fact on a flat place You can Oh ye yes thats right UI You can just Yeah ME Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just Its Yeah ID Oh Yeah no no no ID You cant put it out ID Its just your turning from the base ID You need to have everything in hand ID If you want to turn you cant use it and turn ID Its impossible ID You need to put it on and turn ME You know tha thats the weak point because with a traditional one you just have one hand PM Oh my God UI You use your y So th this is a d next generation controller ID Yeah but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say Ive lost the remote control ID Nobody would take it ME Sure ME Yeah you would never you would never lose this one yeah ID So nobody w will lost lose it PM yeah maybe maybe may its the next prototype maybe we cou Four ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Okay okay okay ID S maybe we can change from th Four PM Maybe four its okay UI Four UI Okay PM Ill put four ID Easy to use four ID Gonna say four ME Four PM Yeah four its more reasonable ME Uh its even easier to maybe PM You can you can erase with this er yeah ME Ok Mm UI Okay PM Yeah four its more reasonable so PM So its nine nine over three ME So average ME Three UI Three ID Trois ID Three PM Oh yeah its UI Trois ME Okay so Yeah especially on the easy to use target PM It need maybe some wo further work but its Yeah uh s yeah UI Yeah PM Might it might be fine ID So th the project is accepted ME Okay UI Yeah PM Yeah b I think Yeah yeah ID But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple UI Yeah UI Yeah ID If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control UI Okay ID So uh mm mm PM Thats the finance ID Mm ID Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation ID So as we all agree to accept under certain conditions the prototype well have look to the final sh financial view PM Yeah UI Mm UI Okay ID So we need to calculate the production cost ME Mmhmm ID As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID And if not if its not the case y you would have to redesign it PM Oh yeah UI Yeah ID So just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet so so it has the energy source ID We have hand dynamo ID No we dont use that ME No ID We have battery right PM Yeah we have battery ID Kinetic we dont have it I suppose but we have solar cells PM No um solar cells yeah ID Um how many do y do you need solar cells ID Do you think one would be enough or such as as number of branches PM Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah three yeah ID Three PM Three three solar cells ID So electronic ID Single simple chip on print ID Just one would be necessary PM S s simple simple yeah ID One PM Yeah ID Zero for the others ID And sample sensor sample speaker ID One PM Mm PM One maybe yeah ID As we have voice recognition I think PM Yeah yeah yeah ID So the case PM Is it Is sh it Wooden ME So we are all already nineteen ID Okay just keep on going just to have an idea UI The solar cell is too expensive ME Yeah PM Is Yes a wooden pl I and thats Theres no wood so plastic just only I think ID Well uh yeah but what what about case ID Uncurved flat single curved double curved ID I think its more like double curved ME Thats gonna be double curved yeah PM Double curve yeah double curve ID One PM One you have ID Uh wood PM But its yeah a a rubber uh Yeah yeah ME Rather four buttons ME Oh no interface ID Uh do we need special colour ID Y maybe two ME Yeah yeah thats special colours sure ID We have two special colours PM Y y yeah yeah ID Push button UI Mm UI Yeah we have four PM Five UI Five ID Okay ID Scroll wheel UI No ID We don no ID It its more like integrated scor PM I think that this will be like a scroll wheel actually UI No no ME Yeah tha thats wheel PM Y you tu you turn you turn it so Yeah true UI No no no it Okay ID Yeah maybe two scroll wheel as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel ME Yeah PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Okay yeah yeah PM Scr LC display maybe ID So no button supplements ME I think the price is okay UI No ID Okay ME Um no ID Okay we I think we have problem PM Interface ID I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one PM Its okay PM fine ME Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells ME Yeah ID Has it changed PM Yeah it was stage one so ME No y i it did change but just imagine we have Yeah ID Okay UI We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip PM So I think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe UI Oh UI We have to delete the the sample sensor I think ID Yeah but we have you the the voice recognition no ME Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah UI Yeah its the one its m maybe we ha we have two versions the first version the basic version ID Okay UI Advanced version we have speak PM Because uh it seems that this can be yeah wood into plastic and it it should be fine ME Yeah if Yeah ID Or it would be better UI Plastic is free ID So do we need special colour ME Yeah thats one of the requirement ID Because we have red PM Yeah red and yellow UI Wait ID Red and yellow ME We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black PM Fancy UI We we can we can we c yellow ME Black then is a regular colour so ID I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee ME Yeah one ME Yeah ME So push button then its its the next expensive one ID Yeah ID An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button ID And I think this is one ME Yeah thi this might be ID Integrated scroll wheel push button ID So well we have only one ID And push button ME Close to ID So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button its uh Something flat PM One PM I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons so we can just I dunno try to modify some of them to have yeah ME Okay so whats the bottleneck UI How about we change the sale ME Double curved PM Double curve PM We can transform the double curve into single c yeah PM F some Single curve ME Yeah but flat Case whats the ca And then one Euro left ID S uncurved ID Yeah maybe not ID Yeah PM Single curve should be fine so PM Oh what Its its a bad idea so ID Mm UI Ah we have one Okay ID Nearly ME Um ID Maybe dont bat no battery only solar cells ME Um So we have one button one wheel ID I think theres a problem with the push push button ID We only need maybe just one PM Two PM One ID Just one ID Yeah PM Thats fine UI Okay PM Thats fine UI Agree ID So yeah you will have So one button and s scroll wheel with push button on it PM One s one scroll wheel so And the vocal chord its fine PM It I th its fine ID So So yeah ME Its good theyre not charging anything for that ID It think we weve done good job as the cost is twelve fifty e Yeah but its under or equal UI Cou could we have look Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ME Yeah y actually its wrong ME Were not under twelve Euros and a half ID Its not written PM Its fine ID Sometimes its under or equal PM Its under or equal ME Okay PM Its fine so Its fine twelve fifty uh The solar cells r is i is it ME Okay UI Okay UI So lets say Wha what yeah ID Twelve fifty UI Which part is the most expensive part ME Solar cells ID Yeah I think UI Yeah I think its not t t Cheaper ID I think yeah ID But it would i be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative so PM Yeah to be able to si to sell it ME Yeah ME Thats nice argument but if its its still four our of twelve PM Yeah with mi Its it is really really uh really very very expensive though ME Yeah PM Maybe if uh okay UI Okay PM Yeah yeah ME Yeah but we just have one button ID So its easy to use and powerful as the remote control a has only one button ME Easy ME I dont know about powerful ME Yeah PM Its easy to use ID Easy powerful PM Its very easy to use ME Mm ID So I dont think we need to redesign the p the product PM No ME Uh thats what weve just done PM Weve done it with it is under the if it was low high or so ID Yeah ME Yeah ME Um okay ID So Now So So did you enjoy your clay modelling PM So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ME Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno PM Okay okay its fine UI Yes UI Of course UI This is my job ID Yeah ID Was it a nice way to create your remote control UI Yeah its uh its good to to create a control instead of a computer PM Yeah I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end PM And designing looking at the chips the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for UI Yeah ID And for the marketing guy ME Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe PM Yep ME Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards so it um UI Okay PM Okay okay ID And new ideas about new products maybe wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow PM Yellow PM I think you can think about a yellow TV now after a fruit TV or I dunno PM It can be an interesting I dont know Yeah just a lemon TV itd be yellow lemon ID Yes just lemon UI Yeah but y you know the traditional TV its um Yeah yeah its flat yeah the shape is very boring PM Its flat uh Yeah thats right ID Squared UI Could we come up with new TV with such as this kind of TV PM Its really boring yeah PM Yeah UI So you can you have base triangle base so you the TV you can Yeah ID Ah the lemon TV with the pineapple remote control PM Yeah thats that would be really interesting actually UI Yeah UI Because the TV you also Yeah ID Oh thats interesting ID You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things PM Device devi The fruit ID Electronic device ME Yeah but just dont trust too much the trends UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Cause fruit and vegetables it wont last for ten years uh ID Maybe Yeah maybe la next year it will be insects PM Yeah its But I think its good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after you know if the people change their mind you change also the product ME Maybe two years its dead ME Yeah ME Yeah UI Mm ME Yeah but this is good because its not a long long life product PM Yeah ME TV is more like fifteen years maybe so PM Yeah yeah ME If you have a lemon lemon TV for fifteen years Yeah yeah PM Thats a yeah yeah PM We can think about TV with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones you know ID Customable TV PM Yeah you customise it every ti so every ti if people change you just change the appearance and y y you can keep Yeah you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons the fashions uh We int Yeah TV yeah ID Ah such yeah ID Youve already said mobile phones ME Tha that would that would make it UI Okay ME Yeah ID Yeah and following Mm UI Yeah ID Its interesting maybe we can create a a line of uh TV with uh a a tr So I think the costs are within the budget UI Yeah PM A TV for autumn and a TV for winter you know so its So what i and do w is it Okay UI Yeah ID Were just at twelve fifty Euros PM Yeah the pr at Yeah but I think f its really a celebrating object UI Yep ME Yeah ID So do you think you can celebrate your creation UI And you can celebrate your leadership ID Oh thanks a lot ID Thank you mister David Jordan PM So its yellow and very a very ha its very happy so UI Yeah ME Hmm ME Yeah ME Its party party remote control PM Uh its its a pr its like yeah ID The thing now is to to sell it UI Yeah its your job PM Yeah right go and sell it UI Sell it PM Goo and good luck so It should be fine ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve Twenty five Euros yeah ME Uhhuh ME Twenty five Euros ME Yeah I think its Its cheap yeah UI Twenty five Euros ID Its maybe a little bit expensive ME No I Im not so happy about the fruit shape you know UI No its not so expensive PM Wh really PM It should be it should be fine you know actually UI Okay PM S I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good so actually so Its perfect and I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R Okay yeah yeah ID Maybe what you can do a test ME Yeah ID Put it outside and if bees come its really fruit UI Okay ID But dont put sugar in it its not working ME No the colours are uh its perfect yeah ME True ME Uh yeah another thing is the logo is missing still ID Yeah but the colour I think the colour is more is most important because I I dont think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control ME Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had ME Its yeah but it I dont think its such a problem just putting the logo somewhere ID Yeah but we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs ME Yeah ID So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side the double R ME Mm ME Yeah PM Thats actually good idea so Its not a mushroom UI Mm ID So we have the logo we have the colour and we have the fashion in electronics so we have the slogan too UI So we have to give a So we have give him give it a cute name ME Cute na You cannot say mushroom because its not the trend ID Yeah th no its the its the pineapple control remote control UI Mush mushroom controller ID Its a pineapple now it has changed ME Its not the trend PM Its a pineapple remote controls ID Its a pineapple UI Pa Pine apple ID Pineapple PM Yeah pineapple remote remote control ME Yeah but just flying saucer or I would say flying saucer ID With cherry on top UI Okay PM Oh that Oh unid uh unidentified remote control so Thats thats pineapple remote control ME Its more appropriate somehow UI Okay UI Okay PM I think its fine ME Mm UI Okay ID Will you buy one PM Yeah PM Yeah I will try Ill try ID Try to UI Twenty five Euro ID Okay uh One thing I like is the shape because you know its not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket on uh in your jacket PM I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage Yeah I always lose my Yeah so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my TV so it would be I think I would choose this one because of the colour UI Okay UI Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your TV so so you need to buy one UI Okay ME Mm UI Traditional one UI Yeah UI So this one and this one UI What do you choose ID I prefer the laser remote control UI What do you choose ID No PM Its its will enlight your house your home and your TV so UI Okay UI Okay PM Yeah ID Oh ID Maybe next if we decide to do something wed can put light inside PM Yeah yeah that would be uh an idea ME Yeah but thats going to be expensive you know ID Yeah ME We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno ID I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it after yeah ME Yeah afterwards if if its a new trend UI Yeah UI Yeah ME Okay ID So Champagne mister Baba PM Yeah thats that fine PM So we can celebrate now PM Thats our new product ME We should celebrate PM Yes PM Its its fine PM Its I like it UI So buy one PM Next time PM Well Ill buy one here UI Yeah ID So Okay I will close this ME Mm ID Mm PM Yeah PM No ID So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product PM Okay PM Okay ME Yeah ME Our final prototype which yeah PM Final prototype yeah ye yeah ID Final prototype right UI Prototype yeah ID So thank you very much UI Okay PM Okay UI Okay PM Okay ID Very productive UI Okay UI Thanks PM S so who is going to take the remote control,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. The team decided that the prototype required further work. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product."
ID Okay ID Good morning everybody UI Good morning ID Oh everybody is not ready PM Uh almost PM Ready ID Alright ID Okay lets go ID So were here today to to have our first kickoff meeting about uh this new project were going to tak to talk about in a few minutes ID Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager ID Um you are the Okay PM Im uh Michael PM Im the user interface designer ME Hi Im Guillermo ME Im the Marketing Expert UI And I am Hemant the industrial designer ID Okay very good ID Thanks for being here ID Um so lets have a look to the the agenda ID So we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here ID Um then well go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it ID So the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control ID Um it should be original trendy and also user friendly ID As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company ID It is in three step as you know ID First the functional design ID The seconds a conceptual design and then the detailed design ID During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what youve youve you did and what uh we will do next ID So first we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings ID So who want to start PM Ah well if no one else wants to yeah ID Mister PM Okay so want me to draw my favourite animal PM Lets see PM Well I dont really have a favourite animal but um uh I think I have one in mind so uh Im gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board ID You have one in mind PM The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions PM Unless its a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes PM There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web PM And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but its it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else PM So I think they did this in uh in Charlottes Web that movie that little uh well its actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away PM So thats my animal ID Okay ID Th thank you ID Very interesting ID Guillermo you want to ME kay I dunno why but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther or maybe yes UI But dont you think its very difficult to draw a panther ME Uh yeah yeah UI So bad I dont like it ID It would be very funny for us ID Oh ME Okay its a friendly panther PM Maybe its happy cause it just ate someone ME Yeah maybe ME Um ME Actually honestly I I I dunno whats whats his its be behaviour I dunno if if its the male who who hunts or its the female uh I I I have watched that lions di didnt hunt its the the female lions who who hunt so but I like it because its fast and its black as well so it can he it can hide itself very easily and its its it looks like um powerful strong uh I dunno ME I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot ID Okay ID Thank you ME Okay ID Hemant UI Um sure PM So you dont like pink panthers ME I like it UI Oh yeah UI Thanks UI This lapel is coming out once in a while UI Its not very strong UI Okay UI So not the favourite animal but I think Ill draw elephant UI Ill try to draw elephant UI Its a problem UI Okay thanks UI Okay so elephant goes like this and then it has four feet UI I dont know whether theres any dist there should be any distance or not but I think this is the easiest UI And then we have its trunk UI And yep something like this UI An eye cute UI Yeah so and sometimes they have a hump ID Poor elephant UI It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking UI So when they walk wherever they are going to put their first feet the second feet will always be UI When theyll come to that position the second the third feet will be there UI Thats the way they walk UI And thats very peculiar about them UI None of the other animals walk like this UI And they are very useful to human beings UI At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another elephants were very useful UI And they are found in um usually the warm countries UI And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal UI Thats what I know about them UI So thats what I wanted to tell about elephants PM So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant cause you havent drawn the ears UI There are two kind of uh yeah they are very different Indian and African elephants UI So Indian elephant is having one bump I think and the African have two UI And then theres a difference in the trunk of the animals these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants its the trunk is having one Do we have some message there ID Yes ID We have to I have to catch you sorry UI Wind up UI Okay some other time ID We have to to go through the meeting PM Okay UI Thank you ID Thank you PM We can discuss that offline ID Yeah well discuss a f a fly or do well do another meeting abo on elephants UI Thanks ID So so another important part of the project is about money uh and about so about finances ID So we should target selling price of twentyfive Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros okay ID And we should target the inter an international market PM So could I just ask one question um is this a standalone unit that were gonna be selling PM So its gonna be you already have a TV but youre buying an extra remote control for it or something ID O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly so lets go to it PM Okay alright ID So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go ID Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ID Should it be a universal one ID And uh etcetera ID So um so Im waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go PM Okay well so it seems the the first thing that theyve kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make which seems to a kind of a little strange if we dont know what the the product is yet but I guess if thats if thats the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so I guess were gonna need to find out whats actually you know what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product theyre expecting for twentyfive Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control so its Yeah ID Okay ID Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah UI Marketing person UI Mmhmm ID So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go ID So we need to close the meeting ID Uh well have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do ID So um you have to work on the on the working design you have to uh work on the technical functions and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs alright ME Yeah ID Um you will receive some information by emails i as usual ID Thanks for coming today PM Okay UI Thanks ID Thanks PM Alright,"The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the marketing expert, and Hemant the industrial designer. The project manager states the goal of the project, which is to develop a new remote control. It should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. He also mentions the three-step project- functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board. After that they briefly discuss finances. The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market. They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros. The question of whether the remote control should be for a specific device was brought up but not answered. The project manager closes the meeting, telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email."
ID Okay everybody is ready ID Good morning again ID So today we are going to have a f second meeting ID Oh Michael hi PM Yep ID Youre late ID You have a good reason for that PM Yes ID Very good ID Okay lets have a look to the agenda today ID So we are going to have a meeting about the functional design ID Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting ID So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics ID I goin Im going to share with you ID And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design UI Yep ID You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us UI Yeah UI Yep ID The UI guy also uh work on that yeah and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs PM Mm ID Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations ID But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project ID So I just put d quickly Remo but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly ID Any ideas UI Mmhmm PM Uh the Powerstick ID Powerstick yeah ID What else ID What else ME Uh PM Maybe a Spanish name would work well ME Mm I was thinking of the Mando PM Especially if were selling into the US market becasue theres a lot of Spanish speakers there PM Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish PM Mando PM What is that ID Mango ID Mango ME Mando ID Mando ID MA ID MA ME AN yeah DO ID M DO ID Mm okay ME It doesnt it doesnt sound cool for me but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control ID What does it mean ID Oh PM What does it mean in Spanish PM Control ID Hmm PM Okay ID Nice PM Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the mans tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando ME But mm yeah ME Mando sounds Latino ID Okay ID So lets go for Mando ID Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID No objection PM Yeah thats ID Great PM And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O as like Although you dont wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though do you ID So Okay I think this is Okay PM So Yeah UI Yeah they are the most TV watcher UI So we should be careful ID Okay I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel ME But yeah it uh Yeah because if the product will be international Maybe maybe I should uh start PM Marketing ID Something that should be addressed later ID We should we should go to other for the other topics PM Well thats the thing PM We need to know who were selling it to before we can really decide on a Um ID Yeah okay so lets stick f to Man Mando for the name and well see for the for the look and feel later ID So lets go for the three presentations right now ID So who want to start ID So maybe we could start with the market yeah ME Yeah ME Mm ME Okay ID Okay so I have your slides somewhere ME Yeah ME Should be in participant four ID Participant four ME Yeah yeah ID This one ME Uh ID S thats coming ID Uh okay PM Yeah UI Yep ID Great ME Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting ID Mmhmm ME For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements ME I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls ME And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five ten years ME There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and Yeah ID Okay ID Sh next slide ID Okay ME Yeah ME Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly thoroughly ME So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control which is which is good and its interesting point ME Also the people are worried about about the RSI disease which is if you repeat the sa the same movement which is not a with a not very appropriate device you you will have problems whe when you will get old ME So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control ME They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost ID Mmhmm ME And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control ID Okay ME So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldnt be very small because the smaller it is the more like the the liklier it is to get lost ME Liklier or more likely PM More likely ME likely ME Okay ME Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they shouldnt they shouldnt have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control ME Also the z the design should fit the hand shape ME So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes for right and left handed people PM Well th the on the thing is though most remote controls are used by more than one person PM So unless youre kind of targeting single people you know youre gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market ME Yeah ME I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls UI Well maybe it could be a universal design ME Sorry UI A universal design which is which is good for both the hands ME Yeah PM Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand right UI Yeah UI Thats right whether its left hand or right hand but but dont you think that the two points are clashing one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ME Yeah ME Sorry UI The first and the third point they are clashing PM Well it can still be a you can still extend past the hand ME Yeah ID Yeah UI Okay ME Like uh Yeah like No no I was thinking of so like something yeah PM Uh UI So fitting the hand doesnt mean much then PM Well it means like this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or you know with maybe some some finger molds or something UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm UI So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones UI Little sleek longer UI And it should fit the hand ID Something with the shape of the palm UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm PM Some finger grips maybe ME Yeah PM You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything but Yeah ID On the sides ME Yeah yeah ME It sh it shouldnt it shouldnt be symmetric symmetrical UI Mmhm mmhmm mmhmm ME Not anymore ME Thats what yeah ID And then finally Yeah ME And finally the incorporation of a LCD or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting but I dont know if the budget would be large enough ID First Im just wondering about the LCD stuff because uh because Yeah so maybe its a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations ME But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology ID We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to TV PM Yeah ID Okay I dunno if you had this information already PM No ID No so they want us to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations ID Um they want also uh Excellent ME Actually this marketing report is restricted to TV remote controls ID So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally it should be clear that the corporate image that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product ID So Yeah yeah PM I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there this is quite a low uh price if if were maybe I can get to this in my presentation though but um yeah ID Sure sure ID So maybe we can jump to your presentations right now PM Yep PM Okay ID Okay so lets keep in mind about tha that that this last point about LCD and speech uh reco Sorry what is your PM Yeah PM I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if youre watching TV youre gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the TV which might interfere with the Uh participant three PM You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much uh harder so ME Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate so yeah yeah PM Oh you press a press a button to talk and the the TV the TV sound turns off ME Yeah uh channel fifty ME Yeah UI No it could be command control kind of thing UI It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated UI Means you say you should say like does that remote control being on or be on kind of thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition PM Yeah UI Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the TV also PM Yeah UI So there should be something command controlled you start and then you stop PM Mm PM Yeah UI Its like VI editor you are having two modes similarly UI Otherwise its just lying idle ID Okay Michael PM Okay so could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse or Mm ID Sorry ID Um yeah PM Thanks PM Okay ID The wheel doesnt work PM Great PM Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote and just uh looked to see if theyre actually available in any current remotes and then also searched for which are the toprated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site PM So um theres a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant but its not really its by no means uh mm you know on its own in being so expensive PM There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there ID Looks like a PDA PM So yeah it doe its well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the LCD screen except for the really really kind of main functions which have a couple of of their own buttons PM Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market I know were working on television remote but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these LCD screens which kind of helps when youre using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times PM But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control and its kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide but it has a scroll wheel on it which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel which I think is its a really kind of important design aspect um is its Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do PM And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel UI Change the channels UI Yeah PM Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel PM Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad UI Mmmhmm mmhmm PM I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a twodigit number and then two numbers so thats just uh its annoying UI Yeah yeah PM So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy PM Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an LCD screen and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability ID Mmhmm PM One possibility if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff cant be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro but one possibility is to download program information into the LCD screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programmes on you know often you dont know what ch what channel its on or you dont know whats on PM If you have a list of of programs on your LCD screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel PM So if you think about its kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you dont use you dont remember peoples phone number you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it PM So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have but um we we really need t to discuss the price PM So I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where its its its very simple theres only a few buttons but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context PM So this is something else we might wanna consider is really kind of limiting the number of buttons because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions PM It its really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button theyre looking for without even looking at the remote control PM And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important but also the number of buttons PM So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want UI But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality PM So Yeah well we w Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that were only doing uh a television remote control ID Mmhmm UI Because the same button is doing too many things PM Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flipopen um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time but contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons for instance UI Mmhmm PM Um I I would if I had my perfect remote control Id probably just have no numbers at all on it because theyre just in the way UI Mmhmm PM They dont really do anything PM Maybe you know I although I do also find flipopen doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good UI Mmhmm PM Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device PM Um Well I guess that depends on how you market it ME H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldnt be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think its very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If y Im sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it UI It does sampling out of the PM If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can you know navigate to a program without the numbers then people might say that looks pretty easy ID Okay can you continue please Mi PM So but yep PM Um okay so I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number PM So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing PM Um mm theres the LCD screen um which maybe maybe is too expensive um but I think also at the scroll wheel I havent mentioned it here the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen just for changing channel numbers easily PM I think even that I mean that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an LCD screen to implement um but I think that would be quite useful as well ID Mmhmm PM And the other thing you say we need to we need to keep it just television but I think one maybe one option since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device is you know theres a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology and maybe we wanna make it something thats extensible to do other tasks PM Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can say uh change the lighting in the room PM You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesnt have to be part of the initial development but you know later on you could you can you know you also selling the potential of the device PM Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights I dunno close the windows whatever turn the heating on and um I think thats something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool since we say were putting the fashion in electronics ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay thanks UI Yep ID you want to go UI So yeah UI So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh that means on my own I yeah it should be ID This one ID Great ID No not that one ID you are two UI Two ID Alright UI Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology UI So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote UI So the old kind of users who dont want to have any changes it can it can be useful for them and the new users as uh our Marketing Expert was saying they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing ID Okay sorry to interrupt you but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel UI Thats right UI So anyway that didnt come into my mind so th that is a possibility ID Okay UI These could be other kind of interfaces UI Means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different kind of interfaces UI So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with UI So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twentyfive Euros money which we are thinking ID Mmhmm UI Otherwise we are just like others in the market UI So anyway that is the first user interface could be of more than one type and uh yeah that means we can do the online changes which which cannot be done now actually UI So apart from the speech we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons UI Now for buttons normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required UI And for voice limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote ID Yeah ID That increases the the cost also UI Uh thats right UI But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that ID Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough UI Uh yes if it is limited vocabulary usually its enough ID Okay UI Yeah we we can uh target means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc Thats right ID Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control PM Hmm UI No it it could be little d yeah it could be Thats right ID So it could be s a few centimetres PM Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets though because Im not sure exactly where were gonna sell this but I presume its not gonna just be English speaking countries UI Thats right ID Yeah PM So then you have to s you know you have to train models for Yeah UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Uh its more like means there are different speech technologies which are existing so DTW could be kind of which is the easiest UI So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself and its just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a microcontroller ID Okay ID Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide UI Yeah thats right UI Yeah UI So we can Thats right ID This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion UI Yep ID Okay next UI Yep ID Uh that finished UI No no UI Components ID No ID Components UI Yeah UI So will you go to the next slide ID Yes sure UI Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so UI We are having a power button and the switch which is not much and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not UI And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time UI So we could not put that UI So now where the ASR decoder is sitting similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there UI So there is ASR decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller and then there could be buttons and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format UI And then there is there is the chip which is sitting the green one and it converts it into bit codes and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver ID Okay UI So this is the easiest design the there could be UI So th an ASR decoder we can have things in UI To have different technologies UI So this was the my personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control PM You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as youre using it by saying you know turn volume up and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well by speaking and doing Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up UI So these are the slight problems ID Okay ID So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies UI Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I dont have much idea but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the Mmhmm PM Actually Im not so sure because Im the you know if I was using a remote control to say turn the volume up because I cant hear it very well I dont really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when Im when Im instead of pressing up on on a remote control ME Im sure PM You know if theres some theres some dialogue all of a sudden that I cant hear Im trying to actually find out whats being said so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps ID Yeah ID Okay so Okay gentlemens we have to take some deci decisions right now ME Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons its about its about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour or something like that PM Well it depends if its a remote control th Maybe if the remote control is something that y you dont actually have to pick up anymore that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion PM If you can leave it sitting on the table and you dont actually have to find it then that could be UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Alright ID Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything weve de we we said ID We are targeting TV ID We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small not too big ID Um we have or good shape yes ME With a good shape for the Yeah ID We should bring new technologies for young peoples and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet ID Maybe this is something we can stick to it ID And um also a very interesting things I I Ive seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate ID So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price its not possible to go s to go to LCD and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies ID Uh first m m why not to go to LCD ID Because um in fact as we are targeting uh TV in fact we can use TV screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have PM Well it depends though well it depends PM If we we dont unless we have some input some video input to the TV or we have control over the TV then we cant actually display that PM Like if we if we produce the TVs then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the TV to superimpose those those menus PM So thats an extra cost ID Yeah thats right ID Don dont you ha dont we have contacts with uh people on TV or or well systems that exist that we can use PM Well this is this is another que we still havent really defined the remote PM Are we still you say were focusing on TV but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that its a replacement remote control or is this something for our own line of of televisions ID Yeah PM Cause that really makes a big difference PM Cause even if we have contacts we cant really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies TVs PM Its just there are too many TVs out there ID Yeah PM Its its not really gonna For twenty five Euro ID Thats good point ID Whats what cou what could be the cost of uh well could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to LCD on the remote control ID Yeah UI Its not possible PM I think its impossible UI Its impossible PM But but I dunno I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics PM So I would I would like to know if theres any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price ME Uh What would be Wha but what would be one question what would be the goal of putting an LCD in a remote control ID So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah because yeah ID Okay so regarding the automatic speech recognition I think this is They have tele teletext PM Well th Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers like an interactive programme guide ME What what kind of information ME Yeah but mo most of the TVs nowadays show the show the the n Yeah but yeah most of the TVs have teletext nowadays ID Well because they have teletext on it ID Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel ID They have t most of them have teletext but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet ME Yeah ID So to to uh to browse more easily the teletext PM You can get a lot more information on it ID For instance through uh through your remote control ME So what would what would appear in the in the LCD PM So you could have the name of the programme you could have um the start time you know where its up to ID The ti the start time all the p all the programmes you could have uh o Well I dont know if this information is available from teletext also PM You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading Well no but there are the electronic programme guides out there ME Okay UI Are But just a small thing what kind of market we are targeting PM They may not have pictures but maybe they do PM Theres dependi it also depends on the country ID Well because for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the TV ID We c we couldnt grab information information which is not there PM No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from PM So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that ID So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control if you want to browse in addition to the TV or uh or it should be a special TV connected to Okay ME But Yeah PM Uh PM Well I I think if were gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I dont think you could even get teletext information from the TV onto the remote control especially if we dont control the TV PM I dunno PM We need to find that out ID We need to close the meeting ID Um so Very quickly UI Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market or what UI So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself UI That is very important ID No PM Mm PM If its a really small TV maybe ID Yeah well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their and they want to go t for universal one and they take the fanciest they can have UI Broke UI Okay UI Okay UI Okay UI Okay UI Okay UI Okay ID So this is that we z that that we should target ID So the com the um the uh the committment is the following we dont go for speech recognition technology UI Mmhmm ID The LCD is still on disc is still open to discussion ID It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting ID So Yeah but not sure ME I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the LCD UI Its its cheaper as compared to the LCD ID Maybe its cheaper but we have no Okay this is this is an open question for you ME Because with the LCD you need more requirements ME You need a internet connection ME You need m more things ME But for the speech recognition you you dont need anything PM Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe or a you know ME You just say channel fifty and thats it ME But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars its To move to another target UI Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah thats right PM Well this is what we need to find out PM Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control PM Cause otherwise we need Its kind of hard to guarantee that youre gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though ID Yeah ID This is uh up to you to tell us ID But Im definitely not keen on to to no no no Im no Im definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies ID Im not confident enough ID Im not sure that that well have a product really that work ID I uh that work Its real yeah ID How to guarantee such performances is really hard ME the expert uh said ninety five percent ID Well this is still is is very bad ID So this is the end of this discussion ID Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on ID Um so you have to work on the component uh concept UI Okay ID Uh you have to work on user interface and you have to go through a trend watching ID Okay ID So the question is still open about the LCD thing ID Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh well take some um decision that direction ID Thanks PM Yep ID Bye,"The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. He suggests they name the project and they come up with ""mando"", meaning ""control"" in Spanish. The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents. He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on."
ID Okay ID Good afternoon ID Hope you have good lunch UI Afternoon PM Hi UI Yeah we had falafel ID Oh ID Nice ID And you PM Uh yes I had something similar but nonvegetarian ID Okay ID So today is um our third meeting ID It will be about the conceptual design uh ID If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um ID We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of LCD screen on on the remote control because of costs ID So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today ID Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point ID So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us ID So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ME Okay ID So marketing ID So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere ME Yep ID So youre four ME Four yeah ID Which is trend watch ID Okay ID Mr Marketing Experts ME Yeah thats me ID So Mmhmm ME Uh ME Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users ME Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends PM Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay ME Okay ME Well wha what I found um can you Yeah ID Next slide ID Yeah ME Thank you ME What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device ME After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking but the most what they what they find more more interesting more or more important its uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel ME So now more more cool aspect ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things a device which is pleasant to to watch to see ID Okay ME Uh also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes furniture and all this all this fashion its its fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables ID Mm ME And also in the in the USA the the current the mor the most popular feeling its its a spongy ME Spongy means eponge UI Mmhmm ME So maybe we should we should think in in this direction so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan PM What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy PM What you mean clothe No I missed that one UI Spongy means it its like sp But whats your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ME Yeah I I didnt miss an I didnt miss and I saw that the fruit there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes PM Oh theyre okay so theyre not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on okay ME No no not not yet not yet ME Yeah yeah PM So were not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of ME So te textu textures yeah ME Yeah ME Vegetable textures and all this kind ID Drawings of bananas ME Uh yeah yeah ID Uhhuh ID Well so this is in the next slide certainly ME Uh no no its not ID Its not ME Its And Um ME I ha I havent thought of any particular fruit but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable some kind of instead of vegetable some natur mm uh natural object or something UI Mmhmm ME But yeah it it depends on the Yeah maybe the shape the shape No not n not not too much focus not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different ID So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the LCD PM Oh so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant UI Means buttons are in the shape of fruits buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something apple banana something like that ID Apple for channel one UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME So we shouldnt be at re really attached to to the trend but For instance yeah ME African or as an elephant UI That we can discuss afterwards PM But okay Im not Im not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though maybe just to fashion gurus like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner but I dont know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a an orange is ID Okay ME Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing ME I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control PM To fruit PM But is it uh is fruit cool ME What ID Thats a question ME What PM Is fruit cool ME Yeah ME Uh Is the new trend of the No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some Yeah PM Well I guess you know Apple has the iPod so imagi just cause they have an apple on their on their product doesnt mean fruit is cool PM Okay but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know you dont wanna pear or a watermelon ME Don dont you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use PM Well probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of a cucumber UI Banana UI Mmhmm PM I dunno ME Or m Maybe ID Maybe too long PM Maybe PM Too green PM So but I mean you also have to you have to also have fit r all the buttons and you know ID A banana ME Um Yeah PM Its it The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if youre gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build UI I dont th it will be rolling a lot ME Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldnt have a lot of buttons b buttons so Uh do you want a an LCD with twenty five Euros ID Okay ID Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a LCD on a banana also PM Yeah ID Well youre the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not PM Well this is Okay ME I think Well according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation so I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also its Im not convinced about this LCD because you need uh internet connection you need more things its not just buying a new control re remote you need buying control remote buying uh more things ID So So you you you suggest to go f Okay ID S so youre simply youre simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons ME Its not so simple ME For instance yeah ME Yeah for for for given an an example yeah ID Okay good ID So maybe you can go ahead ME Yeah no its what I already said ID Okay ID Thanks ID Um ID Okay Ill give the floor ID So you are User Interface guy ID So youre three PM Yeah ID And its this one PM Yep ID Go for it PM Yep PM Okay PM So PM S next uh slide PM Okay PM So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control UI But its just a speaker right PM Its no what it is its its very It has a has a microphone has a speaker its got a little chip and it allows you t Well its a sample sensor sample speaker UI Its not a microphone UI Mmhmm UI Actually Im not reading microphone there so thats why you can all have conversation it just to speak to you PM Sample sensor sample speaker PM It means that it can recognize it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM But uh theres no kind of um understanding of the phrase UI Okay PM So I mean you know I guess you could build that in you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control UI Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm PM But basically the thing is we have this technology available inhouse UI Inhouse PM So um but the thing is obviously theres still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM Whilst you know some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it Its it its no well its itll recognize uh I guess keywords but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase ID I theres something that I unclear really understanding ID Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords PM You train it for a certain uh for a certain phrase you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well theyve actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that were producing is you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and itll playback good morning how would you like your coffee ID And its just to its just to playback something PM Yeah PM So actually that was a bad example cause it doesnt actually ask how do you want your coffee because it cant really understand the response so ID Yeah yeah ID So this is not s really to do to to do control PM Only like only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an Its designed its designed as a fun kind of thing but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh Completely pointless yeah ID Yeah ID This is just more like a poi pois yeah ID Yeah yeah ID So it its c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view ME Yeah but you can u Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay channel fifty channel twenty PM Yeah PM Yeah unless you know you like having conversation with your remote control ID Okay PM Well yeah thats the thing if you can but you have to pro though I think its a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen that whole thing not just the word channel and the word fifteen it doesnt have that kind of logic in it ID Yeah yeah ID So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology bringing it to the remote control and using it UI Mmhmm PM So Yeah that would be some development work ID So this is out of discussion PM Yeah ID So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm bananabando yeah ME M Mando PM Bananamando ME Bananamando yeah PM Bananaman I uh I I I dont think its worth it though I think it doesnt really add much to the functional design and its its its not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine so Um yeah ID Uh then it could be cool yeah UI Yeah okay lets go ahead ID Okay ID Okay PM So if we can just move on to the next slide Ive just done a quick mockup of uh uh some of the features of our potential funkylooking uh remote control Well you see I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus um so at the moment its more of a box focus ID It doesnt look like a banana at all ID Yeah ID But you you can fit i youre saying now you can fit it to Yeah ME Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit ME Yeah PM Yeah well this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit thats designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes PM But um Ive just indicated here we could have actually two scroll wheels cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of you know I think everyone has has agreed that its that it could be quite a useful um thing so UI Stable thing thats right UI To have mmhmm mmhmm PM But I think its important you know to have two scroll wheels because you know you want one for for the channel but you also want one for for the volume because its its the volume i its you know its very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response so ID Mm UI Mmhmm mmhmm PM But um Ive also included this turbo button because I think you know every design should have a turbo button and well so this is you know a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television the uh the tuner on the TV is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll so you know the th the person might want to have a uh Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing whats on them in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then you know displays that station ME Whats a turbo button PM Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it even if it lags behind what theyre doing ME It con it controls the speed PM Yeah so with this turbo button you can say skip over t channels if uh you know if Im if Im going if Im scrolling past them and you know its um you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know its really going fast or whatever PM So yeah thats um those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need um UI Mmhmm PM You know i it could be you know if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device I mean we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very if its gonna be a banana you know thats a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesnt have that much functionality its just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause its hard to get so many buttons on a banana and its still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote but if they have these scroll wheels so um you know what other buttons do we want ID Its enough UI Mmhmm PM I mean we could have well I guess you need an on and off switch but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe you know its kind of like a spy kind of flick thing ID Switch on ID Yeah ME Yeah ME So sounds crazy ME I like crazy ideas PM Thats why youre a marketing guru ID Okay ME Yeah of course ID So i it looks like were going completely to forget about the LCD thing PM Well thats the thing as have we decided that we can only spend uh twenty five Euro ID I think that No we can we cant use that PM Well not spend but you know charge twenty five Euro ME I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so ME You we can ID We cant use that to to comman co communicate its just a thing No ME We cant UI Communicate ME Yeah but we can say channel twenty five UI Its one way ME No PM But then you have to have a template for every channel for a hundred channels you have to be able to to recognize Mm ME Its not a lot one hundred templates its not Ah its designed for a cof okay UI Mmhmm PM Well I f I think its probably more than than our can handle because its designed for a coffee machine you know to say hello in the morning ID Yeah ME Is it design for a coffee machine PM Well thats its current application I would presume that its kind of they wouldnt design it to handle a hundred things th so ME Okay ME Yeah ME Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID A good good good thing PM But uh Well I just I just made the point I dont I dont know if that speech recognition is you know even if we can do it I think its not really appropriate for uh television environment ID You want to g to move to your slides UI Yeah thats right yeah ID Youre finished ID Yeah I think so PM But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know a base station that can control other things as well ID Mmhmm PM It might be useful to have some kind of base station even if its just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping you know this is a way of finding the remote PM Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say Im here but uh its probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping Its speech Its its speech synthesis and s its speech kind of not really speech recognition but kind of pattern matching yeah yeah ID Mm ID Exactly yeah UI So its a speech synthesis kind of thing something has been uh stored and its just uh spoken out UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Thats right ID Oh good idea ID Very good ID Okay lets move on ID So youre two UI Thats right ID Okay UI So this is going to be about the component design ID Mmhmm UI So first thing is we need power source for the remote control UI So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies one is the usual batteries which are there they could be chargeable batteries if theres a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so itll be pretty uh innovative kind UI Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls its not broken directly into pieces there should be some flexibility in t Yeah PM I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy ID Yeah UI So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve UI The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve UI Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they dont feel that its an alien thing for them PM So just one second when you say double curve what do you actually mean PM You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the on the whiteboard cause Im not sure Okay but like kind of convex or concave UI Double curve is you have curves on both the sides if Im right UI So its symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is UI So it could be curve so it could be convex conve concave depending on what what we want PM Mmhmm PM Okay UI So there are flats there are single curve and there are double curves PM Okay UI These are the three things and there are different materials with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve UI So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood titanium and all those things but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one itll bring the cost down and anyway its Wooden cases Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Although you know wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option if you take like nice quality kind of wood thats got a nice grain and you kind of put some some varnish on ID Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be Yeah but the components inside PM Well it depends I mean you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you dont have to worry too much about the case being broken its the inside PM Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning thats not visible to the to the user ID Yeah ID Very too expensive to do UI Mmhmm ME Yeah PM And I mean you could also you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well ID And also uh Yeah but its more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood PM Thats true but are we set on the banana idea ME Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not its not really handy ID Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah ID Yes it is ME Uh I dont know the name o o in English uh This its not a fruit its a vegetable UI Is it an e apple which has Banana is more handier as compared to this I think and to capsicum PM Its like a pumpkin or Green ID Yeah ID Pumpkin ME Green ID Green ID Um um um yes I see PM What does it taste like ME And you put in the salad ID Pep pepperoni ME Um Oui cest ca Pepper PM Ah yeah is it whats it in French ID Poivron PM Yeah okay so capsicum or pepper ID Uh pepper PM Yeah ID But um they do d Yeah ME And its al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No I mean in a Im sure its fun PM I dont know it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me like like with a banana you can have Well But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that but with uh I dont know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that when you say speaker support you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way or is just the the signal ID Yeah ID Its not re it you you think its really fancy and fun ID You think that young people that are Yeah ID More than a banana ME But banana is not so handy I think thats handier ID Yeah ID Its kind its kind of its more uh its really ergonomic its fit in the hand and youve a lot of surface to to put the controls ID Okay lets move on ME Yeah youre right ID So time is running lets move on UI Okay so push buttons for the traditional users so that they dont feel they are alienated just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection volume control and teletext browsing UI These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that ID Okay UI Yeah we can go to the next slide UI Then uh there are different kind of chips one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip UI So we can have regular chip for control UI Pricing is a factor for us thats why well go for the regular chip UI And uh regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced UI It could be a beep kind of thing UI Yes yes thats right its its onto the chip most most probably not not hundred per cent sure about that PM Okay PM Okay PM So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana UI That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already predefined UI It should be whatever will be the case the chip is always going to be sitting inside PM Okay PM Yeah but the speaker if the speaker is actually on the chip then if its too far away from the the casing or if the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker UI Mmhmm UI Uh so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better PM Yeah UI As or as hearing is concerned we can have some gap at some place so that Thats right PM Yeah PM So thats something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside UI Okay UI Yeah UI So these these were the component selection and these things UI We can go to the next slide UI And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV because users are like this and they dont want to have one remote control for everything so with this additional little we might be having slightly better market for us PM Although if It depends if we like if we are concentrating on like a fruit design then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit you know like a different fruit for each device UI Mm UI Of fruits UI Mmhmm PM Cause that you know that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type UI Remotes objects okay ID S objects ID Crazy objects ME I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits PM Well youre the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place ME No but I think just one fruit to control everything PM Like a power fruit ME A power fr a power M a Mando a Supermando fruit UI And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote PM Yeah ID Okay ME Actually I I didnt understand very well this trace speaker lost control PM Well I think thats a pretty handy feature ID Okay good UI So youre having a basis station UI Okay UI Your usually your remote sits on that UI So you and its thats why it can have chargeable batteries UI Now lets say Basis station is with the thing ME So you you have to buy two things the banana and the basis station ID Bu its its ID You s you you thing UI Its like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there UI So now what user gets additionally he doesnt have to buy batteries theyre rechargeable batteries so over the period of cor time hell recover the cost UI So youre having the basis station and there is a button if you press that button wherever the remote itll start beeping so you know where the remote is UI Uh Mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm ID Yeah ME Yeah PM I think its kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasnt uh a recharging station even if they didnt have to buy extra batteries you know ME Yeah but Im a bit worried about the budget PM So Although you do need to include RF kind of circuitry in the remote UI Uh this is basis station is nothing more just its a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh youre having one socket on which the thing sits ID Mmhmm UI Thats right UI But all these things are usually inhouse so we dont have much problems UI So component cost is going to be the least UI Anyway we are not using really advanced technology LCD has already been ruled out ASR has been ruled out UI So its the basic thing but very trendy and very userfriendly PM Okay UI And Mmhmm PM Im just wondering actually cause you know I this whole fruit thing with the banana its um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche like only a few people would really want a banana but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana PM You know rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana you could make it kind of silver PM And um you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch PM For better want of a better word you know ID You think that yellow its kitsch PM Well you know I don I dont know how many peop Well they Yeah like this colour this colour Maybe you know maybe like still in the shape of a banana ID If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana ME Yeah ME No I I Maybe li like that UI A yeah otherwise itll be mis means you dont get b any feeling then ID O otherwise Roughly UI Its neither a banana nor a And uh going to the last slide PM No exactly PM Exactly PM Um but you know just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of you know because the thing is its gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape PM I think if youre gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of you know twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies ID Yeah ID Okay ID Lets move on ID Uh uh yeah ID Before before st before ending the meeting Id like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype PM Okay ID Go for it UI Okay ID Well no not not you you can finish your slides before Mm okay UI Okay UI Okay so UI Anyway usersll be so the findings is usersll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes UI So that was very I thought its a very good suggestion by everybody ID Okay UI Thats it ID Thats all UI Yep ID Okay so mm so well done for the presentations ID So we need to take some de decisions about um about what were going to do ID So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and were going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device I do I dont remember you call it PM Yeah PM Okay UI Mmhmm UI Thats right UI The basis station ID Basis station yeah UI Thats right ID Uh so um so were going for a stylish banana shape PM Yeah so I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than cause you dont want it to point kind of towards the floor ID Yeah right PM So you know so if you have like Okay so So okay so I guess we need you know something that can fit a banana shaped object ME What about what about this shape ME More or less ID We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing UI Theres less space on this to put with the buttons ME Yeah but how many buttons do we need ID If you dont want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you dont have to do it in fact its better UI Uh what about a The base station ID So ti time is running we have to we have to we have to to move forward ID So lets skip to uh this uh this this this idea ID Yeah ID So we have this ID We have a a basis um how do you call it ID A base station UI Right ID Well have a base station extra uh on the side UI Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Uh we have a RF for um for beeping for beeping UI Thats right yeah we need that yeah ID We need b RF to beep PM Okay so its uh Yeah ID So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis UI Basis station ID Basis station thank you UI Yeah yeah PM Alright so we need uh okay ID Can you go quickly please PM Yeah ID Okay ID So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button PM Yeah PM Yeah which I think its its probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device so you have Yes UI Turbo button ID Yeah on the th yeah maybe here ID And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance PM Yeah so you have the thumb kind of here ID And and you have two wheels PM So yeah you need one one here and one on on the other side so you got volume an and channel ID Okay right ID Good PM And uh No LCD ID So no LCD ID Okay great ID Um ID Very good UI Okay PM Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well ID Yeah UI Uh for the remote PM Yeah ID Oh just the switch no f not for the TV for the TV UI Remotes dont have power on off switch PM Yeah ID Uh so you On the side UI Okay UI S no thatll be controlled by the those buttonsll be there already yeah ME What a What about Four millions PM Where UI Means on the remote UI Because remote is going to have both the interfaces scroll as well as buttons PM Okay UI They are not going to cost you much everything is inhouse and now you dont want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this PM Well I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place you know UI Oh yeah UI Thats thats another issue which I didnt think of PM Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um Yeah how many of these did we wanna sell UI But you know our targets are very high means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make PM I cant remember what was Yeah but how many units did we need to to sell UI Twenty five UI Twelve point five is the profit on one ID Twenty five UI Uh forty th four UI Point point four million PM Four point four million UI Point four million PM Thats a lot of fruit ID Yeah UI In the market ME What about a I wo what about adding the this word spotting keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ID So ID Well ID No ID Time is running we have to close the meeting in a few minutes PM Okay ID So okay the next step you can come back to your seat PM Okay ID The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype based on this okay PM Okay ID So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things ID You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype UI Mmhmm ID Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation ID Okay ID Its too difficult ME Its too difficult but people like innovation and thats really uh innovative and I dont know if it would cost a lot just a few five words ID Its not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype so t its in the next prototype so lets skip it PM Uh ME Okay UI For the future prototypes ID Yeah maybe for the n if if if it it works well well go for uh an orange one PM That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando ID Yeah yeah honour the fruit ME Plus plus okay ME Maybe objective banana ID Okay ID Thanks very much ID Well see n next meeting ID Bye UI So meetings over PM Okay PM Yep UI Okay PM We have to go design the prototype UI Okay UI Okay UI Thank you ID Thank you ME Thank you,"The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next, the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. They agree on having base station with the remote. They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV."
ID Okay ID Good afternoon again ID So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control ID Um So here is the agenda for today ID Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two sounds interesting ID And well have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts ID Then well have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro ID Okay ID So lets go ID Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting ID So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions ID No LCD no speech recognition technology okay we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control ID We went through the use of wheels and but buttons ID And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost ID Okay ID Um ID Good ID So guys let this uh wonderful thing UI Okay so we can go to the slides ID Oh yeah ID Sorry UI Yeah ID Um UI Number three UI Oh number two sorry ID Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe UI So final design UI Final design UI Okay so Michael you can go ahead PM Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana remote okay so we actually have a Weve well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that its not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself its kind of its its ergonomic it fits in the hand uh rather well UI You can pull it out first maybe ID Mmhmm PM Weve got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally ID Whats the use uh of the t turbo button already PM This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Yeah ID Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops PM Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops PM But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture UI Uh And we we do have one more functionality ID Uhhuh UI If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button so it switch ons the switch ons the TV PM The TV yeah ID Which one PM The s the turbo button UI The turbo button PM So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button ID Okay UI Additional button ME What this button for PM This is a teletext button ME Okay PM So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh To navigate yeah ID To navigate it through th through teletext ME But if you want to go to page seven hundred UI Thats right thats right PM Yeah ID with the wheel its easy ME How man I dont understand it PM Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f Mm uh And this is the uh the infrared uh port ME Can you repeat it ME Yeah UI So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing UI And you can tele yeah once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext they are no more for channel or vol volume ME Ah okay okay ME Okay ME Okay okay ME Okay ME I see ME I see UI Yeah ME Okay ME Okay UI Thats right PM Also the top of the banana UI Yeah ID Excellent PM So PM And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana ID Calling UI Yeah ID Excellent ID And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas PM Actually they do PM Thats thats yeah thats uh thats form and function in the one in the one uh object ID Oh UI Yeah UI So it always means whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage UI Its like antennas PM Yeah PM So PM But yeah thats um thats just like thats an attractive um base station ID Great PM So PM Okay ID So what else UI And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries ME Is it really weight ME Is it light or Okay UI It is very light ID Yeah theyre light PM Its its uh its about the weight of a banana ME Okay PM You know to give you the correct look and feel UI Yeah ME Ok Okay UI And we have put these different colours so that people dont mistake them mistake it as a banana UI Otherwise its you know a child comes and so Yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah I see ME I under I understand PM I think a child would try to eat it anyway so maybe we should consider that PM maybe health and safety aspects ID Ah yeah UI Mmhmm UI Oh we didnt think of that yet PM Yeah UI Yeah ID So for the power source apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries UI Oh yeah thats right ID Uh you mean okay ID So Yeah where are going to where are you are you going to place them PM I dont really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station UI Mmhmm mmhmm UI Itll Itll be always at top somewhere at there PM If I was gonna place them Id put them on the on the top here since thats like uh the black bit but yeah I dont I really dont think its necessary to have the solar cells anymore ID You have enough surface ID You Okay UI Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is PM Mm ID What will be the autonomy ID Roughly PM The what sorry ID The autonomy ID Autonomy PM What do you mean ID Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ME How long the how long the bit the batteries long PM Ah PM Ah PM A long time ID Yeah UI Eight to ten eight to ten hours ID A long Yeah so its Its used only when you Yeah PM No no no it can it should be weeks UI N most no most of the time its not being used PM Yeah but y people dont like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so Ah okay UI So when when you are making it on Mm UI Mmhmm UI No eight or eight or ten hours of working UI If you are just leaving like that itll be much longer PM Okay ID F weeks UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Thats right ID Right ID Next slide UI Yeah UI And we are having the speakers regular chip for control UI Pricing is was a factor so thats why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip UI And uh thats it ID Okay ID Okay ID Those really sounds very good UI Thats right ID Nothing else to add PM It seems to be falling over ME I l yeah ID Yeah ME I like I like it ME Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons ME Looks a bit Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that UI You want to have more functional buttons ME You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y its teletext or not And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits UI You are not convinced UI Not not many we we want to keep it simple UI So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that the channel buttons they baco become the scrolling buttons UI Its up to you means UI Now that Means lets say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits ID Well in fact b both will be could be useful navigating through teletext PM Or can move between positions in the in the number UI Thats right ID Yeah ME Butto real buttons ID Wow UI Yeah UI So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape UI So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing they they dont care about the buttons any more ME Okay UI And anyway Evalua yeah ME Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff PM Its all automatic ME Its all automatic PM Yep ME Okay ME Okay yeah its fine ID Very good uh yeah you th yeah ME W we are living in a wonderful world PM Uh ID Bananas everywhere ID Okay so So we have to go through now evaluations ME Automatically configure ME Yeah ID So your slides are ready ME S Yeah ID Uh youre four I think ID So this is one which one is this one ME Yeah ME Okay ME I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements ME And each criteria is will be evaluated its uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if its true or is or if its false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven UI Why this strange factor of seven ME Because i Im sorry ME Sorry UI Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten ME Ah yeah ME Its from sorry its from one to seven ME Its from from one to seven sorry ME Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale and five is too short and nine is too long UI Okay ID Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity its in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation UI Okay UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Okay fine got the idea ME Im a I Im Sorry ME Yeah yeah UI Okay ME The variance is mi its is minimal ID Okay UI Okay okay great ME Im um answering your question UI Okay ME Okay UI Yeah yeah UI Go ahead ME And thats the criteria I I found more useful ME I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard UI Mmhmm UI Sure ME And we all four could range could evaluate the Okay lets lets evaluate if its fancy or Seven but I would say seven UI Okay UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah ID Okay UI So you can say fancy handy UI Handy UI Yeah its fancy according to me ID Yeah six UI Seven ID S seven UI Seven by me ID Six UI Okay ME Its quite fancy UI So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus Five ID No wait PM Yeah uh five ID What do you say seven ID Five PM Five maybe maybe maybe six its its I guess its yeah ID Okay six point five ID Handy UI Again Ill give seven ID Seven PM Id give it a six like Id I think its probably more handy than my current remote cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote ME Six UI Yep ID So seven seven six six point five UI Seven for me PM Yeah ME Six ID Functional UI Ill give five ID Four ME I would say Everything ar Mm everything Its compared to the all remote controls PM Well it depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we want it to do or d does what it does you know can it make you coffee PM You know ID Uh for a remote control does he have all the you could expect PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Thats right UI Thats right PM Thats before Yeah UI The standards UI What is available in the market off the shelf PM I have to say four ME Actually I dont know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Ah its not an univer but its for all kind of TVs PM Well its not a universal remote PM Remember were focus were supposed to focus just on TVs UI We Five ID Yeah PM Well all TVs but only T only TVs I guess ID So its universal but for TVs ME Yeah ID So s uh four ID Five PM Four ID Four ME Four ME Four UI So four point two PM Just four ID Four UI four ME So four PM Obviously there are some outliers so Which Ill say five ID Okay cool ID Cool device UI There Ill give it seven ME It means cool features like new features actually UI Thats right UI For a TV the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature UI And then the scroll buttons are again cool features UI We dont have LCD for it but that we decided we dont want to have ID Yeah ID Seven ME I would say five UI Mmhmm ID Six UI Seven ID Plus six I say I said seven PM Yeah ID So its six PM S yeah ME You said seven ID Yeah PM Cause its five five seven seven so Uh okay definitely easy to use UI Okay UI Definitely seven PM Seven ID Seven ID Seven ID And you ME Five ID Outl you are not lik outlier ID Seven Okay okay okay okay ME Sorry I have them Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end UI Okay PM Alright now heres the sixty million Dollar question well twenty five twenty five Euro question ID Of course Ill buy the banana PM What do you what do you guys reckon UI Ill say five ID Well Twenty five Euros UI Ill say five PM Hmm ME I find it quite cheap actually ME I dunno ME If i i it depends if you live in in Switzerland or you live in I dont know ID Cheap ID Yeah so the target price is for all Europe or only for rich countries ID Its more targeting UK or So this is selling costs not production costs ME Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or Yeah this is the the initial specifications PM Uh Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah yeah sure ID Um Five ME I would say six ME Its quite cheap actually PM Id say two UI Why PM I dont want a banana on my living room table a banana remote ID Aw should be nice in your Its kitsch UI No but its really handy actually if you see PM It is handy its handy but it its terrible UI Its its so handy UI And then Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home hell at least ask once what is this PM Yeah PM Yeah but its not a positive thing UI Its a very positive thing if you see like that PM Well you know its its handy its ergonomic but its a banana ID Well dont forget well dont for dont forget who were targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young UI Youngsters ME Actually maybe Yeah I change the question PM Yeah but it says I I would buy this so ID Not telling that you are young ID Li li like a teenager for instance PM No its I ID Okay youre youre crazy teenager and you like fun things PM I would buy S s Still I Id say two UI You want to flaunt ID Yeah UI You with your girlfriend or something ID Yeah you want to show the beautiful banana you have UI Or might be it does some other kind of thing but Uh yeah crazy PM I dont think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control really ID Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know PM I can say maybe there is a market for it I dunno ID So you say two PM Yeah UI I say five ID F I d I say five ID You say ID So whats the new question UI And you have saved it ME So yeah upload the Yeah its two different situations UI Youll have to reload ID Uh yeah I think so PM Okay so it depends if uh If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro if that was like my limit maybe I would buy it ME If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one ID Yeah thats two different question PM Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana UI Theyre not going to be as And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah ID Ugly PM And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use UI Yeah ME So ME What now UI S I go slightly up ID I stick to five ME What range PM Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno UI Six ME Six PM Um ID W we have six five Three So we are six five four Yeah PM Id give it Id give it a I give it a four now ME Six ME Six UI Six five four ME Six so its uh five point five or less ID So So and last question will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana UI Okay ID Um zero ID No uh we cant ID So one ME Actually yeah I we Five ID Well if ID No uh lets say Ill put two PM Yeah PM Id say three I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible PM If it was change my remote control of my DVD player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh cause its really bad but uh Id say a three ID Its for the TV UI Ill still give it five UI Yeah ID Two three five two three fi and two ME You are romantic really ME I would say two UI So its somewhere three point five I think ID So its r Yeah three point five ME Who is the outlier ME Wh wh you said five UI No I said five ID No no you say five he is the outlier ID Okay just just do a sum ME I dont know if its a No because there are more yeah we shouldnt sum like that PM Its not very promising but you know were not young trendsetters ID Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah ME Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually UI Mmhmm ME Otherwise we wouldnt we will not sell PM Is there some some formula youre using that says you have to sum them up ME Uh no I didnt anything PM Well just leave it at that then UI Oops ME Yeah the uh Yeah ID So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling ID We can had uh have a out of these numbers which which is that well we should go for it ME Do you want me to sum o I think its not S Actually whats the differen Too expensive ID Problem with connectors PM No PM I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it so UI Yeah its its funny ID Okay ID So lets move uh lets move on UI Yeah sure ID Okay now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay ID So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet ID Um well we are going to calculate the production costs ID We should we should be below twelve point five ID So I already uh put some pu some numbers here okay ID We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing ID So it appears that there were things that we didnt thought about ID Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells UI Mmhmm PM Well we decided against the solar cells so You mean charging it by shaking the banana ID Oh yeah finally we say no UI Solar cells yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we said no to that ID Okay so lets lets go lets go let go through all the lines ID So hand dynamo ID This something we didnt thought about ID But Yeah UI I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing ID Yeah UI Yeah UI To bring the cost Yeah ID Okay so we we stick to battery one ID No kinetic also ID I dont I dont see the difference between kinetic and dynamo PM Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually Yeah ID Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana UI Yeah ID Crazy ID Okay ID So those banana is falling ID Lets go ahead ID So we we st only have one for battery UI Okay ID Uh then for electronics um so I didnt put anything for the UI So we have the regular chip on the print which is one ID Yeah ID Yeah UI And thats it ID Okay ID No so we hin Yeah so one UI And we have sample speaker UI Yeah UI Yeah UI the cost of that is very high ID Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing PM Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we were not using that were just using the the very beep simple beep that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything ID So we are The beep UI Uhhuh ID Thats what Okay so Ill remove it UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm PM So Yeah PM I say that Yeah ID S So dont we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing UI And we have sev Yeah ID So Yeah maybe UI So we well put some extras if there is something ID Well see later PM Mm ID Okay so in for the case um I put single curved UI Okay UI To reduce the cost its okay PM Well wait a second no its its double curved its got a c its uh Well d yeah its monotonic but its got but if you hold it if you hold it that way thats two curved one on this side one on that side but theyre opposite sides ID Because we have two things UI Oh its got all the directions so dont worry ID No UI Its got a direction ID Well ID What a what i if I put one here PM This is actually I mean this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you Yeah ID Yeah so lets put one here in the then instead of single oka all right UI Okay UI Okay ID So we stick to plastic it cost nothing UI Yeah UI Thats right PM Well no didnt we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it ID No its too no ID Its too expensive PM Well when okay ID Were already at eleven PM Well we well come back well come back and see if we can fit it in ID Okay so I put rubber one ID Okay so special colour yellow PM Yeah ID Uh for the interface we have We have three UI We dont have any push buttons PM No we have two push buttons UI No that is a scroll wheel itself itll be put in that PM Huh ID No no ID We have two scroll and we have three push buttons UI Ah okay okay PM Uh UI Okay okay ME Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two because there is another chip here PM Okay its gonna have to be plastic ID And No its no chip ID This is just radio frequency UI Yeah ID Th This is no chip ME Yeah but you need Fo i it does nothing actually UI No UI Theres no chip there UI It just emits the signal ID Its just Yeah UI And the receiver accepts it and thats it ID No UI Just se sends the signal thats it ID Just only PM Its a recharger thing and uh Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class ID Okay w we didnt think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons ID Yeah so Yeah PM You know PM So I mean if were if were over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that ID Okay ID So no LCD so for we have no button supplements right UI Yep UI No ID Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no these are these are for colours co and special forms special colours and special materials PM Yeah PM No were not we dont need anything special for the buttons ID So Okay so we are over budget UI Yeah UI So first thing which we should take care of is instead of rubber let it be plastic PM Make it plastic instead of rubber ID Yeah PM And then were basically o on budget except for you know ten cents UI And uh that much money will be required for the base station which is not there ID Yeah PM Yeah ID So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing PM Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic UI Yeah UI Thats right UI So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything whichll go Thats right ID Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff PM Does that include charging circuitry and everything ID Yeah maybe ID Okay good UI Yeah ID Wha Excellent PM So what do we do with the extra profits ID Um well invest in R and D PM Okay PM The next fruit ID Yeah ID So well were under the the the cost ID So we can go to through to project evaluation ME Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy ME Would yeah would buy ID Sorry PM No we have a product which none of us would buy ME Yeah because th th the evaluation project Ah would buy yeah ID Which is different ID Which is different ID None of us will buy it PM No its people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it ME Massively yeah PM Were n yeah PM Were not in Milan or Paris ME Yeah ME Okay ME Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times so PM Actually there were a lot of Thats cause Im sick of Milan ID This is a battery ME And you said the lowest ID This is what we which you can mm It did yeah UI S Detachable battery ME Yeah for the batteries Mmhmm ID Extra battery yeah ID Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didnt know really what to say here PM Okay so um project process ID If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say ID So I dont I dont I dont understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example ID Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact PM Yeah ID Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen not that much PM I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity ID Oh yeah its really creative PM And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people were targeting PM We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it ID Yeah UI They like that UI Mmhmm ID Yeah maybe we should go through yeah an uh evaluation PM Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless UI Biased ID So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well do you like to have a banana as a remote control PM Yeah PM Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well to see you know how to how to market this thing UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Yeah PM Cause you know if well I mean maybe you dont wanna give all your kids their own remote because theyll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a TV for each kid then you know banana remote control could be fun for them as well PM Might have to draw a face on it ID Mmhmm PM So but I think thats something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market ID Yep ID Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ID Dunno oranges UI Yeah UI The cost of the thing can be made more than might be UI Because I think its just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to PM Yeah PM I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that were using inside Im not sure really how complicated our um our needs are UI Interface UI Mmhmm PM I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that ID Hmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ME So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on TV UI Thats right ME The complexity shouldnt be much higher UI Yeah ME For you said if it good for DVD then I would Bye PM And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff that would be rather cool PM I think thats actually something that should be in version two is the ability to you know to control things other than the TV and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room UI Integrate UI Mmhmm ID Okay ID Very good UI So What else ID So Well done ID I think we we can go home UI Okay UI Home UI Happily satisfied ID Yeah ID Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate UI Mmhmm PM Yep ID Okay so thanks very much UI Thank you PM Okay ID Bye PM Thank you,"The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting."
PM Now what ID Kay hello everybody ID Uh I guess you all know what is it about you all received the email I guess ID Uh we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control ID So Im going to be the project manager of this uh project ID And uh so Im present myself ID Im Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself ID So I dunno you can starts PM Okay so my name is Petre PM You can call me Petre or Peter if you like PM I dont care ID Okay ME Uh my names Bob Mor ID And you are ID In the project PM Uh in the project Im supposed to be the technic ME Oh sorry ME Kay ME So my names Bob Morris ME Im the Marketing Expert for this project PM Bob okay ME Bob yeah UI My name is Hamed Getabdar and uh Im going to be Interface Designer in this project PM Okay ID So uh so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project ID We are talking about the project plan and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on and yeah ID So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting ID Um ID So what is the goal of this project ID Is to design a new remote control ID So it should be of course new and original and um it should be trendy and user friendly ID That mean its a very challenging project and uh uh ID So w its we will try to do our best and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy ID So um So whats uh what are we going to do during this all this project ID So its more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way ID Um ID Yeah and everything is will be like this ID Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project ID So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here ID So uh PM Okay ID For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it ID Mm ID Uh ID So uh So I will ask you all to do the same PM Okay ID Just to get used to the whiteboard PM So probably I would try to try to draw the animal PM Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal PM I I th I think I should ID Yeah yeah you can draw the picture of course ME Yeah go ahead PM Okay so PM Um PM Okay American um PM Um PM I would use the bird PM So I tried to sketch it out PM I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it but ah PM Can you recognise it as a bird PM Okay its your turn to Oh its okay ME Okay okay ME So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat ID Oh ME Thats its head ME Um I probably like cats the most because theyre cuddly and furry and uh playful ME Okay UI I dunno if I should go with this ME Thanks UI If it is enough line UI Im sorry ME Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something PM Yeah PM I should get used to the tool so UI Okay PM Oh just wait a little bit PM C could we put it here to make it as straight as possible PM Ah probably not UI They should be remote PM Okay it it works like this ME Uh thats better UI Okay thanks ME Your lapel microphones fallen off PM Are you lefthanded UI No PM Oh pity UI Okay UI Should I clean UI Okay I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful so if I want to write it here I think I can ID Never mind UI Oh PM Ah its maybe better if you leave it ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Maybe we should just continue ID Yeah ME Yeah dont worry about it ID no worry ME No UI Okay PM You wont draw them or ID You can draw it if you want UI I dunno if I can PM Just try PM I would like to see how it looks like UI Okay UI It may be like a cow or I dunno whatever UI Im not good very good in drawing UI Okay so this is very Its a bird I think UI I dunno what is it PM No I think its clear UI Four UI Okay UI Mmhmm UI Mm UI Yeah UI Im shameful Yeah ME Oh thats good its good PM Its okay PM Its in its indeed beautiful ID Good ME Yeah and strong UI Okay PM Okay PM Bob PM Have to remember it PM Bob ID So good um So lets talk about money ID Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro ID And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro ID And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world ID So n not only for Switzerland but for the world ID Uh ID So um ID The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro PM Per unit I guess ID Yeah of course PM Y oh okay ID Um so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control and any idea ID So if you have some experience good or bad with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea ID Anything PM Okay ME Well from experience um Ive had remote controls in the past that have had very theyve had lots and lots of buttons and theyve been very small and its been very hard to to to use because theres so many buttons and you know its very hard to see which buttons do what and the buttons are very small and very hard to press ME Um and and normally you only every use you know on a TV remote you only ever use mostly you know f four or f six buttons ID Mm PM Oh ME Um ME So its frustrated me in the past th that PM Okay I have also some points uh PM Maybe two points PM Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room its its probably worth to to have something like uh back light ID Yeah PM And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room so that if if its in the day it doesnt need to be back lighted because it works on the battery so PM So something like this PM And the second thing f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control PM But I prefer like a potentialmeter or something like ID Yeah ME Ah okay ME Okay PM You know some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume but something which Yeah but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down or or make a high volume ID Okay UI Mmhmm ME Okay n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels or is that Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah also if y when you take the the remote control for example on the table you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud and you have a heart attack PM Ah n PM If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream PM Yeah f It depends what what you feel about that ID Okay ME Yeah PM Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards but if you have some more notes on that ID Yeah so you can Do you have something UI Uh I Yeah just a simple experience UI I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves because remote control working with infrared rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune ID Yeah thats true ID Yeah without obstacles and PM Okay ID Okay PM Um ID Lets continue ID I have a meeting in five minutes so maybe we should hurry ME Okay PM Okay just a second ID Um ID So we will close uh this meeting ID So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes ID Um ID Uh ID The So I will ask you to do some work ID Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control start to to have new idea and read about Yeah PM Which i which is Hamed UI Mm PM Okay ME Hes the Industrial Designer ME No youre the Industrial Designer UI Yeah PM Uh I am the Technical Designer I dunno which one uh v ID Oh ME Yeah I think thats the first ID Industry and Oh UI Uhhuh ME ID ME Industrial Designer ME And the second one is the User Interface Designer UI Mmhmm PM User Interf Okay ME And then last ones marketing which is me ID Yeah PM Okay so Im the first one ID So um For the User Interface Designer which is Hamed um uh you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control UI Mmhmm PM I see UI Okay ID And for the Marketing uh Manager I dunno okay which is Bob uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control ID Um you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach PM Sign ID Yep finished ID So I see you in thirty minutes ME Great okay PM Okay UI Okay thanks ME Thanks guys ME Bye UI Bye ID Thank you PM Uh,"The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal. The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes, focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce, as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes."
ID So um nice to see you again ID Uh ID So uh ID Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes ID Uh so we will see our three presentations ID Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device ME Okay can I have the laptop over here or ID Yep ID Oh I dont think so ID I think you have to come here ME Okay ME Have to get up ID I dunno ID I think it should stay ME Excuse me PM Yeah thats it ME Okay ID Should stay in the square here ME Okay ID Oh maybe ME Okay so basically Im gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control ID Oh you can put it here ID Oh thats okay its jus Hmm ME Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects ME Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to you know um play with remote controls and also to complete after theyd done that to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they dont like in remote controls ME So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users dont like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market ME Um they you know seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on found that rem remote the remote controls that theyd used in the past were ugly ME Completely ugly ME Um they they didnt match the operating behaviour of the user that is you know the the way users use remote controls when theyre watching TV ME Um that the layout of the remote controls didnt match they way that they used it ME Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls ME Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control ME And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control ME Um and you can see theyre used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average um while the users watching TV ME Um the closest button that was used well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button um which was used fourteen times per hour followed by the volume button which was four times per hour um all the other all the other um buttons such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used you know l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour ME Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them you know which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control ME And basically they came they said the channel volume and power buttons had the highest relevance to users um note that only power was very infrequently used it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance ME Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh werent very important to them um and they used them very infrequently a as well ME So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls ME And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it ME Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control especially when theres many buttons and its a you know a c a a unintuitive interface ME Um and then thirdly they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury ME We also asked some users about some specific features that theyd like to see in the on the remote control ME In particular do they want an LCD d display and secondly do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control ME Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes ME They want these features they want these high technology features ME Um for instance ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes they want these features ME Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control ME So I guess it depends on where were focusing our our market ME Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics um I think were focusing on the younger younger um target demographic and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control ME Thats my dic thats my presentation ME Thank you ID Thank you UI Okay ID So um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device ID So uh Pet Peter can you talk say something about that PM Well okay yeah PM Yeah but the user user interface is responsible ID No UI B you think uh I Im User Interface Manager ID Ah PM Okay so ID Sorry Im Sorry UI Okay ID Sorry UI Okay UI If I could go there with this cable PM Youre scaring me with LCD man PM And speech recognition in remote unit it will be very e expensive ME Yeah its true but you know theyre features that users want so its And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote PM Yeah PM Yeah PM At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally UI Sh okay ME It is true UI Wheres delete button UI Okay UI Oh Im sorry UI Okay ME Thats the wrong one I think ID Yeah its still Bob Morris UI Oh UI Presentation three PM Because you cancelled it ID Yeah you should have put yes PM Yeah UI Oh ID Click on yes ID yeah PM Yep UI Okay so here is my presentation about technical function design UI I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together UI Okay uh first what is a remote control UI Simply its a device as you know for uh for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device UI And the main idea we dont use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device UI Uh i it has different blocks different blocks UI Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands UI And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands UI And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever to uh r to realise the command UI Okay uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control UI They are based on infrared uh waves or uh uh radio waves PM You still want me the presentation UI There are two different uh uh solutions I mean UI This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves infrared or radio waves UI And uh also as uh I understood and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob uh uh presentation people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button UI So for the electronic part working and interfacing with button we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options and showing o something on TV and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control UI And uh personal preferences uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you dont need to tune it any way UI And uh uh again using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred as I see UI Okay UI That was my presentation ME Okay ME I have a question UI Uhhuh ME Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home UI Uh I dont think so because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency UI So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home ME Okay ID So can we use any any frequency PM Yeah it should be okay ID We have the right to use any frequency UI Uh no but as I know there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff for designing this circuit UI We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range and for this range we dont need to ask any permission ID Okay ID And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control for example ID And so do they have the same frequency or UI Uh for this Im not uh I I dont know the solution but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave so the only your TV can understand it Yeah identification code inside the The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem ID Okay ID A kind of identification okay PM Yeah f uh I know about this since its my its exactly my field so ID So Yeah PM Its uh kind of handshaking uh when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your TV then then its like an handshaking protocol with your your remote ID So Okay PM So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the TV set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen PM Well it can be a problem sometimes but most of the time it works okay UI A specific uh remote control has a specific f Mm PM Yeah but we we dont have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy PM Its worth to buy ID Hmm PM And they have these problems solved so ME Okay PM So we dont have to think about these UI Mmhmm ID Okay ME Okay ID So maybe you can talk about the function and Open PM Yes PM I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that Im supposed to use in this uh uh in this company PM I was used to use Linux before so PM But I tried to tried to break through this too I guess PM Mm PM Ah PM Okay PM How to make it big ID Slide show UI Five PM Slide show PM Okay thanks ID It should work so you can PM Okay PM Oh so I will speak about working design PM Thats the first slide PM Uh what uh I have to do PM A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didnt work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the IR circuits and so on so Im currently looking what is available on the web PM And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards after after our discussion if we have some contacts in some companies so which can report on what is going on there so I would be glad if you can tell me about them ID Mm ID Yeah PM So you know PM Uh okay findings thats the point that Im working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now but the prices I read are high ME Mmhmm PM So I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the TV do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on but you know when you are not close to the TV you probably wont need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infrared control instead of RW but we will discuss it later maybe UI Mmhmm ID Hmm PM Uh PM Components to use Im not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit PM It depends uh on whether we will use the LCD and mainly the speech recognition because the speech rec Yeah ME Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an OEM component for the radio wave circuit or are we planning to construct our own circuit board PM No no no no no PM This we this we buy I think because its rather cheap nowadays and its not worth to construct ourselves ME Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and Okay PM Exactly PM But Im not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition PM This I prefer that we should make ourselves ME Okay PM But it depends whether we take a decision to use it PM Same thing PM Its fairly expensive to use these circuits PM So speech recognition well LCD its okay because its common nowadays to use LCD so I agree on using any kind of LCD less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit ID Yeah PM But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer you know UI Mm ID Yeah ID So what do you think would be the price it would be out of range PM Yeah Im Oh ID Or it would be maybe feasible PM I was not thinking too much about the price PM But if we use the LCD uh even the radio frequency communication with the TV set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff it should be okay PM If we decide to use the speech recognition then we probably could struggle but well see afterwards ID Okay PM It depends of you if if the ME or UID Im sorry about the names I dont really know uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic these things it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic devices price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that so ID Mm ME Okay PM We will discuss it afterwards PM Oh this is nothing PM This is just my notes on what to use PM And uh my personal preference is yes I would like also preferably to use RW circuit but from the point of view uh of the design and price I would stick to IRs PM Thats my opinion PM Uh I mean if infrared uh circuit not not the radio frequency ID Why ID Because its simpler PM Because because the the range where you can use it is fair ID Yeah ID Mm PM Its okay I think PM And the price is fairly cheap for this ID Okay ID Its a a price matter PM Well depends ID Yeah PM Jus just the price ID Mm PM Otherwise I dont care what I put there because its the chip which I buy or which we buy ID Okay PM So I I I think its o y o ME What how much more expensive ME Are we talking three times more expensive ME Or ten times more expensive PM Well three to three to five ME Or Okay PM N not ten times but it depends what what we Yeah ME Yeah yeah ME Thats still a lot ME I think its its probably not worth spending the extra money because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infrared so people dont expect anything other than infrared ID Hmm ID Yeah ID Yeah ME So its not worth spending the extra money ID Well I oh On the other side we want to have something new PM Th they are used to use it when they can see the TV so I dont know ME Yeah ID You know where we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it ME Yeah ID But maybe ME But I think based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above you know the difference between infrared or radio waves ID Okay ME So I think were better off spending money in the usability phase PM You the user interface and management man uh Uh okay thats it for me ID Okay UI Mm ID Yeah ME Okay ID Okay thank you Peter PM Kay ID So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control ME Mm ID Um first um they say thats uh about something about t teletext ID Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date ID Outdated ID And uh Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home and actually its not useful to have teletext ID Um ID So I think we can avoid the teletext ID Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for TV not for DVD and other devices because it make it it makes its too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on TV on the only specific TV remote control PM I agree ID The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company ID So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable ID Uh uh Its That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company which is uh we put fashion of in electronics ID So when people see the the remote control they should say oh its from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company ID So um So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control ID So mm are we going to use LCD speech recognition ID Uh ME Well should we start with just the core the basic functions that we need ME And then we can move on to the more advanced features ID Yeah UI Mm UI Yes ID Maybe maybe PM Okay so the available things are LCD the buttons and everything PM Uh radio frequency depends PM And well the recognition it depends on you guys ID Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control PM You should probably speak ID I mean what do Yeah PM Okay ME Okay well I mean the obvious one is changing channels ID Yeah UI Yeah ID I think we should stick on very useful functions because we want less button ME Yeah ID So yeah ME Yeah okay ID So turning channel of course ID Volume setting PM Uh just one note to the chan channel changing PM Do we will we use only two buttons or or like numbered buttons PM I mean those nine plus one or two ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ID I think it would be a b Yeah PM Because its many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number UI Mm ME Yeah I Ah yeah ID On the other side we have more and more channels and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want its Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens like uh Yeah UI Yeah PM Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons UI Yeah yeah at least nine ten button PM Like ten plus five plus one plus one minus or something ID Maybe something like that PM Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno ID Uh UI Or Or something ID Maybe Oh I dont know ID Oh ID Maybe we could have key buttons like uh discovery channe like documentary channel and movies channel and And inside this this thing you can move maybe switch PM You mean like hierarchical structure UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Like categorising channels ID If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after youve you plus plus plus UI Mmhmm PM Okay so s Oh sorry UI Okay ID I It just an idea ID I dont know what you think about that but PM So it requires the use of LCD probably to to tell you Okay so Ill make a note on LCD ME To have some feedback ID Yeah probably yeah yeah UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ME We could maybe also c um incorporate Petres idea of the um slider for the volume with the channel UI Okay ID Okay ME So we c you could quickly just through many channels PM Yeah PM Like roller for the Yeah ME For the channels perhaps PM Okay ID Anything else ME So weve got channel and volume ME Um ID Yeah PM So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ME I think so ME I think basically the core functions we want and then more advanced ones ID Yeah ID What about the settings of the TV ID Because its button we dont use very often but its we need it anyway UI So uh we dont have any uh we dont have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we dont have any access to the to the TV design or we can change some design ID So Yeah yeah ME Yeah UI Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah PM On the screen you mean UI Yeah b Not on the control on the screen on the TV screen PM Not on the control but on the screen PM Well this would avoid LCD then ME I dont Oh I dont but I dont think were were the ones UI And then Mmhmm ME I mean this remote control were developing is a generic control for all TVs I think ID I dont know if its possible to to watch something on TV Yeah PM Oh PM W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the TV to to to print these things ID Yeah UI Mmhmm PM Well it wi it will be still more expensive but for the LCD and this stuff is no problem in the price UI Mmhmm ME Okay ID So what are we doing with the settings ID Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons so ID Maybe with the LCD we can do something with less buttons but Mm UI Yeah ME But then you dont want to make the LCD display too complicated at the same time ME I mean theres always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some Yeah PM Two TVs ID Yeah ID Oh yeah PM Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode ID Oh the PM Or I dunno PM Or like children and grandfathers mode and the well the the user not the user the man mana TV manager mode ME Yeah UI Mm ME Okay PM Ah I dunno UI Mmhmm ME So we have five minutes left ID Yeah ME Um PM Uh ME So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that theyre required ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ME Its just how to a Yeah PM Yeah ID We should hide them somewhere PM Hide them okay ID In the menus of the LCD or in the back of the remote control or something like that ME Okay ME Yeah ME Uh okay what else PM Um ME I mean a power buttons obviously uh required PM Yes PM This I was thinking PM Do we need a power button at all PM Should should shouldnt we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it PM Because generally Yes ID Its its a kind of setting I think ID It should fit in those settings functions UI Mm UI Settings ID Because its not a very current useful function ME Uh well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the TV on and off ID No I think its after after five minutes or something a timer I I think no PM Well I I uh You dont need to every five minutes to keep it alive ME But if youre watching TV for two hours you dont want your TV to turn off after five five minute I mean based on our usability studies again um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button PM Uh probably PM Okay so we should keep this button UI Yeah ID Oh okay yeah UI Mmhmm ME Um you know it was nine out of ten re relevance PM Okay so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the LCD and all the buttons and stuff we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the TV and if you close it it will turn off the TV ID Yeah ID Yeah PM If if you like this Because well its maybe question for you t Yeah ME Okay ME B Okay ME I think we need to concentrate on the you know the major usage of the th of the control which is you sit down you turn on your TV you change channels you change the volume you turn the TV off UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Um and all the other f functionality is not used very often ID So s yeah UI Yeah they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this ID Yeah ME Yeah UI Like covering cu ID On the back or For what PM I mean like the Yeah but since we have the LCD we didnt need too much button too many buttons UI Yeah like mobile phone covering PM Um okay just um the decision of the power button PM Should we make it a button or some some something which would be Uh power button ME I think a button UI A button is better ME I think it should be a bu Its own button on the front ID Ah oh yeah yeah PM If it if its a button or Okay UI Yeah ID Yeah a button yeah I guess so UI Mm PM Okay one nice big button PM Old fashioned button to satisfy the grandmothers PM Hmm ME Okay ID So any other suggestions or functions PM Mm ME S What about things like the clock and um timers PM Do we still have the time PM I I just wonder ID Yeah we have still one or two minutes to talk yeah PM Okay PM Oh PM Well what w what was the question UI Clock or Yes ME Uh um you know some func some features on the control to display a time or t to display Probably not ID Usually its already on TV or something like that PM Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote no ID Yeah PM Because if if the TV turns on itself it well you know if the time The timer should be there UI Mm ID Yeah ID Yeah ID If we if we add the time we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that and is it very useful ID I mean are users wants to have the time on the on the remote UI Mm ID This is the question ID Is it useful UI Yes ME Its a questi yeah its a tradeoff ID W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler its is better ME Kay PM Ah yeah ME Okay simple PM Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the TV well And based on your Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote ME Very yeah okay very occasionally ME But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often but Yeah UI Mm ME Yeah thats okay thats true ME Okay so no time button ID No time on UI And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands or ME Okay PM Yes yes ID I think Yeah UI I I thin I think it will not take lots of place we just need a microphone and the software so and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and its not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone UI It doesnt take that much place and also that much It doesnt cost that much PM Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life then PM If we use the speech recognition ID So maybe we think we can think more about that and discuss that maybe last time next time UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID And uh yeah now the meeting room is busy ID Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one PM and so we should leave ID Uh ID So um ID So now we are going for for a small lunch ID Its uh funded by the company ID And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works ID And uh I will do the minutes ID And uh you are going to work on your individual works ID And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on ME Okay cool ID Thank you everybody ME Okay Thank you UI Thanks,The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements. The marketing expert also found that younger users want an LCD display and a remote capable of speech recognition. The interface specialist discussed the interior workings of a remote and stated a preference for using radio waves over infra-red technology. The industrial designer discussed particular components that a remote could include. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and initiated a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote they will produce.
ID Hello uh this meeting we are its fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control ME Hello PM Mmhmm UI Hello ID Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision ID So uh we will have again three presentation from all of you and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions ID So who wants to start UI I s No no you you can start ID Okay ME Okay ME Okay Ill start ID So start uh Uh ME Can you open my presentation please ME Im number four ME Trend ID This one ME Yep ME Can you pass the mouse please ME Oh okay thats fine ID Turn ME Okay ME Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results weve had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world ME Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan ME Um so f from our market research basically weve come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel um as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority ME Um fancy is is is is the you know highest priority ID Hmm PM Hmm ME Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative ME Um so this is t number two priority but its two times less important as the fancy criteria ME Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control ME From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan um weve discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes shoes and furniture ME So Im pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category ME And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy ID Okay ME Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way PM What does it mean spongy ME Uh sort of um squishy ME Um PM Like soft or something ME Yeah soft like a uh like a sponge ID Like a sponge ME I dont know ID Yeah PM Okay ME Yeah PM I will see ME Um so in conclusion we need a our remote control needs to be something thats really fancy um has lots of technolog tech technology in it ME Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel PM Okay ME And that its easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company ME Um ID Yeah uh yeah ME Thats it ID Easy to use is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing ID Its less important right ME Less important ME So um fanciness first and then two ti you know half as important as that is technology technology and half important as technology is easy to use ID Yeah yeah ID Okay ME So ID So Hamed can you UI Yeah UI The second one UI Could you please show the presentation number three ID Mmhmm PM I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature PM Well see UI Yeah ID Um ID Number UI Three ID Three ID This one UI Yes UI Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second UI Uh n n no its the first one UI The second one ID So its not this one UI Uh yeah UI Okay UI Okay UI So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use UI I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy but okay we can discuss about it uh later UI Um generally generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something in my opinion uh the first feature is just to be easy to use UI So the more frequent buttons should be larger they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control UI And uh s uh I can conclude like this that we shouldnt need to learn how to use it UI It should be we shouldnt need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control UI Okay UI So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think its better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control and they should be bigger in size UI Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand UI It should not be completely like uh a cube UI It should be it should have round edge so uh then its easier PM Exactly UI And maybe uh just like some toys some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand UI And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesnt like to buy lots of battery it should not uh consume lots of energy UI Okay UI And my personal p uh preference is uh as I said uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button like mobile phone UI Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control UI And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this UI Uh UI And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier UI Not on remote control UI I dunno if I can explain well UI But uh just inside UI For example a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb UI So it can be another uh preference UI And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good UI I know that it consumes lots of energy but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy UI And I think its good because its something new and usually young people like something new UI So it may not be very useful but because its new people may buy it UI Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something UI Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company or UI Okay UI Thats mine ID Okay PM Uh okay so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed but bad news from Bob obviously because spongy design I dont like it as Okay so could you please Fabien open it ID Yeah PM Im person two PM And which one uh probably the first one PM Im not sure but check the first one PM I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board but Yeah thats it ID This one yeah PM Just Its only this slide PM Yeah PM This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or Ill just Yeah seven seven inch T TFT screen which is good news for us since we wanted to include a display there ME Inch PM Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme ID Oh PM This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view ID Oops PM Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape no uh Im not speaking about the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device PM So there will be some circuit uh for the power PM So say power circuit here PM Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there we must use additional source of energy which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything PM I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition and its okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells so PM So no problem PM There can be also solar cell PM Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design PM So at least seven to seven UI Mmhmm PM It depends where you put your screen because the screen is uh seven inch so it depends on you where where you put it PM It doesnt matter PM Um its just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere PM So this will be TFT PM And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone which is somewhere say here PM Interface to the microphone PM Then the graphical card uh for the TFT and the third unit is the IR PM The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infrared unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infrared including all the stuff inside so it will be very cheap for us PM So infrared here PM So the once again the overall requirements seven to seven centimetres for the board which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size and the TFT which is seven inches PM Um I have to check what I wanted to Uh from my point of view I dont care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device ID Can you fit any uh for example a TFT or any electronic device in a spongy thing or is there any problem for that ID For example put electronic card on a spongy thing I can I can imagine it could be a problem PM A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape basically PM But we have to take care of the TFT ID Yep PM Well sponginess PM Maybe it a good feature since it takes if its around the TFT then its good because its just keeps it safe I dunno ID Okay ID So Okay UI Well maybe it can have two shells a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside ME So So Ca Can I ask a question ID Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around PM Well its maybe related to the UI ID maybe after ID Yeah PM A Yeah thats all from me ME This seven inch TFT screen how big is it in reality PM Yeah PM Well seven to seven inches ME So like that PM Yes ME Thats quite big ME Uh uh have we decided that were gonna use this TFT screen PM Yeah but To be honest I was Yeah honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially but its seven inches ID No I dont think its seven by seven I think its seven the diagonal is seven ID Usually when they say seven inch I think its the diagonal ME But I mean even even that is like this big UI Yeah yes ID Yeah ID I dunno I dun I dun One each ID But yeah ME Yeah PM But I I think we can we can cut it ME You can cut the TFT screen PM Yeah no no problem because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth ID Lets go PM So Yeah but no problem to to me to cut the screen ID So lets cut the TFT UI Mm ME Okay so Okay PM So so for the same price we have four screens now ID Mm ID These technical engineers huh ME So whats the size of the device PM Ah well this is like this is almost nothing PM Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something ME Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Is it Can you hold that or PM Yeah but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that you know PM Because if its t too small we can we can lose it at home you know ID What user wants ID He wants a small remote control or UI Uh ME Yeah a small c control that they can hold in hand ID Uh uh with big buttons PM I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something UI Yes ID Its difficult ID A sm So maybe you can finish your presentation and afterwards we will discuss about all this ME But is something thats seven centimetres square e easy to hold PM W I I think so PM I if the roller buttons are on the side you dont have to catch it like that but just like this and you know follow follow Well thats thats no task for me but well seven to seven at least yeah but Oh okay UI Maybe this ME Okay PM Okay thanks ID Thats it ID Okay ID So ID No ID Uh so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions ID Uh first I think energy its a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries for example or something like that ID Because can we have LCD and speech recognition with battery and its also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device PM Not J uh just a point to the energy th things PM If we use the batteries and the additional so solar cell then its okay for L uh speech recognition and LCD so no problem in energy I think ID Okay ID So Okay PM But we have to use the solar cell UI So but Mmhmm PM Otherwise not ID Uh like but using how many batteries for example ID Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery Okay PM Yeah I was thinking just common AA cells ID Uh one two Okay PM So like three to five centimetres I dunno exactly but ME So if we use s solar cells um where is the sun if someones watching TV inside PM S Uh d doesnt need to be sun PM It its just the daylight you know ID The television lights ME Okay PM Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control wont be in the in the room like this where there is light only when when there are people but ID At least when there is TV you can get light from the TV PM Yeah from the T I dont think its enough uh UI Yeah ID I dunno ME Okay ID Okay ID Mm PM Ah its a its a compromise no ID At least its new and maybe technology New technology PM Yeah thats why I wanted to to include the speech recognition because you wanted all the new things ME Its its quite innovative yes ID Yeah UI Hmm ID Um ME And if you watch TV outside its very useful ID So I think before talking about the other thing its important thing its the case ID Uh what what are gonna be the size because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on ID For example for the for the LCD if we choose to have a small device we cannot use this um a such a a a screen PM Uh the s the screen is okay but the board uh thats the problem PM Well what what would you guess as a shape PM Or what what would be the shape UI Mm UI I think I think their being uh large or small is not important UI The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily UI So lets say an average size okay and it should not be very heavy also PM Mm UI And I prefer to is it shouldnt have a uniform shape so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner maybe maybe UI So we c its like like some joysticks UI You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because its its designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape UI So the general shape should be like this UI I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large UI So uh seven not seven but lets say five by ten its I think its thats my opinion PM Okay ME Which is the same area UI Its easier UI Yeah ME Could you re could you redesign your board PM Okay PM Five to ten ME Oh five five centimetres by ten centimetres PM Well that Yeah right ME Yeah PM Yeah I think its feasib Well one um um How could we do it PM We could put the board next to well under the LCD and for example make the LCD be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand UI Mmhmm PM Like holding something and the LCD to be just on top of it you know somehow PM Well But maybe lets stick to the s spongy thing like one unit ID Oh ID Ive I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller LCD if its possible PM Well fi five to ten it would be feasible UI Mm PM Okay so five to ten I I think its its feasible ID Okay ID So we are agree with a small LCD PM Ill make it UI Or uh or I dont know but I dont want to now invent something new because we didnt discuss about it PM Fo Five by ten UI So using some LCDs we can touch so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh I dunno the name LCD responding to fingers ID Yeah UI Touching the screen UI Something like Mm like tactile ID Tactile or something yeah ME Mm touch screen ID Touch screen yeah UI So But for now if we dont want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better because A smaller s Okay ID Yeah ID The problem is we have a limit in a month of time so we cannot do something very new PM Mmhmm ID So lets go for a small LCD ME So Well its its definitely the obvious choice with the colour of our company PM Okay so Yeah so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out ID Yeah okay ID So five by s ten PM Hmm ID Um so what about so the case we talked about ID Um something easy to use you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way like with fruit and vegetable and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on now can we do that ID My first idea is because our colour is more yellow and the it should be easy to take in a hand I thought about banana or something like that which is fruits and A big banana PM Seven to ten banana PM Okay PM Rather mango or something or ID Um ID Yeah ME I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ID Yeah ID But its just an idea ID I dunno what you think about but Yeah ID I dunno if it can fit with the technology ID You are the specialists of that PM You mean banana PM Well but If its If it If the banana is big enough PM Then yes ID So Yeah and The screen has to be square PM But if you want to look at the screen no PM Well Well it can be whatever you want UI I think this is not good ID Or it can be like a a shape quite uh with curves PM But if its square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just ID It could PM But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches so ID Yeah UI Mm PM Its like more more expensive to have shape like that PM But I dont care PM You know if we fit this requirement ME Well Id like a shaped screen ME I think thats more important than saving a bit of money on on the TFT screen PM Okay Yeah m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one ID Okay okay UI Mm ID Yeah ID Yeah it should remember banana but its not doesnt have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana PM But Like modified banana okay PM Well it well stick to banana or ID So we are agree with the banana thing UI Okay ME Yeah bananas good ID Okay PM Okay ME Okay PM Mmmm ID So the last point we decided its infrared I guess UI Yeah I think infrared PM Yeah yeah ID Everybodys agreed PM Sure ID Uh so thats it I think about the concepts ID You have other thing to add to this point or uh no ID So uh about the user interface so we are going to use LCD ID In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons ID I dont know what we are going to do with that ID You talked about the buttons on the side Mm what PM Like like peeling of the banana you s It would be cool yeah UI Yeah peeling of the banana PM Peeling of the banana you know should should discover the other buttons which are hidden UI Yeah UI Mm ID Yeah ID Okay ID And you mean the first layer would be spongy UI Yeah PM First layer obviously spo Yeah w Its its like silly but the people will really appreciate it yeah I think ID So Is it is it possible to do that ID It would be a great idea but is it possible technically UI Uh Mmhmm ID Like doing a spongy layer of the banana and you open it ME I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then its easy to make that you know to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and I think for sure ID Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah some Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface USB interface as in the in uh digital camera ID Yeah UI If you see its like peeling UI You open a plastic cover and you see some USB interfaces some some interfaces for adaptor UI So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover its like peeling a banana UI So something like this ID Yeah but do you see that as a rigid thing or like like a banana something very soft you can open like banana or PM Well is it possible to make it soft UI Yeah yeah yeah its a lic like a plastic cover so ID Yeah PM So I think if its so then its cool ID So I dunno what you think Bob but it would be great for users I think and very good for marketing ME Definitely ME The softer the better ID Yeah PM Cool ME Yeah PM Honestly speaking I cannot imagine it so far but it will be terrible ID Yeah ID Um PM Mm ID And setting buttons hidden in ID Mm other remarks or something or ID Something we didnt talk about yes yet or ID I think we are almost there ID Uh maybe how can we if we have a soft thing like this and to open it we have to attach it somewhere I dunno how to do that technically or UI Mmhmm ID And how Yeah maybe PM Pof ME We could use Velcro ME Or uh ma maybe a magnetic thing UI Yes yeah its a good idea UI Magnetic ID Ma magnetic oh UI Mm UI Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border so its it sticks like refrigerator door completely ID Okay UI And when you try to open it it will be opened easily UI So you you can be sure that it will not be open while youre uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana ID Okay ID And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ID Mm ID Likes ID Soft plastic or Yeah yeah yeah ME Yeah I imagine some sort of vinyl thing ME In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel ME Maybe PM Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things PM So if if uh the solar cell wont be visible while the banana is closed then the material must be able to put the light inside you know PM So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that ME Mm UI Mm ME So youre saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana PM It is possible but well if it I dunno UI Mm PM I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if its better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it or or inside ID Hmm ME Yeah PM But then it must be some window there you know ME Okay UI Mm ID And something we forgot maybe uh about the speech recognition system are we going to use it or not UI Yes I think ME I think its important UI I think so ID It i Yeah it seems feasible and it would be something very great ME I think One of our p priorities is tech technology UI Mm ME And Mmhmm ID So we have the de design the a good shape new and so on and we have also the technology thing w will be UI Mmhmm ID And even the easy to use thing so it will be perfect UI Mm UI Mm ID So we add also the speech recognition device ME Yeah PM Yeah PM I agree ID So that great ID We have decided everything ID And think we are on a good way ID So um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ID Um so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design ID The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device ID And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation ME Okay ID So I hope you can do that in thirty minutes ID And uh yeah I uh I think you should work together s you uh Hamed and Peter to work uh in a in a first prototype and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together ID And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on ID So thank you all everybody and see you in thirty minutes PM Okay ME Okay ME Thank you PM Okay UI Thank you,"The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports. He found that current trends are such that a product must have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif, and must be spongy. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use. The user interface designer discussed the placement of commonly used buttons, the overall shape of a remote, and how to hide less commonly used buttons. The industrial designer discussed various components and energy sources the remote could include. The industrial designer focused on the use of a TFT screen and the use of solar cells to supplement the energy from two regular batteries. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding the option to use solar cells, the specifications of an LCD screen, how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into their design, and how to hide lesser used buttons."
PM Oops ID So hello everyone ID Were here to have a kickoff meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control ID Im the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay lets begin ID So Im first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool were going to design and try to make a project plan some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting ID So um we want to to do a new remote control ID It has to be original trendy and user friendly ID Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh its functional design its conceptual design and desail detailed design ID and for that were going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day ID Um so lets try the whiteboard ME Wow ID Um so any of you who want to go PM Yeah for favourite animals PM Its gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw PM And its gonna be youll try to guess ME Wow ID Wow ME Complex ME Huh ME A cat UI No PM No ME No ME Darn ME Uh ID A rabbit PM Yes thats a rabbit ME A what PM Thats my favourite one ID A rabbit ME A r a rabbit oh oh yeah where is the carrot UI Rabbit ME Okay mmhmm PM Thats it ID You want to go ME I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff PM Hmm ME My favourite animal is Guess PM Wow UI You wa Is the white okay ID A human ah ME A human yay ME Its a very complex animal and um yeah PM No ME Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous ID Mm I think youre supposed to yeah ID Hmm UI I guess you can PM Wow PM Thats cobra ME Ah a kind of uh snake ME Cobra ME Exactly UI Yeah uh not really UI Small cobra PM No it just small cobra yeah ME Uhhuh ID Is that a worm PM Its co c quite recognisable ID Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm ME What about you uh Christa UI Chris PM Christa Christa ME A fish UI Mm PM Hmm ID Smiling fish UI Smile fish ME A smiling fish ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Okay ME So w whiteboard is working UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Good ME Next ID Next ID Lets talk about money PM Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer ME Yeah well PM According to the drawings ME Not me UI Yeah youre Hmm PM Okay ME So ID So ME Twenty five Euro for a remote control ID Yeah mm thats the price we want to thats the aim for the price for the remote control ME Okay ID We aim to do this profit ME tis big number PM On the international market ID Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Yeah were to sell two million then PM Wow ME Mmhmm ID Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum ID Kay ID So any of you have experience in remote controls ME Uh yes we have plenty at home UI Mm yeah ME In fact my daughter likes l remote controls ID That So that could be a great um application PM Mm PM To eat ME To eat ME Yeah mainly and to break ID Remote controls children proof ME Mmhmm ID Mm mmhmm ME Yeah ME Ye ye yeah PM Children proof PM Hmm ME So she likes uh buttons which make click so it has to click UI Yeah pret Yeah ID Okay ID So they have to be waterproof maybe ME It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if shes not very tall shes uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away its uh So it has to be very robust ID Cause they eat she ate it ID Mmhmm UI Ah PM Okay unbreakable ME Unbreakable yeah PM Uhhuh UI Yeah we have some child lock or something yeah ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME And uh it has to be nice looking colourful maybe colourful because uh nobody has colourful remote control theyre always black yeah but this one could be I dunno purple or b Yeah yeah UI Yeah ID Colourful yeah mm PM Colourful PM Thats not practical UI Yeah ID No thats a good idea UI Yeah its always black or yeah ID Mm mmmm PM No PM But how gonna okay just uh but its uh monochrome its n its not like Otherwise you will never find it ID Yeah UI Yeah ID No because you think why not UI Yeah ME One colour UI Yeah ME Yeah yeah UI Yeah even we can change colours no UI Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah ME Oh like the phones yeah it could change colours yeah PM Cool ID Mmhmm UI At least for children like one colour and PM Ch Yeah but without any extremes like n not of this size not too large ME Yeah ME Good ID Good idea UI And it should be really small and ID Small also ID Dont you think No uh not too much buttons or mm UI Huh not so big like yeah UI Yeah not too much buttons and Uh ME Should it be y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now its the remote control for the television then its the remote control for the the sound system or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if its Or if we should have a targeted re remote control ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Yeah thats Okay ID So I think theres So you you think its better if small than bigger ME So colour robustness easy to use size yeah size matters yeah UI Yeah UI Colour size sh Yeah maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess ME Mm ID No not too small yeah UI Yeah yeah at least it should hold in your hand n properly like PM Okay ME Yeah ID Hmm PM Yeah like a palm sized UI Yeah ME Mm PM Just to hold it ID Okay ME But uh what would be different from this from the others ME I dunno if Yeah at least the colour would be different UI Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame UI Mm UI S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame ID Mm ME I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it theyre they never find a good button in the right place UI Yeah yeah ID Mmhmm ME For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So theres a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow I dunno UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Mm ID So some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no PM No no screens its too complex ID Okay UI Mm ME Too expensive for twelve Euro UI Too expensive yeah PM And n maybe not too expensive well its not my problem but well okay ID And too expensive ME Ah PM But no screens on remote controls ME Mmhmm ID Mm ME I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user ME So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right so I would have my own design of the remote control because its in fact just a a full touch screen remote control if you if you like PM Mmhmm UI Ye yeah UI Hmm UI I mean it its like its like two types no ME I dont know if it makes sense but Yeah for instance mm ID Mmmm UI people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this say if youre right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah PM Mmhmm mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Mm ID Mm mm mm ID So adaptable yeah something yeah PM Adaptable ME Maybe if if its possible yeah PM Alright good so how many actions do we need to implement in it UI Mm huh UI Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working PM On off ME Yeah UI We can adapt only one switch suppose here like we can make two switches and if Im lefthander I use this switch to follow the main operations PM I mean if its less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states yeah you know what I mean we can just make it uh controlled by a brain huh UI Two ME Three buttons you mean ID Three option ME Ah UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Um ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm yeah sure ID Maybe if its more if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm PM Mmhmm ID If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button three mm possibilities ye yeah PM Sh sure sure ME Yeah more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time UI Mm yeah UI Yeah PM But for standard actions you usually what do you do you change channels you adjust volume and nothing else ME Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five UI Mm UI Yeah ID Mm ME And thats already more complex to go to channel twenty five PM Mmhmm PM You do this UI Yeah ME Uh no PM I usually just change channels ME Because Im only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before so theres whichever it was UI Yeah UI But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah you can only have one bit ID Yeah ID I change channel like this m uh I want to go to twenty five and then to ten uhhuh mm yeah UI Dash ID Also we can be here yeah that would be cool PM Uhhuh UI Yeah you can yeah PM Go back button is good UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Uh uh we had that in in other countries PM I once had it UI Yeah yeah the previous button is ID Mm yeah ME Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous PM Mmhmm UI Uh okay PM History UI Oh uh ME Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions that becomes more complex but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls UI Uh UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah ID Mmmm ME Yeah maybe its a Okay ID Okay ID So I think we have full of idea ID Um were going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we dont want ID And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do ID Um ID So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes ME So what does ME means ME ME the user requirements ME Or thats uh thats for us PM Market Expert ID Mm ME Uh thats me ME Oh of course yeah the user requirement specifications uhhuh yeah ID Mmhmm ME Okay ID Mm okay ME Ill think of that ID So ME So ID I think thats all ME Meetings over ME Great ID Yeah PM Okay UI Thank you ME Thank you PM Thank you everybody ID See you in thirty minutes,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a ""go back"" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team."
ID So I hope youre ready for this uh functional design meeting ME So Of course ID Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation ID Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new projects requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I dont remember which is not very good ID Ah of course how to to design this uh this yeah ME Nice stuff Who starts ID So um lets go for the three presentations so first um Marketing Expert ME Oh ME Ha ME okay ID So wait a minute ME So I dunno if I can do that like this ID Mm ME Yeah ME So its being modified ME Do you want yeah open ME Read only ME I hope I saved it ME So um yeah this is my name PM Sammy Benjo PM I know this name uh ID Sounds uh Mm uh PM We met before ME So as you know you I think you already know me Sammy Benjo ME I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly ME So next please ME Uhoh UI Yeah it is put F five ID Hmm ME Hmm UI The full page presentation yep ME Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation so PM F F five ID Okay UI Yeah UI Yep ID F five UI Yeah ME Uhhuh hmm okay ID Mmhmm ID Mm ME So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control lets ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls what they like what they dont like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful ME Dont forget about that ME So weve weve conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and Id like to show you some of the results we found on this survey ME And next please ME Yeah so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user dont like in remote controls ME First of all they find it very ugly ME Current remote controls as you know theyre the same as this one uh theyre not nice colour not nice shape I mean theyre all the same and theyre not l good looking ME Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um ME And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls ME For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another ME And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using ME Um next please ME Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they dont even find it its its often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is UI Yeah ME Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please where are you PM Agree UI Yeah ME Like uh something to to like t I think phones UI Yeah ME Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality ME Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you cant phone your your remote control UI You can you are ID Why not ME But why not ME Yeah ME And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use in fact they dont even know how to use them so most of the the people say they they dont know how to they to use properly their r remote controls UI Hmm ME And uh they are bad for RSI but uh I dont remember what is RSI ME So I think they are bad ID Okay uh tha thats look great PM RSI mmhmm ME Mmhmm ME Mm nobody has any idea about that ME Well Ill check uh with my Oh okay I think its a technical thing which our Okay UI Yeah its electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect PM No I dont think so UI Yeah because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology and those waves have high Uh ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM Okay ME So it seems that its a lot of people for a concept that we dont know but we have to take this into account PM But twenty six percent do you know Twenty five ID Or something we dont know UI Uh PM Every fourth you know ID Mmhmm UI Yeah its People really Yeah PM Every four some of us knows ID Okay ME So anyway thats for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um what else do I have PM One of us Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Next slide ME Ah yeah ME So weve listed a couple of uh s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session but it is very relevant PM Functions ME People want to have a power button ME Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant ME Ah now I remember what is RSI its repetitivity stress injury ME We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah channel selection is um very important very often used UI Uh ME Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course ME And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings ME Audio settings screen settings even teletext and channel settings ME All of them ME theyre not often used and they are s more or less relevant ME It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant even if I personally never use it but seems that its average relevant at least so ID I have been told that we uh dont consider teletext that its out of date now because of internet ME I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think ID Mmhmm ME But but if you compare with these ones uh I think they scored a one or two ME Not very relevant so if if there are good reason not to put teletext its okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant UI Hmm ID Mmhmm Mmmm PM Mmhmm ME Thats for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people dont have that may be useful ME For instance I think net next slide ME One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control so you wouldnt have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want ME So weve conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age ME Young people probably because its a buzz word find it very relevant ME And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down UI Yeah ME So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ME I think if we are targeting young people then uh its probably something we have to consider UI Cause Thank you ME If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really dont know why they this should be so now this is of course depends on that ID Okay ME And um I dont have any conclusion I didnt have time the meeting was very tight so thats basically my findings ME And uh if you have any question ID Mm I think its good okay ID You done a good review PM I got one question uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not ME I can go back ME Yeah one question yeah ME I am ME I think we should aim at the young people ME But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device UI Mm ME In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people less than more than Then teletext is useless for them I think yeah PM Okay then teletext is used less UI Mm ID Mmhmm PM Okay ME Because they they have other means of finding their information PM Mmhmm ID Mmhmm mm mm PM Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Okay ME But yeah ID Thats good point UI Mm yep PM Mm PM Okay ME Nope ME Kay ID Okay UI Thank you ID So um now I think its the turn of the the Im not sure um Of the technical function so uh what effect Okay ME So I think its you huh UI Uh its techni function of Yeah ME No PM Thats me ME No user requiremen Makes sense ID Wait a second UI I have to do working design so uh ID Argh ID So youre Okay PM Thats but this but number three yes PM Mmhmm PM So my name is Mark Dwight and um I am responsible for User Interface Design PM However uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design PM Uh as Im a more an artist thats gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this PM So next slide please ID Lets go PM And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor UI Mm PM We should never complicate things too much PM We should only make a remote control nothing more PM Nothing more than this just a remote control PM Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use PM So make a click please PM So here is this remote control PM Its quite a standard one but its not from a TV its from a much easier device like air conditioning or something PM But you know we can use it for a TV easily PM Only buttons we need is on off volume channels and maybe some options or something else and please make a click compared to this one which one would you prefer UI Its Yeah yeah PM I guess this ME I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button PM Sure sure UI Yeah UI Maybe it can be yeah middle of like between those two li S you should yeah PM Yeah and our method is going to be provide simple simple desires into simple actions ID Oh sorry ME Nice ME Nice sentence PM Findings ID Okay ID Oh sorry PM Our question of the style we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it PM Concept PM Be simple PM Be simple and youll lean on this market PM Market is a of remote controls you know it better its very well its its not an easy field to to play you know ME Mm PM So be simple PM For personal preferences I think that to make a babyproof remote control it got to be a titanium PM Its a really good style it going to be look like like this PM It is unbreakable and it is very universal PM W well have a screen with a back light which can change colours and we can put all the options into this screen ME Mmhmm PM Well need only few buttons PM All the other things can be controlled through the screen PM And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something you always try to find a good button and click it but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch PM So Press I would propose this concept for design just few buttons a screen with a back light which can change colours titanium I think and uh what else UI Mm PM I got just very few and good ideas PM We need power and volume PM And let us include two nice features into this device first power on and off can be made fully automatic PM When you go to the sofa take your control and point it to the TV the TV turns on ID Its off ME Hmm ID Its on ME And when does it turn off PM When you dont touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time like uh you Its a question to our technical design our two engineers ME Oh so you have a sensing sensor machine that uh knows Tech Mmhmm PM And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control PM Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you PM Like you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something and then the volume changes ID Or you want to go to the kitchen PM Its easy to do you just control the According to the distance ME According to your distance to and the angle maybe if you have a stereo system UI Distance PM Yeah yeah yeah ME Uh Im not sure about the screen wha what is the use usefulness of the screen PM So I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left right up down and enter ME Uh is it a touch screen by the way ME So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow UI Yeah PM So its main purpose in fact is a back light which change colours which makes it easier to find and each can it can respond for your voice like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily yeah UI Mmhmm ME Okay ME Okay ID Mm PM So basically thats it ID Um I see that you target uh several s application not only TV but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control PM Can be easily done cause you got simple designs y we should put it to simple actions ID Yeah ID Hmm PM Let it be universal so you want to use it for your hifi system PM You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume ID Mmhmm PM Just few actions a few actions for everything UI Mm ID Hmm ID S Mm PM All the rest we sh well put it into this menu on the screen ID Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on TV for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah UI Mm PM Okay okay UI Yeah and it mm PM Okay but its quite universal you know UI Mm PM We can just extend it to any device UI Mm ME So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five how would I do can I do that with this PM Uh twenty five ME Yeah mm lets say I am uh on channel eight now ME You know these days we have hundreds of channels thats not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels PM Mmhmm PM In fact I would propose another solution ME Or is it PM Basically you use just four or five channels right ME Most people yeah PM Yeah PM So uh set up your TV set like channels that you use theyre one two three and five and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel ME In fact in in one uh remote control that Ive seen instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three twenty eight forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button ID Yeah its its the same solution I think ME I uh B yeah UI Yeah ID Hmm UI But even we can have some uh LCD display like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because Yeah ME Go to channel twenty five ME One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap ME So even if they are only watching four or five channels I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels just because this is one kind of thing they do zapping PM Mmhmm UI But still Yeah ID Yeah uh on zap its only next next next next next yeah UI Yeah ME And its only next UI Yeah ME Yeah so but you have to Okay PM Mm ID Mmhmm PM We got these buttons here PM Next next UI Yeah PM Or say this can be back UI Yeah UI But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then Yeah ME So it would be Okay ID Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah ME Mmhmm ME Alright UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah but since we are focusing only on TV remote controls so we can have more functions for TV uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices ME Listening more ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Okay PM Could we carry out some research if we w really need this like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ME Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Okay ME Ill check in my department if theres someone specialist in that PM Okay ME Although I dont know ID Okay PM Alright PM Thanks for your attention ID Uh youre finish ID Okay ID So now the technical aspects of this new device ID Mm UI Two UI Yeah if Sorry ID You prefer it UI Yeah UI Uh as you know I am mister Ramaro UI I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators UI So now Ill briefly describe the working design of our remote control UI Well as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device like TV or VCR or DVD player etcetera UI So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like TV UI So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions what we want on this portable device UI And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that UI And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device UI Its generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information UI Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want UI So basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want and then we have some chip its mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format UI And then well have the infrared LED source which sends the information to the main device UI Then well have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations and we ought to do different codes for different TVs so some TVs will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh UI Yeah yeah because the people dont use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands which are really good ID Mm ID Okay UI So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption thats passing information to the TV device UI So we need to have particular encryption codes ID Okay UI Then components so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device UI Uh since I dont have much time so Ill input the connections to all this components UI And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them ID Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard or mm UI Yeah UI Yeah Im sure because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy so we can have another like uh s simple speech recogniser on our DSB chip ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID Mm UI Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery so this battery once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah so that we just use simple recog no but but Yeah ID On Uh train it okay ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm PM Too complex ME But uh very very good to sell UI No even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things yeah ME Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them and ha ha you cannot use my remote control because its targeted to me PM Okay PM Okay UI Yeah ID Mm UI Yeah ME Whatever ID And what about the price of this component UI So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that because we want to have uh millions and in bulk so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power switch on or some like then well have something like this um well have volume and then we will have s particular channel so users can listen ID It mm okay ME Hmm ME Cheap ME Millions ID Mm ID Okay ME Cheap ID Mmhmm ME The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume up down ID Mmhmm UI Ye No yeah a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase so we try to only recognise those words and and because we cant really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah ME Okay ID With a keywords and yeah ME Okay ME Couple of words ID Mmhmm mm ID Mmhmm ME Okay ID Okay PM Um UI And then we can have channel they can say okay I want eight because we dont know like users have different programmes I mean they dont really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number we dont want like BBC or CNN or something else because it will be complicated so well have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem its it it will be take care of our main mm ME Of course uh it has to be Okay ID Okay PM Okay PM No you know its a conceptual question cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it volume up volume up and and hes coming you know hes really annoyed with this down up down ME But then I think you you First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons ID No in no not only speech yeah ME Its on top of using the button PM Okay for this budget like twelve Euros ID I its an option ME Well I dunno UI Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on on and off this processor and This really suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power volume and this part and this DSPs PM Mmhmm UI Again this to have some interaction like suppose people use DSP then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form like volume and like this key UI So it may not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on TV remote control so and we have only few things here Yeah PM Okay ME TV ID Okay PM Mmhmm mmhmm ID Sho to to train okay PM Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition PM Like if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll em up or roll em down UI Um uh uh this point we didnt consider because its its very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and Yeah even automatic on off is also a bit problematic because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they dont touch the remote and mm y you dont know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and Yay yeah ID Mm ME Very expensive no ID And well what about the idea of automatic on off on the button yeah PM Mm why PM Thats just We got a really good Market Expert ME And volume control ME So but uh Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ME So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control ME We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings UI Yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay suppose theyre watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I They can make Yeah we can have Yeah ME Hmm ID Wouldnt that make uh arguments ME Yeah of course ID I want uh And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with Mmhmm ME Thats no problem we will sell more ME Yeah exactly PM Lets send more lets sell more PM Okay ID Okay ID You have mm something else to say UI Uh not very much like yeah ID Uh ID No ME Okay ME Thanks ID Okay thanks UI Thank you UI Yep UI Thank you ID So mm mm I think okay were just on time UI Can you just yeah ID Um mm mm ID So were now going to l have the lunch break ME Mm great ID Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the UID Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching UI Yeah yeah UI Mark will Uh its in current price yeah ID So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach ID Well I think thats all ID And we have um maybe we have to we say only for TV not teletext ID Uh I think automatic on off control uh its not possible ME Difficult ID Yeah maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um UI Yeah UI But speech recogniser can be possible ID Yeah implemented ID O okay we can think about that ME Mmhmm ID And um do you see something else ME No PM Uh should it be equipped with the uh with uh speakers ME Speakers in the remote cont Oh yeah PM Like you want to find it you shout control and it answers is Im here ID Uh yeah thats Or maybe you want to phone him PM Or Just beeps ME It just beeps ME That would be enough ME Something very cheap ME But thats ex thats expensive UI Yeah yeah yeah ID Since now all yeah ME Uh UI Yeah especially the power it really consumes because it should be all the time on and Yeah ID Think Uhhuh ME Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that ID And uh And its answered UI Yeah PM I cant whistle PM No no I cant ME You cant whistle ME Uhhuh ME Or a clap PM Mm ID Clap clap clap its a good I I think its universal ME You can clap ME Can you UI Yeah ME Clap is good UI Yeah ME Tak Just a suggestion ID What about people without hand PM Okay ID Yeah ME With only one hand UI Yeah I think its good ME These are not our target people ID Mm uh okay UI But its a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM Just dont interfere with other devices like cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping ME Mmhmm ME Oh thats e that already exists okay okay UI Oh PM Yeah I got it at my home like ID Mmhmm ME Oh yeah you do have PM Oops ME Wow UI Ah its Yeah ME Youre trendy ID Mmhmm so lets to think s so that yeah ME Think about it ME Yeah okay ID I think that could be in the component uh concept uh ID It yes ME Okay ID Okay ME Good were done ID So yeah lets go to lunch UI Yeah ME Right thanks UI Thank you thank you very much,"The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly, difficult to use, have a number of unused buttons, frustrate users when misplaced, and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power, channel selection, volume control, and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs, discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen, and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing, the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced."
ID Okay so now we are on the conceptual design meeting ME Mmhmm ID Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting PM How was lunch ID Mm great ME Thanks Dont be sarcastic ME Mark ID So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design first Rama then Mark and then Sammy ME Uh Rama UI Ramaro ID Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes PM Mm ID So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case ID And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements ID And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what hes hes been doing ID Its So lets go ID First with Rama ID Participant two UI Yeah participant two UI Component ID Mmhmm UI Yep UI So were to mainly design f mainly need to know which components well use for energy and the material and interface UI For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities UI First one we can use simple battery or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic rubber which is good for this RSA and then uh titanium which can be which have very good look an and then interface were to use push buttons or liquid crystal d LCD display ME Ah UI And we can use some moving kind of thing UI So as we discussed before we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control UI So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors UI And we also want to look at our remote control so UI Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range like were to in our twelve Euros or around that UI So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house ID Mmhmm okay UI So uh we discussed an Excuse me UI So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery ME Mmhmm UI And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we cant use doublecurved shapes ME What is a doublecurved shape UI Like you can have two curves ME Uhhuh PM Why UI Uh its I think in manufacturing I guess its problematic UI So we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and its really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to LCD which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and its more expensive since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost PM Mmhmm ME The cost ID Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber if it is something that it seems to be light UI Uh Uh And also like in if you put a its be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and Yeah ID Okay ID You m titanium its more uh Yes so mm Uhhuh PM W we can use something like you know the whole bodys titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know Yeah ME Mm like this UI Yeah UI Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Okay UI But full assembly Well use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also its bit difficult to do all the shapes uh ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay UI And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of LCDs and so we want to mo I mean were we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for S S Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology so Uh l So uh its like a Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how well come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter Ok Yeah that can we we can consider because like it wont take much money I guess because Okay yep ID Uh yeah so Okay s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated ME Speech LCD PM Mmhmm ID Okay PM Okay and still we have mm can we still include the L LSD display PM LCD yeah LCD ME Seems not its either LCD or pushbutton PM No its not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus ME Ah PM Okay so lets try it lets t Yeah yeah its its not gonna be a touch pad uh just a display for giving you information ME The LCD would The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean ME Just uh for output yeah ME Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Okay ID Mm UI You have any further questions or ME I guess no um ME So the batteries uh are going to be very light UI Yeah UI Yeah were to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price ME Okay PM Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ME So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically instead of clapping why not just be ask UI Yeah thats then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent ME Mmhmm UI If were going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so Yeah if if everybody in the house n to locate then were to go for some speaker independent technology or something ID Okay for the location ID Hmm ME Okay ID Okay ID So lets now go to the you dont have more question ME No its okay PM No more questions ID Um mm thank you mm UI Yep UI Thank you ME Puts less of constraint on what we can do but its always like that PM Mm yeah yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah ME We have dreams and the in the end we find out that its not feasible ID Yeah but mm UI Oh ME Anyway UI We have uh some limitations ME Yeah PM But still uh LSDs already quite nice LC Im an artist sorry ME LCD ME LSD is something else and its quite nice as well ID Okay ME So go on uh artist PM So uh thats not I hope thats not too much ID Um yeah ID Now lets talk about uh interface PM Okay PM Uh participant number three ID Three UI Three PM Uh mm mm uh have a look at this no its yeah ID Which one ME Hmm ID Okay PM Uh so the concept of the interface PM Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for possible instruction or users manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your TV and remote controls PM So lets start with this PM We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the LCD is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button I dont know really where it is maybe one of this buttons and um power on and off mm I I dont remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ID Mm PM Or no PM I can see nothing PM So thats our concept PM Its called the millennium remote control ME Lets change millenniums PM Yeah UI So maybe you can use in the end and Uh Mm ME doesnt make sense ME This is very ugly PM Really PM I thought you like it ME Oh no too much concept PM Ah okay just press the button please uh ME Ah ID No PM Yeah we will not use this PM We will not use this PM But instead of this I will devise Thats our concept ME Ah back today PM And its got just few buttons quite low looking and all this stuff we already we already discussed ID Mmhmm ID Kay PM And uh what will people say PM Theyll say its perfect PM Or what will say PM Uh they will say its splendid PM And uh e everyone will say Ill buy it ID Mmhmm PM And everyones gonna be satisfied ME Do you think it can come in several colours ME Or did the Um but not the case PM I would make a backlight of the LCD screen with different colours PM Not the case ME Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff like Yeah well they like uh something which is uh Mm yeah okay so that would be the option PM Yeah ID Because apparently from your survey people like colours no UI Yeah PM Okay so lets remember theres a Nokia phone which changeable panels PM Do you like it ME I dont know I dont have a Nokia phone but I dont use that but again uh I might Yeah bu but Mmhmm UI But its uh But it would be expensive no PM Thats why you dont have it PM Thats why cause its nasty UI If you use colour LCD PM No UI Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler UI Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly PM Um I am here UI So users have different I mean they have their own interests colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro ID Okay ID So PM Mmhmm ID Uhhuh okay so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on LCD yeah PM Kay UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah yes UI If they want like uh so that we can yeah ME Kind of upgradable uh remote control UI Yeah ME Wow wow ID Okay UI Just theyll get few more things and few more colours PM Okay what uh theres one more decisi uh one more solution in fact um cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around like what colour is around and depending on the temperature yeah UI Lights yeah ME Mm ID And thermodynamic also UI Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Like a chameleon ID Mmhmm UI Yeah yeah PM We can make it in fact ID Yeah but thats maybe mo too much expensive yeah UI Mm PM If if if the okay ME Mmhmm ID But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version but Mmhmm PM Mmhmm mmhmm so Uhhuh UI Yeah ME Because uh I think there are two kinds of people ME Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh Im going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it its like a signature ME My remote control is pink ME Nobody else than me has a pink remote control ME And that makes me special ID Okay and you think that we dont have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is Okay so so i its not uh a s base service its a Mm ME I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that ME Those who wanted to have it pink UI Uh Mm ME No mm no PM So be an option yeah ME It might be optional yeah ID Okay UI But those people will be really few no UI So like we can those Ah ME The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends ME Although similar but have something just slightly better ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Pink Mm ID So m so maybe thats if that its a selling point maybe it has to be the base UI Mm PM Yeah yeah yeah ME Yeah PM But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time PM And it makes you different you know ME Yeah yeah ID And youll be different ME You always have your remote ID Uh in the train uh hello uh no ME Oh you dont PM Anyone has their remote controls here ME Yeah ME You dont have your remo Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod PM No ID Want to change my neighbour ME Its a kind of remote control ME Uh its white and its so white that you see it from any anywhere PM Mmhmm ME It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because its a colour that we dont usually see in a remote control ID Mm PM Okay ME White PM Uhhuh uhhuh ID Mmhmm PM Could we integrate something into our remote control something like light ME Seems important UI Hmm PM That they can use it in darkness like ME Mm glow in the dark so Okay PM Hand light yeah UI Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah PM Mmhmm ID Iradium PM Okay UI Yeah that Oh ID Ah sorry PM Okay ID Mm ID Okay PM Okay PM S well lets go on maybe with the presentation ID So mm Mmhmm ME Yeah ME Uhhuh yeah sure PM And um the remote controls going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much PM And uh I dunno thats a question to you and to mm to Mmhmm ME Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so thats the smartness of the thing ME Currently we dont have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition PM Okay okay ME I dunno ID Mm thats a nice world PM So just just just just think about it um ME Dont touch the remote PM Thank you ID Okay ME But yeah ME Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ME So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesnt want PM Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart ME Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or Mm PM Voice recognition is quite tough PM I say dont use it and the control just looks UI Yeah PM Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it ME Um Mm UI Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah ME Okay ME So it could be smart in that way UI Yeah yeah ID Mm ID Okay ME But for instance th I Im thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have ME S since it it knows who is using it it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that youre more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them I dunno somehow I dunno that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again UI Yeah PM Yeah sure ID Mm UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Uh its Hmm ME The remote that knows you PM Mmhmm ID Okay PM Okay thanks ID So its yeah Marketing Expert ME My turn ME Okay its alright ID Participant two UI Four ID Four sorry ME Four I think ME Trend yeah ME No uh yes ME Okay so Im going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control ME So next slide please ME So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so its not so uh simple you might think that its easy but uh its not so simple ME Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them always like a phone ME We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired ME Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact theyre not only watching the trends theyre inventing it theyre creating the trend ME I hope Im going to try to help you on that ME This is more risky because youre not following the trend you try to invent it which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you dont and youre out of business ME So anyway uh next slide please ME Uh to be to be quick theres a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to ME The first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy it has to have a fancy look and feel ME And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing ME It has to be fancy ME Strangely enough its more important to be fancy than to be wi and now thats the second thing it has to be it has to be technologically i innovative it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control ME So as you see uh it first have to be very nice s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends huh mine has this and not yours ME And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that its not so important that its useful as a remote control ME Next slide please ID Mm ME Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing ME If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think its important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan well it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so ME And I think of course uh i it applies to everything ME Thats the thing with trends ME It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea ME Fruit and vegetable ME Think fruit and vegetable ME And uh if we co we compare to last year now it has to be spongy yeah UI Mm PM What is spongy ME Well this so so I think uh uh i When we were talking about rubber I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because its what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess UI Yeah kind of um maybe Yeah it Yeah ID Mmhmm ID S So maybe titanium its not a good idea UI Yeah ME Seems not seems not UI We need to think about mm mm ID Mmhmm ME Yeah ME So Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow ID Um sorry Mark ID It seems to be Mmmm UI Fruit UI Even shape UI More yeah UI Yeah ME I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like ID Mmhmm UI Mm ME So thats what people seem to yeah i I know its quite far from what you thought but thats thats fashion and Okay thats all I have to say ID Hmm ID Youre oldfashioned ID Sorry PM Okay ID Okay ID Mm you have questions UI So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people UI Or its This you you so did you Where ME These Im sorry ME Yeah yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course as you know our company is quite big and uh so Im just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well UI Oh UI Oh okay mmhmm UI Its not from mm UI Mmhmm UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Its more general trend its not particular to the remote control ME No its not its not this this is very general yeah ME But it seems that trends travel across things UI Mm UI Yeah ME The what we Sure UI Yeah but some materials n theyre to be uh theyre to be something like solid like they cant be really spongy or yeah yeah ME Yeah ME We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside so of course UI yeah yeah sponge yeah yeah at least thats Yeah yeah that yeah yeah ME This is your problem ME This is not mine UI Yeah UI Yeah looking yeah fruit UI These things can be easily incorporated UI We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah ME Yeah I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material ME If if its something like rubber made or I think it its also going to be good UI Yeah ID Mm UI Mm ID Mmhmm ME Okay UI Yeah ID Okay ID No more question ID Okay ME Yep ME Thanks ID So Mmhmm ID Okay so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again ID Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design um Mark the user interface design and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation UI Look and feel de Hmm ME Mmhmm ID Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay UI Hmm UI Mm sounds interesting ID Mmhmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction ME Okay PM Okay ME Thanks UI So can we highlight the specific features of our yeah so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables thats we want to follow general trend ID Yeah youre right you have to So you say s S do we agree on that ME Spongy UI Yeah ID Yeah ID We have to UI So do you think Hmm PM So we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ME No we dont have to but seems its the trend ID No ME Again as I said we can also try to make it to create the trend UI Yeah ME So theres no Well thats you t can try to convince us UI Yeah PM Well we can make it smell like fruit ME Okay ID Okay thats a good idea UI Thats So what about location and these things people are really interesting on those features ME thats a good idea I Uh I think i yeah i its again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think its a good sell for us because we have it and others dont ID So titanium smell like fruit PM Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Or they really like They more want these fancy features like Feature Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Okay ME Its fancy ME Whether its useful or not doesnt seem to be very important UI Yeah ID I I agree with uh this uh Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness UI Yeah ID Do we take titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy uh fruitylike Mm UI Yeah UI Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah ME Maybe you could explore the two option ID Yeah yeah PM Mmhmm mmhmm PM Could we make a titanium shape UI Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah its its yeah thats a were to look for and and s were to see the whether rubber is expensive and d Hmm PM I mean fruitshaped ID Dont you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah PM But Doub doublecurved ME Mm ME Seems to be ID Mmhmm ID Okay PM Okay okay PM In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body PM Well okay w well see ID Mmmm ID Okay so you explore now that youre going to work together these these two PM Yeah Well see UI Mm ID Or or spongy an yeah UI Yeah UI Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium ID Mm UI we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or Uh ME If you have time PM Well see ID Mm ID Yeah I dont think w I think we have to choose ID If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both PM Well see PM I I really dont like this modelling clay cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um well look UI Yeah ME For creation UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Ah you can pretend that its uh titanium UI Even design ME You can paint it afterward PM Okay okay ME No problem ME We have a very large department of paint ID Yeah do dont worry you you you speak with mm mm ME You will do it PM Alright alright ID Okay ID So explore a shape UI So still we want to keep LCD UI Or Okay ID Mm I think its what we say that we have an uh an LCD with uh information ME Yeah ID Not uh Mmhmm ME The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are UI Yeah then we can yeah yeah that user friendly or Mm ME Yeah ID Mm ME Thats the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing UI Yeah ID Mm UI Yeah ID Okay UI and we just stick with two batteries so its not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah because Yeah ME Yeah ME Classical we stay classical in that we dont reinvent uh the wheel ID Yeah yeah yeah ID Mm ME Anyway its very in general I think people uh change TV more often than batteries of their remote control ME So ID Yeah ME Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So its very Okay ID Mmhmm PM Mmhmm ID Okay ID So are we mm UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Were done UI Yeah were done ID Okay ID So see you in thirty minutes UI Yep,"The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, case materials and shapes, chips, and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control. The user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the ""millennium remote control"". The user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a ""smart"" remote which is in tune with the user's preferences. The marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, and be spongy. The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design."
ID Mm ME So Hi Christa ID So uh now its the Hi Sammy ID Its the detail design meeting so were going last meeting ID So um first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype ID Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype ID Then w we And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team ME Yes PM Yes PM And chocolate ID And thats all ME Mm ID Okay ID So first lets uh see the prototype UI Yeah UI Uh here we have our prototype model ID Okay PM Mmhmm ID And you have some slides then UI Yeah UI Yeah we have also some slides PM Yes and place some slides ID Yeah ID Mm ID Okay ID Uh so in which uh Mm okay UI In Yeah PM Uh participant three PM Prototype ID Mm UI Five PM Uh so this is our remote control UI Him PM Its a r working prototype PM You can use it now by switching all these buttons PM So first I present as we came to this perfect model and then well give some technical specifications ME Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Thats well so thats that PM Please next slide PM We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA and uh made some real good Yeah ID MASA PM If you can see this and the stars are showing that PM And um s society will accept that ME Mmhmm PM For sure PM And making some analysis of different fruits we choose the ultimate form ultimate colours and uh ultimate smell of it PM S please next slide PM But we still didnt want to go far from our titanium idea cause its the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select PM And its practical PM And its still say its for our needs so please press something PM And as I said its perfect ID Okay PM Please press it UI Experience UI Explanat See this PM Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device ME Such a nice thing PM So you can touch it with your hands ME Can I ME Hoho PM Sure UI You can Spongy PM Yes ID What do you say PM N You must say it ME It says I will uh Ill buy it PM Yeah ID One day ME If I if I need so ID He Hmm ME Hopefully my daughter will like it PM Okay PM Y and we got the answer PM Uh it is yes of course ME Yes of course ME Of c course PM please next slide PM Um this is a prototype PM You can have a look at it and Thats all I wanted to say ME Ah PM Now its technical specification by our colleague UI Hmm UI So Yeah ME Oh there is a button missing ME Okay UI This this is really flexible UI You can add your buttons ME Its in option UI Yeah UI So function mm So as we discussed we have to switch on switch off whenever we want ID Mmhmm UI And so we have buttons and using LCD or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the LCD and then do on and off UI Then you ha youll have volume control UI So you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume UI And we have some LCD controls UI Like m switching the LCD display if you want to use LCD or you dont want you can just use normal button ID Mmhmm UI And we have speech recognition UI Here you have microphone and then it date records your voice and then it try to recognise ME Hmm UI And it can also do the action UI And location finder UI And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser ME Mmhmm UI You can just say where is my remote control UI Or uh you can just give some nickname to your remote control like Bobby ME Hey babe ID Bobby UI And then it will say hi ME Bob ME Hey Bob UI Yeah hi and then you can use it ME Okay thats good ID Mmhmm ID Hmm ID Kay UI So um our team is now fruits UI Mainly strawberry UI So you can have And then you can see the look LCD and all the switches ME Oh these are strawberries ID Are colourful ID Yeah UI Material we want to stick to titanium UI We will send we want to Yeah or s So we want to have simple and perfect shapes like I shown in these phones ME Fruit smelling spongy titanium ME I didnt know it exist but thats great UI You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs UI And you can choose colours on your day for each day or even many colours ME Ha ID Hoho ME You mean we can change the colour uh of th Yeah ID Thats for the LCD or for the titanium UI For the LCD ME Yeah okay for the LCD UI With titanium its it is silver ME Tit titanium is Uh okay PM We are still working on titanium ID Mmmm UI Yeah PM So r well start with LCD UI Mm yeah PM You can ask Bob PM Its Tuesday UI Yeah ME Yeah Bob please ID Hey you know youre theme today ME Tuesday colour UI Yeah UI Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood or s And you can have many colours on weekends ME Okay ID Hmm ME Mmhmm ME Black for Sunday UI Or Huh ID And w wait wh what are the strawberries for ME On the LCD ID Wh wh Mmhmm ME Oh UI Ah these are like sensors ME Of course ME What do you think PM Thats location sensors ME Strawberry sensors ME Very useful ID Okay ID Strawberries UI So after this meeting well propose a party for our success for So if you are vegetarian or you have any options please let us know ID Ah ME Lounge meeting PM Yeah and we can just some strawberry first UI Yeah PM Um Oops ME Alright ME Good ID Okay UI S So any specific questions for Yeah ID Mmhmm ME So huh ME Interesting ME In interesting ME Mm mm ID Uh well see in the financial part if uh all gets into W Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ME It makes sense PM Lets make a party first maybe UI Yeah UI Then we can discuss We can Yeah then we can have how much for how money is left ME So uh this is What a design ID Mmhmm ID Okay ID Uh so Lets uh yeah lets see if uh th its meet the evaluation criterium ME Its my turn ME Mmhmm ME Lets see if this Yeah if you meet the evaluation criterion UI Yeah ID Oops UI Fudge ME Yeah ME So evaluation please ME So ME You made a very nice prototype and um I think we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it if it fulfils our what we want to do and things like that ME So mm Uh next slide please ME As you know before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control its very important to first verify if it makes sense if we have a chance to sell it UI Yeah ME Uh so we need to evaluate it um try to do it in a constative way and as much as we can ME To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven ME One meaning that ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion whatever it is ME And seven meaning no it doesnt fulfil at all ME And were all l going to list all the criterion ME Im going to go to that next slide and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven ID Okay ME And then we are just going to have an average which will give us the value of our uh remote control ME So maybe we can have a look at the criteria UI Fancy ME So these are the criterion uh Im I thought were important ME Of course this can be discussed but lets lets see so lets vote ME So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle ID Mmhmm ME So what do you think is it fancy UI Huh UI Yeah whats is really Uh its really Yeah ID Uh I think that fancy we can say it is fancy ME It is very very fancy ME Or have you ever seen something like that ID Oh ID I am not the d the only one choosing yeah ME Yeah of course ME What do you think ID Uh what do you think PM Feel the weight ME Is it The weight is later UI Oh PM Really ID Uhhuh ME Now were Were on the fanciness now PM Okay ME I think its quite fancy UI Yeah yeah ME Its uh Yeah so No its its one UI We can give at least five or six seven ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Its in the other ID Yeah ME Yeah o one means its yes a very fancy and seven mean no at all UI Oh Oh UI So Oh okay ID Mm UI Yeah okay UI Oh okay UI So M maybe two ME So its one or two ME What do you think ID Two ID Lets say two yeah ME Two ME Okay PM Two PM Two ME So here two ME Up ME Then we have uh technology UI Technology UI Yeah UI Um And we have LCD ME So what about technology ME We have uh we have speech recognition we have location based we have LCD UI So you change colours ID Change colour of t Yeah I think its a Yeah ME Change colour I mean thats very Quite d I think its a one for that at least UI Useful PM Yeah yeah yeah UI Yeah yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Uh No UI Its silly ME At least a one yeah ID Mmmm ME Robustness uhhuh UI Uh still we need to cha Yeah it Maybe strawberry ME So lets suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away ID Um The strawberries Oh ME Do you think it makes sense that its going to live again ME Uh maybe not the prototype ME Lets try ME Oh my god ME Okay we just lost one strawberry ME So Not at all UI Oh PM No PM How can I say this UI Yeah we can easily plug it PM Its still its still working and your daughter got a bonus ME It is Yeah PM A strawberry ME Yeah ME So its not so bad ID Mmmm ME I um uh I would say three UI Yeah yeah ID Yeah ID But its too UI Yeah ME Yeah that does make sense yeah ID Its um robust yeah UI Useful ME Useful ME Well so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control UI Yeah Yeah ME So I dont know ME These buttons are uh It not clear ID Oh yeah lets me try ME But you have at least uh next produce ID Yeah ID What is uh next please UI Yeah channel UI I this is volume control and channel changes ME Uh it depends on the Okay UI These are the main You Yeah ID And you can uh do di two sites ID Yeah UI Yeah and you can do on LCD using these going to scrolling all the option ID Okay also ME So but for instance because the LCD is not uh touch control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five directly UI So if you dont want Yeah um yeah ID You can by using the You c push here the the yeah UI Yeah PM You can ME Directly PM You go you So the basic mode Yeah PM So thats simple PM The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial ME Yeah PM With two buttons you do this like uh volume up volume down ME Oh its a jog dial okay ME Uhhuh UI And channel PM Or if you go to the site its channel up channel down ME Okay PM And if you want to make to s twentyfive you push on this ME Yeah UI You can select PM You select twenty you select five ME Okay PM Thats it UI Yeah mm ME Its much longer than that that being two two five no PM No ME Dont you think so ME May not okay we can go ME Thats uh Youre right UI Yeah yeah yeah UI Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah ME Thats its less uh Yeah ME But its its nice because people anyway dont go there ME But So what do you think for it usefulness UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah mm UI So d Yeah we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on LCD ME Seems to be useful UI So so Yeah ID Let me understand well because Im not sure thats for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button ME Both ME Yeah ID Yeah two Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Up down or left right UI Yeah UI Up ID Yeah ME Yeah ID And which what is that ME That Cool PM Its a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the LCD screen UI This is jog wheel ID Okay okay UI Yeah ID Its a kind Oh okay okay PM Like selecting the menus UI Um see in LCD like you will have blocks and you select which one ID Oh oh okay great ME I would say then uh Two or three ID Now its looks us useful UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Two or three UI Yeah UI Two maybe ME Two ME Okay two ID Yeah ME So size and weight UI Yeah yeah ME Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size real weight ME Or Because it Size is going to be that yeah UI Yeah its size al almost Yeah because it is The weight will be bit lighter ME Uh and and Its going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy f I mean for my daughter for instance UI We will s We use titanium PM Sure without titanium alloy its going to be light ID Mmmm UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Of course UI Heavy UI Yeah ID Mmhmm UI Yeah ME Not sure if uh she can use it UI But sides uh the sides should be okay ME So should be okay UI Yeah mm ME Up to three for that because Im havent seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape ID Mmmm PM Okay UI Oh PM Okay ID Uhoh ME Well so colour it seems that we have the several colours for the LCD UI Yeah ID Yeah ME But um its not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case ID Yeah UI The case is silver titanium no ME Its a its going to be titanium ID Yeah its UI Yeah ME Okay okay ME Thats nice ID Lets imagine ME I think its good ME Okay ID And what about the strawberries on the top ID Im not convince ME Yahoo ID But maybe Im not trendy ID But uh Yeah but uh uh theyre not useful ME Well y you know its this uh fruit and vegetable year UI Oh UI Yeah yeah ME So Uh I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness UI Yeah ID I I mean it thats uh Mmhmm UI So maybe I think Yeah ID Yep UI Yeah well Yeah ME Whether its fancy or not now it we have to decide UI Um Yeah well then its bit difficult to use ID Hmm ME But this If its Uhhuh ID I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful ME So that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead ID Yeah UI Not like this d Were just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction too ID Mmhmm ID But the n Yeah UI So maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges stuff for strawberries and different colours ID Mm UI So its Even These buttons But it looks really not really good ME So it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh I suggested three ID No Im not sure uh why uh if it was like this I Its n no its not fancy any more UI I mean the f Yeah UI So these are kind of rubber things UI Even if you lose one you can just put whatever ID Okay PM And Moreover moreover it covers it covers all the end goals UI Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits and Yeah ID Uhhuh ID And different routes ID Okay I see what Okay so you you you feel like its something uh a protection for the remote control PM Even if it is you know its very rounded but still you got some rubber fruit here and its completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah weve yeah we have sensors here and so here and here so we just Yeah so even if you dont put it works ID Also UI But this is really fancy ID Okay ID Okay ME Because uh everybody s doesnt seem to be convince although its quite You have good arguments PM Okay PM Okay UI Yeah UI Yeah ME But And uh the last one is adaptive ID Okay ME This is not r maybe not as important as the other one but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use UI Yeah PM Sure sure just look at it ME Great PM Its full adaptable ME Fully adaptable ID Wow thats a Yea Yeah its fudge titanium PM Yeah you can fit it into your palm you know ME Thats Yeah ME So you can fit into your palm okay ME That What else can we need UI Yeah UI You can Yeah ME You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ME Its fudge yeah yeah ID You know ID Right yeah PM Mm Its two point one seven ME Yeah fruit titanium yeah ID And uh Okay ME Well I if if this is if you are ready to do that then I think it deserves a one UI Yeah ID Lets go for one ME Okay UI Yeah ME Now we have to do the average UI Three three six eight eleven ME Who is good in math ME Okay ME Two point one seven ME Thats nice ME Two point one seven out of seven UI Hmm ME I think we have a good good thing ID Yeah ME Well thats all I had to say about the evaluation ME So It seems to be good yeah ID So its a good evaluation ID Yeah UI Yeah mm ID Mm ME We have uh Yeah UI Yeah two one one seven we have UI So Financi Energy ID Mmmm ME Yeah ME Okay ME Thanks ID Okay ID So now it has to fulfil the financial criterium ME Ahha ID So I have an Here ID Um ME So so how many batteries do we need UI Uh we use bat One battery ME One battery UI Yep ID Okay so two ME Good ME Why two UI Oh we just need one I guess ME Say no ME No ne never install ID Uhhuh ME Two batteries or one ID Oh UI No number is one UI We need only one battery ME Only one ID Yeah yeah but the price is two ME No no ID Oh number ME But no no PM No uh you just Number ID Sorry sorry sorry UI Number number ME No no way ID Im sorry ME Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ME You never use uh Excel ID Oh ID No never ME Good PM How What whats the limit ID H Okay PM Uh its its okay that I dont know cause uh its not my field ME Its twelve bucks PM Twelve bucks ME Twelve bucks PM Okay now Mmhmm ME Twelve and a half I think UI So we We have sample chip PM Check that number also ME Okay ME Okay electronics ME So Its a simple chip UI Uh like simple chip yeah ME Simple chip okay UI So yeah ME One UI Yeah UI Four buttons at least ME Okay UI And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition ID And for the One also ME One or two UI Yeah one to one ME One UI Yeah one ME Okay ME So the case which one uh is it in the end UI Yeah I think we will go for a single curve no ME Lets do a single curve UI Oh is Oh PM Its its flat ME Its flat and curved UI Oh okay ID I thought you can curve somebody PM Its flat PM But it is flat you Look ME Its curvable PM Its curvable but its not curved ME Maybe there is a supplement for that no ID Mmhmm ME Its only curve ME Okay lets go ID Oh see I I think that the the price is this one UI Yeah ME This Okay you d We tried we tried ID Yeah yeah ID Dont chip on me UI Oh PM Oh okay ME So what is it UI Titanium ME T titanium ID Mmhmm PM Mm ME Mm thats expensive ME Mmhmm ID Mmmm PM Mm ID Yeah ID But she wanted u the fudge titanium ME Okay UI Yeah well No only one no ID I think its five but you dont say ME Lets stick to s titan ME Special colour ME No because uh Yeah PM Well n Why three ID Mm PM Why three ID Oh sorry ID Again Im See it UI Um Interface ID Special colour or its only on the Yeah but there is no colour here ME Oh UI Yes in LCD display UI Ok Yeah an Yeah ID So I put it here UI Pushbutton ME So the LCD Two ID How many pushbutton UI Scro Uh two ID Three or two ID Is there The scrollwheel okay UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Its going to be expensive UI One scroll wheel UI One LCD displayed ID Okay ID Um Thats thats not We choose this one and not this one ME Thats all ME No UI Yeah ME Oh I think no its Uh is it a scroll wheel and pe push button th this centre one UI Yeah its cheaper ID Or only a scrollwheel UI Yeah ME Or only only scroll wheel okay UI Only scroll wheel UI Yeah mm UI So Its already Ah ME You are trying to make make up make us up ID You try to s No no no ID Because how do you do to y select ME No but you select with the two d the other two buttons no UI Y ye Yeah ID Yeah I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you Stay longer ME Thats true ME Yeah UI Then it automatically we can just do like you feel it goes ME Yeah UI And it will activate Um plus yeah its price is really Special colours yeah ME It should stay ID Okay ME Yeah ID Oops ID Okay okay ID Um Mmhmm PM For buttons UI Okay UI Yeah buttons and strawberries PM No buttons just normal UI Yeah UI Special form ID You you have all of these no ME Shes very hard on this ME Special colour ID Mm maybe n not this one but Yeah so Not special colours an interest in ME Yeah ME No ME Special material UI Uh we have titan Yeah PM Thats for buttons PM But buttons are standard ME Yeah buttons are the standard buttons ME Yeah ME Its only buttons these ME Nothing special ME Okay ME So we are at seventeen dot eight ME No the colour is in the LCD ID And buttons are not colourised ID They are m Boohoo ME I no UI Mm hmm I think uh because you can just go for a good colours ME We can just use this red UI Yeah and uh Yeah ME Its So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ID Its already too expensive ID Apparently ID Yeah ID Mm ME Uh until we get twelve fifty ID Mmhmm ID Mm UI Oh ID So think of what we can cut uh here ME Well if I look at what is the most expensive things uh its the LCD and the speaker UI Sample speaker UI Yeah ID Apparently we have to choose one or the other ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Well as you may know theres some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng I mean producing electricity from mechanical energy PM So the point is that when you take device and push the button you produce enough energy to make electricity ID But you dont need a battery PM Yeah that you dont need a battery ID Mm ME Mmhmm PM So its something like hand dynamo robot PM A real hightech version of it ME So that would So but if we select the hand dynamo its okay we only We we win one ID But um its like the hand dynamo no UI Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand is Yeah PM Okay but l Why not ME Thats already that ID Uh its a its a beginning ME Okay lets do that UI Yeah ID Okay PM Lets do that ID So One here and here UI Yeah just remo S Yeah ID Kay PM And I propose to So uh about chips PM Advanced chip on print right ID Mmhmm PM So put minus one there please ME Im not sure if this is legal ID Mm PM Why not ID Thats right UI Uh no PM And ME And ID M maybe minus uh three no ME No UI Yeah ME Okay lets see PM So was there result UI No no UI Its not Its not changing no PM Lets have a look ID Mmhmm UI It you dont So now on we can increase our Still you have two more ME Yeah yeah yeah if Click somewhere youll see features PM Why ID Mm PM Oops ME Yes it does ME Maybe put minus two so it looks uh more reasonable ID So Oh sorry PM Yeah PM Why not ME Yeah anyway No minus two PM Minus ID Mmhmm ME Nobody will know ID Mm ME Its not recorded is it PM Good ME Okay were on time ME Good ID Okay ID Oh we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want UI Maybe we can use it for our party PM And a battery and a battery yeah ID Oh UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID Both its its cool ME No now we are exp exceeding I think PM Now its fancy lets add one instead of two UI Yeah that No but point five point three ME It Is it ID Mm ID Yeah yeah y Yeah ME I think were exceeding now ME We have to remove the Uh its better UI Okay ME I think they are counting uh We would prefer yeah UI Is really strict ID Mm ID Its maximum and dont have to Yeah yeah ME Maximum is maximum UI Oh ME So remove one of them ID Uh Uh mmmm UI Oh yeah ME Yeah ME Okay ME Okay were uh on target ID Yeah ID Mm ID Okay ID Mm ID So target reached ME Im just curious to see this uh my address chip on print UI Ho Oh ID Its um English uh Yeah ME Trick ME Uh I would say its the Russian trick but Anyway No they may have some their origins strange origins No no no ID Yeah but uh is uh English ID So Mm PM Well I dont know UI Uh And we can discuss all these things in our party PM I dont know PM I am not sure who was programming this calculator you know PM Cause uh I wonder if we put A or B somewhere instead of a number ID Mm lets try ME Lets finish this meeting instead ID Okay ID I save it uh Okay so next mm No thats yours ME What else ME No ME This is right ID Sorry ME Okay so finance thats done ID Kay ME Are the cost under twelve UI Mm yeah very much ME Yes ME Project evaluation good ID Okay ID So now We have to make um Yeah PM Next slide ME Project process ME Safe uh asse uh safe assessment ID Yeah ID Mm ID See mm how Are we a good team ID Mm ME Yeah I think weve listened to everybody PM Okay ID Mmhmm ME Everybody could say what they thought ID Mm ME And uh Yeah ID Is there enough room for creativity PM Yeah yeah UI Yeah yeah ID Mm ID And you PM Yeah ME When we see the results there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership UI Yeah its really Yeah ID Mm ID Oh ID Okay ID Well project evaluation PM M maybe not huh ME Teamwork very strong I would say UI Yeah our teamwork is really strong ME Teamwork no problem ME Means ME Whiteboard digital pens UI Oh we still I guess PM What was the Oh yeah what was good PM Everything ME Yeah I think whiteboard is useful PM What was bad ME Digital pens useful UI Hmm ME New ideas found ID So you say is there sheep ME Yeah ID Luck ID Okay ID So luck but good ID Which imply good uh team performance ME But uh Yeah but uh then I I mus Thats true PM Yeah PM A good leader you know a good leader is somewhere in the shade and Of course ME And theres uh one very important point UI Dont really ME Were on time UI Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Meetings finish when they have to or even before UI And we also Mm UI We made Mm ME The for meeting its uh one of the most important thing PM Uh Not to waste time thats important ID Okay ID Mm ME Yeah ME Yeah we have other uh remote controls to create UI Hmm PM We need time f New materials ID Okay UI Ah we got new idea speech recognition location finding ID A lot of uh Yeah uh new ways of doing financial Mm ME Mm UI New materials new s uh this fancy strawberry design ME Mm yeah ME Hey just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh UI And new tricks ID Mm ID Theyre working on um pink titanium ME They are working on a Okay good UI Ah very ME I think we are great PM Budget ME Theres no no other words for that UI Yeah ME We are probably the best PM Alright ID Mm yeah ME Real Reaction is uh Yeah ID Yeah were really nice ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Mm ID Okay ME Finished ID I think its Yeah ME Ah celebration ME Are the costs within the budget ME Of course they are UI Yeah ME Yeah ID Uh How Yeah PM Okay ME Is the project evaluated ME Yes it is UI Yeah yeah its We got two Good score PM Yeah it is ID Mm PM So we see we can even forecast PM they propose us like celebration everything we could forecast it right ME To whom ME To the whole our company ID Im the one proposing the celebration ID Of course you know Im the program manager PM You PM It was you PM Okay UI Oh okay ME So lets celebrate ME Uh I think the meeting The meeting is over at least ID Mmhmm UI So where we will go now ID Ah um I think its finish UI Uh ye Will go to Italian restaurant or Ah okay ID Yeah ID Mm ME So we have to go out UI We can decide ID Mmmm UI Yeah PM Okay ID And we go to the party UI Yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah UI Thank you ID thank you to you ID Mm,"This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership."
PM Hmm ID Good morning everybody UI Good morning ME Good morning PM Good morning ID So we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television ID And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly ID So people can can use it without any any problem ID I dont know UI Well I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Yeah from the account manager PM Mm PM B did you send us an email about this ID Uh not yet but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail PM Yeah we we received an email about this uh d designs PM Ah its Okay ID Or Uh ME Or you can put it in the shared folder PM Yeah you see the email PM You email PM The v very no no the first one ME No I didnt get it PM Its inside ME This one PM No no ME No PM The third one PM Oh you didnt get anything ME No PM Its strange PM Mm PM I got an email about the dis about the discussion PM Yeah ID You get email PM I dunno from who PM From the account manager PM You have received the same email right UI Yeah PM Yeah ME I think its for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information PM Yeah UI Yeah I think so PM Yeah so each of us has a role to do ME Yeah I think assign your uh roles ID S For each for each one PM In each We already have our role ME For each person yeah PM Kay we can So there are three kinds of designs thats all ID So there are so we have three f yeah ID We have functional design conceptual design and detail design PM Okay alright ID So who will be the the responsible for the functional design ID Any any volunteer UI I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager PM Yeah yeah UI Uh No Im doing the interface PM Im doing the interface ID You are doing th PM Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay UI Yeah I Im Im Well maybe we have okay so I industrial design UI It was a little confusion about my uh but its alright ID Okay Ill for industrial design UI Yeah ID Okay ID And and you Norman PM Mm PM Um working on i UI User PM User interface ID And And doing the marketing ME Uh Im into marketing ME yeah nothing much in the project ID Nothing related here to the Next ME Marketing in this design ME A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface PM Yes PM You see the second mail PM Yeah its inside PM Go down PM Appendix ME Yeah this is PM See theres a role for everybody ME Yeah thats right first PM Even for the marketing ME us user define PM But look at your role your marketing role ME Theres a trend watching ID I dont know PM Yeah thats your role ID I UI Well I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well w we want to have a new re remote control for for TV distribution I guess ID About the design or Maybe well discuss this later no ID Mmhmm UI So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work ME Yeah PM Mm PM Yes ME I mean working remotes we already have ME This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls UI Yeah I dunno I Yeah ID What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics ID And of course it should not be very costly ME Yeah thats right ID So About the about what PM Mmhmm UI Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting or Yeah PM Need to collect information PM Um PM I Im part of design perhaps PM Uh what is most important in a in a remote control PM What is the most important function aspect PM Uh ID You mean the external or Yeah of g of course UI Well you have to make it work UI Thats the thats the big thing PM Thats alright PM Yeah it should be easy to work with UI Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah UI We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah yeah PM Uh PM We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface PM You just tell the television I want which channel PM Or or you can say for example um I want uh to list all the programme tonight ID You wont I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly PM Y you know instead of uh remote control its doing the some searching for you so you dont have to look for the channel you want PM Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight PM Or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight PM And then you list a few and I will choose from the list PM So instead of pressing the channel number I am choosing the programmes directly PM Yeah thats one way of uh making it useful PM No because no its not very a lot ID S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech PM Th this information exists PM For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything PM The the idea of using speech to reduce the button but uh and its more natural UI I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah PM Yeah ME Im a okay PM Yeah PM Yeah ME I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control ID In the hand ID Yeah PM Yeah ME If we are going to add a speech interface Im not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the TV itself could have it PM Yeah PM Yes possible PM Yeah UI Yeah PM But Yeah ME And I could talk to the TV television itself ID Except if if you are far from the TV ME I need not have an I mean we have some or something different technology but Mmhmm yeah ID This is its Mmhmm PM Yeah yeah PM But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function instead of choosing the ch TV channel theres a option you can choose either TV channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme UI On the content UI Yeah yeah its its a good idea its a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah PM So its more powerful PM Yeah PM No PM No because you see now all the TV programmes are available on the webs PM They they are they are they are available in XML format or whatever the format PM We dont care PM We just say that this are some content PM We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes PM Some of the websites they already provide this service so we can just use the service available PM Download it uh to the to this remote control PM And then theres there are only six buttons for six categories or sev seven ID Mm PM The most there are only seven buttons PM So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want so you dont have to choose among hundred channels if you have hundred channels you just have six buttons seven buttons ID Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons UI Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way so Yeah in the dis display on the TV screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah yeah PM Yeah yeah ID This is good idea PM Yeah PM Ah yes PM So PM Yeah PM Yeah so you dont have to display here just display on the TV screen right PM Good idea PM Okay PM I think I think that will be revol revolutionary PM Because all the TV uh the the remote control have all numbers lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end PM Yeah UI So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please Norman draw uh Okay PM Alright PM Okay ID So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so can we S You it PM Ah w w we have sometimes to use the whiteboard PM Five minutes ME And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So I mean if youre watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene the lights adapt themself PM Okay PM Okay PM Yeah PM Yeah ME The lighting in the room changes PM Yeah but we are designing just remote control ME I mean we have a option in the remote control ME If we want to have that option you press that button in the remote PM Okay PM Okay do you want to have a conceptual remote control there or you just want to put the function in ID Yeah ID If if you you you can if you want you can use th the PM Go on draw something ME Oh Im afraid you forgot to put your lapel PM Mm PM Where is it ME The lapel ID Or before the before the the design that says PM Ah okay PM Where where is it PM Here ME Yeah that one ME Just plug it ID Norman ME Yeah thats right PM Mm ID Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the PM Mm PM Okay alright PM So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content ID Yeah PM Right PM We agree on that right PM Uh uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons ID Okay ID Yeah PM Uh to choose uh content s or channels PM So we have both PM The user can choose w which one they want right UI Yeah by content or by channel its a good idea PM By content or by channel PM Choose by contents or by channels PM So And then what did we say just now PM Other than this UI And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents ID Mm PM Okay so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content UI Yeah PM Challenge UI I think i its not very difficult to to browse by channel but its a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think thats the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting PM Okay PM Content PM Okay so these we have to work it out PM So this one of the problem PM And uh The main thing PM Okay PM Alright PM Alright okay PM So we are well discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer PM Thats the first aspect PM Right PM We will get information and then well come back in UI Okay UI Thank you everybody ID Okay PM Yeah well come ID So maybe well meet in maybe five minutes ID And well discuss the other other aspects PM Alright PM Alright okay UI Okay ID Okay ID Well thank you all,"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. The group set an agenda for the meeting and discussed the materials sent to them by the Account Manager. They discussed and explained their roles in the project. The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product. They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content, reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options, and adding a light adaptation system. All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting, the functional design meeting."
ID So we come again for the the second meeting PM Mmhmm ID Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one ID And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control PM Okay UI Okay ID And we have think I got a new project requirement ID So I think uh teletext becomes outdated ID So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet and I think we dont need lighting adaptive so the remote control should be only used for the the television UI Okay ID And of course we should have our image in the in the design ID So lets start with the the industrial designer UI Yeah alright UI So uh Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here ID Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want ID Here ME Just go to explorer ME Or open ID Oh okay ME Participant two UI Participant two ID This one UI Yeah ME Open uh UI Uh open ID Do you want to open Ah PM Because its open you mean UI Right so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television PM F five ME Slide show view slide show UI So uh can you go one page down please UI So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do UI So uh mm Im thin uh I think uh I Ill do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use UI Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like UI And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that UI And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that UI Okay so can you go down uh So wha what I think for now is we dont want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the UI Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication UI And the communication with the TV set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the TV set PM Did you draw it ID Wow PM This ID This PM What is the other chip for PM The one on top UI The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well putting things together um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the TV set ME One is a communication PM For men PM To the in Okay UI And thats it UI I think we should use a FPGA for for the functionalities which is easy to to t Its field programmable uh something array PM Mm PM What is FPGA ME Gateway arrays UI Yeah ME Its a field programmable gateway arrays PM So whys it how is it different from the Bluetooth UI Well uh a FPGA is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want PM Yeah PM Programme it ME Yeah PM Okay UI And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices PM Yeah PM Uh So this are the they have to work together PM Or PM Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay UI No UI Well th the FPGA will produce the the data to send ME Or its something like isnt hardware the first one ME And the second one is for the software PM Is the is the software par alri okay ME Yeah to run th to make it run UI Yeah ME Thats it PM Okay okay PM So you can control if you want right UI Yeah ME No UI Alright and thats it for the working design UI So if you have any questions PM Mm ME Okay and how about the battery power ME Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared UI Uh no no no no I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t ME Into the more compact and uh okay UI Yeah yeah UI And uh I I dont think it will need um very uh much power to make it run so Yeah PM Mm PM Mm ME Yeah yeah PM Mm ME Okay PM You can put it on the charger when uh you when you dont need to use it UI Its a good idea ME Yeah thats right PM Yeah ME Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always PM Yeah yeah UI Yeah ME People dont like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out PM Yeah PM Mm ME We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote we do not want to make it PDA PM Uh mm PM Y yeah yeah PM Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth if some people have PDA they can use their PDA to control the TV if they want to right UI Thats a good idea ID You can i yeah ID Ma Yeah we can change the b UI Also but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control PM I dunno ID Yeah UI S okay so charger for is the ID Um PM So is mine ID Its mine PM Oh ID Participant one no PM Yeah this your Yeah ID Mm ID Oh we have so lets move to to user interface design PM So you can open uh three ID Participant During the weekend PM Yeah PM So So Im working on the technical functions design PM can you show the next slide PM So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have PM So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah PM I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set ID Thats good ID Mmhmm ME G Yeah not the TVs PM For example switch on switch off switch the next channel and so on and so on PM So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah yeah yeah ID This are usual functionality PM Ours is a bit uh different PM So these are two example PM One is from the other one is from yeah uh engineering centr yeah ID Tasks PM This is the most competing prototypes Ive found PM But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah ID And they are small PM O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so its very lousy UI Yeah UI Of course ID Mmhmm PM So you so you move to the next the next one PM Yeah so I talk about the problem PM And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick so we dont want that ID Yeah PM So I propose the easy to use uh prototype PM You can navigate on TV screen and we can the users preference and we need to have the TV connected to internet so we end in order to access the TV programmes by XML and we need some to do some preprocessing PM From the technical aspect the processing should be done on the TV set than on the on the remote controller right PM And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may KIV ID What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the TV than the So we should have specific TV PM Yeah all the processing is done the TV is a compu has some processing power the Yeah UI So we have to t We have to sell a TV with the remote control too ID Or ID We can use this ID Yeah we dont Yeah I think so PM Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay ID J j just the remote control UI I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the TV set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes thats a good idea I think PM Yeah PM Okay ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah thats right PM Okay PM So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any TV any conventional TV sets ID Mm ID Yeah we ID Yeah PM Mm PM Okay ID Speech recognition PM N yeah thats all PM The next one PM So I come up with a simple design just keep the v navigation buttons ID Keep the navigation but UI We d we dont we we dont need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the TV so uh Well f four five buttons its sufficient PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Mm UI Its easy to build it does not consume much power ME Yeah thats right PM Okay thats all ME Oh but you have a catch there um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine then UI Well then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM No because you choose by channel so you choose by TV program so you dont have hundred channels to choose from ME Uhhuh huh huh huh UI Maybe you ME Mmhmm hmm hmm PM If you go by channel you dont have to do that UI but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right left up down well the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator maybe directly or So we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that ME But Yeah then yeah thats right ID So you are Mm PM Ah PM Ah a big jump PM A mouse or Yeah ME Mm hmm hmm ME Okay ME Okay PM Mm PM Mmhmm UI But well see ID How the this remote PM Uh its gonna be small ID Yeah of course small PM Yeah PM So itll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device ME too small that it goes under the sofa and we cant find it ME Yeah thats PM I dunno how bu And responds to you and I mm ME just give it a name and we call him ME Yeah thats right ME Yeah thats right UI Okay so uh next presentation Mm ID Participant four ID So Harry ME Okay after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here ME And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines and the users send the feedbacks and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a TV remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is UI Well I I think it will be a yes a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah PM But I think if you to recognise numbers its a wellstudied problem PM I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm ME Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones ME We just have the its not going to take much space also UI And this can allow to choose the the program for instance without uh adding uh buttons so its a good idea PM Yeah ME Its going to be very slim PM Mm ME And next one was the size of the remote control PM Mm ME It has to be of course a very slim and small one ME And of course most of the people are interested in if its less expensive so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a tradeoff PM Mm ID Mmhmm PM But Mm ID But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility ME The features and the cost PM Yeah PM I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost ID Yeah PM Maybe not less but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort yeah extra features ME Little bit more if its with extra features UI Yeah ID It Yeah UI Yeah s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well uh Well we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control so I well it will be alright ME Okay ME Yeah yeah PM Mm ME Thats right ID But is it useful or not u I dont know PM Yeah ID There is in the Mm ME I mean for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes PM Mm ME Or they say movie name or I dont go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel or volume up volume down brightness contrast PM Mm PM Mm ME So I think this should be a good idea to put this features ME And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages ME Mm I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if its not really required ID I think i If its necessary can you can do that PM What is the teletext PM Mm ID We can integrate small microphone in the remote so its not really a problem UI Yeah UI Okay ID What about lighting adaptive options ID According to the re to the new requirements I think we dont need that ID Yeah PM It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller ID Mm PM So you need s special TV sets to do that PM Or its its done via this remote controller PM Its very complex ME I mean I mean yeah its for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if its going to be working or not UI Yeah I think its a bit complex too For our next product our new TV set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light PM Mm ME I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing PM Yeah then we can conclude that PM Yeah PM Yeah but its quite possible but maybe not in this project ID So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes ID Mmmm ID So any things to to discuss ID Or any suggestions ME The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost ID Expensive ID Price PM Mm ME And the lighting adaptation and the teletext PM Mm ME And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions PM Okay ME If you are watching an foreign movie you get subtitles sometimes PM Yeah PM Okay ME And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French PM Mm ME And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German ME So the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages UI Function ME That should be a good uh point UI Yeah but well what about the the new projects requirement UI I I I think we should give up with teletext no ID I think we we can we is the UI Yes UI Well so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television PM Mm UI Because if Yeah but uh we can think that in a few years there will be TV set that can access the internet PM Using the TV to access the internet PM Or what PM I didnt quite understand Yeah okay ID Yeah UI So its a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years ME We already have some UI So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah ID So you have to anticipate the the future PM Yeah PM The future demand market demand UI Yeah ME Yeah thats right UI Yeah to desi well not not to implement it but to well to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah in an in an easy manner if is possible PM The functionality in the future ID In future PM Alright PM Yeah PM Because all the TV sets will be digital right PM All the programmes everything will be in digital than analog PM Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change UI Yeah yeah ME Yeah UI Okay ID Okay UI So Okay thank you ID So lets go for the the lunch break and we will meet after ME Okay thank you PM Okay PM Thank you,"The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities, and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote, and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. He suggested a simple design with few buttons, small size, and a locator function. The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages. The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television."
ID So we come to the third meetings ID I have good ID Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design ID So we will talk about some specific details UI Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh Im participant two UI Components design ID This Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting UI Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control UI So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy UI We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control UI Now Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didnt fou we didnt decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote ID But if we use battery We will okay UI So uh its a point to discuss UI Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices like wood rubber titanium or latex UI But uh well its not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view UI Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so PM Mm UI And uh this is the last point the choice of chips UI So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi wont work in a cluttered uh uh environment PM Mm UI So um so I think we can start with these two main things UI For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because its trendy and its uh its uh well its modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote UI For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper PM Mm UI And s so uh we can move to the next slide PM Sorry UI Yeah PM What is this single curved what does it mean UI Well uh uh i i its uh its the the shape of the um of the remote PM So its its not Yo l yeah UI You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the Yeah PM When you hold on it it is comfortable to hold UI Its more confog f comfortable that if these uh its completely flat PM Okay PM Yeah PM And the battery is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesnt matter UI Yeah the um thats the point UI The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy PM That thats what it means by kinetic PM Okay PM Mmhmm PM Okay UI But I d I dont know its if it is feasible because I dont know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy PM Mm PM Mm PM Okay PM Yeah PM Yeah PM We we might check with our R and D department to see if they have this product ready for market UI Yeah UI And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please UI So and uh thats uh that summarize well what I have said PM Mm mm UI So uh youre right we can uh see in our uh R and D uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy PM Wha Ah the department PM Mm UI Thats it PM Uh So I um keep in touch with the R and D department UI Oh yeah I take care its all right PM So the titanium case is the normal case that Ill show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not UI All right PM Cause I am not very sure plastic titanium or whatever UI Yeah PM Theres another point I want to make is that the uh well youve seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use Yeah PM Yeah maybe n Yeah ID Three PM So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data PM So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here PM The idea is to represent buttons as figures diagrams symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing ID Whats the function of this button PM Yeah PM Yeah PM So ID I think it makes the the interface really Graphical user interface PM Ea easy to use PM So next one PM function five PM So I can use the button the mouse maybe ID A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures PM Yeah PM So next line PM So the here are some examples PM So they cluster the buttons together PM They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well PM Mm but this interface are kind of confusing PM Uh basically there are too many buttons PM Right PM Next one UI Yeah PM So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you UI Mmhmm mm mm PM So I just got an email saying that PM And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that supposedly UI Yeah fine PM The next one PM Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the LC display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a LCD screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well PM Touch screen I mean ID Yeah PM Next one PM And some people propose a scroll button PM Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button PM Like the one we have here PM Uh next one PM So mm so there are a few aspects that I collected here ID Mmhmm PM So s basically this deals with special users children handicapped people old people and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable specially for children PM And uh mm yeah yeah PM And then they also secure uh covers to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings PM So But we dont have to integrate all these complicated features PM Im just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people PM Yeah so thats the point PM The next one PM And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover PM Mm maybe useful for children they migh you you they only see the buttons outside PM And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside PM So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside UI Yeah PM Yeah UI S a good idea PM The next one PM So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons PM At I see that that is useful for old people and then you dont get it lost PM But for our product we dont need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use UI Yeah PM And you can call your remote controller if you dont know where it is PM TV remote controller where are you PM And then he will beeps and to say that I am here for example PM Is it possible ID We should include speech synthesis in this case no ME Yeah UI Yeah PM Uh UI Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control ME Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM And uh this is another one where you can uh the the the part thats a V standing for the volume PM So theres a up arrow and a down arrow PM But you the see that in the V the V appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow theres a V like as as if its turning down so its confusing interface so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design ID Mmhmm UI Yeah yeah PM And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found PM Big buttons are convenient voice recognition helps push buttons scroll buttons spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools PM And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key PM Yeah PM So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used UI Hmm UI Yeah PM And basically uh Yeah UI Well I I think you its its its fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the TV screen I dont think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also so PM Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM Okay ID Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the TV UI Yeah UI Thats a good idea UI To have a help button PM A help button UI Yeah ID Yeah PM So you are display on the screen UI On the TV screen ID On TV TV screen PM So on the TV screen UI On the TV screen the uh how to use your remote ID So just you push the button and we will Yeah PM Okay PM Okay ME Oh PM Okay PM So that eliminates all the complicated documentation okay PM So wi Yeah ME But people are often enough looking at the help once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff ID If the if No In the case where they need help in the case where they need help UI Uh yeah ME Its a psychology UI In a marketing point of view ME Okay ME And let us see what the market demands ME We could just go to my presentation ID Yeah UI But uh wel well I think Uh well ID Its just for user customizable for kids or old people ME Yeah thats right PM Mm ME I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the Same remote with some Both yeah ID So So its the same Can be used by both kids and old people PM Mm PM Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller i it could be a cube is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons you turn the other side you get the other buttons so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls ID Maybe for kids kids they like uh t no l they like to Yeah PM Small Yeah UI So le le lets see what uh what people want PM Lets see the market demand ME And then we can decide what what we can yeah PM What what market yes yes ME So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes ME And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires ME Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions ME And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design ME So seventy percent of the users they find their remote controls very ugly they dont find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything ME And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy ME And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user ME And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot ME And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons theyre not used most of the times UI Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Yes ME So this were the findings which we found ME And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls ME Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV PM Yeah ME And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished ME So theyre frustrated a lot And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it UI Yeah PM Mm UI Mm the functionalities yeah ME So you can just see the percentage fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that its quite difficult to learn if its too complex UI Yeah ME So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them ME We should have an LCD on the rem remote control PM Oh UI Well mm w well I I I dont really see the advantage of having uh LCD on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen PM Big screen UI Its yeah of course its fancy trendy and so on but its its expensive to produce and its not really Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ME I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy ME So if we have a LCD on the remote rather than looking onto the TV you just look into a remote and navigate it ME Its the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control PM Mm yeah UI Yeah yeah PM Mm ME We just play around Yeah PM The thing Yeah UI Yeah but when you play with the iPod you dont have a big screen in front of you s Yeah ID You can use this screen instead of the big se screen instead of use the yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM If you reuse the existing screen we element eliminate the LCD after all the LCD just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful fancy as fancy as the one on the LCD maybe even better ID Hmm ME Yeah PM So Yeah ME I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah ME So the other one Yeah thats fine PM Yeah UI So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think LCD will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results PM Yeah PM More on a fancy design ME Yeah ME I mean thats Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Mm PM Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller ID But Yeah PM Yeah ME Uh yeah we have uh I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers PM So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an LCD will cost and then well decide again PM Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time UI So price of uh LCD display PM Is i if i Yeah ME And its always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls UI And Yeah PM Yeah PM And also the cost for the speech recognition ID Mm PM Ask our R and D department ID Its for its just for small vocabulary PM Yeah ME Yeah its o only for a limited vocabulary say eighty commands or so ID We its not yeah PM Yeah PM And ho Yeah ID Yeah UI Yeah okay PM And also the scroller button how much will it cost UI And Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button ID Yeah ME Mm the scroll button from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button ID Push push UI Yeah ME Because they they just theyre just frightened to use the scrollings or help button UI Yeah I think that Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality PM Yeah PM Dont use the buttons PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah ID It doesnt mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important PM Important UI Yeah UI But But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the TV screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you Yeah ID But they are just less used compar yeah ME Theyre not used much PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Mm PM Yeah yeah PM So so the at most more power uh ID Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others ID So UI But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that PM Yep PM Yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM Yeah UI You dont have to to switch to a channel to another uh Yeah but Yeah but if you look at the LCD you you dont look at the TV screen so i i its not really worth to get to have the image if you dont look at so PM Yeah ID Mm ME Or it could be like this as the people say if they have a LCD on the remote not on the television ME Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background we are most focused on the commands ME So if you have then LCD in the remote you just have a menu and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu in the LCD displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume then the program then the brightness contrast and all the stuff PM Mm ME And accordingly you can just increase or decrease PM Mm ID Its And I think its increases the cost of the the remote control if you use LCD PM Mm PM I if Mm PM Mm PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah that has to be checked out PM I think that theres no contradiction here because if there are few buttons you dont have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel just tell your channel and then you dont even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for LCD with the help of speech recogniser you can Yeah ID I You will listen to a peep special peep UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay ME I mean better if we could just check all the cost with LCD and also with the speech recognition PM Mm UI Yeah ME And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case PM Mm PM Mm PM Yeah PM A and Mm ME And the third problem was to find the remote control ME Always so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes UI Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t Yeah ME So Yeah thats right thats exactly what I mean by voice commander PM Where yeah ME Or it could be also something like this uh its always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control so we have some one charger there and whenever we dont use the remote control we put it in the charger PM Yeah PM Mm UI Yeah PM Put it back at the charge UI Put Yeah PM Yeah ME And when were using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere in the charger we have a small button and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps wherever it is PM Yeah ID Okay UI And thats a good idea thats simple like in phones ID Yeah PM Mm ME I mean it doe it also doesnt require a voice command because there are problems with a voice command UI Yeah ID But you dont you dont have to move the the charger PM Hmm PM Mm ME Yeah yeah yeah ME I mean charger would be fixed because its always with electricity plugged PM Th yeah ID You have to keep it UI Yeah PM Mm yeah UI Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery PM Yeah ID Okay PM Mm PM Mm PM Theres mm UI Also and uh uh the remote is lost PM Mm PM Yeah ME Yeah thats right PM That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button the off button the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen please charge charge me UI Yeah PM You never get it lost because uh every time youre off the computer the TV you are asked the the command the TV com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger ME Its an good reminder yeah thats right PM Yeah PM So you will never get lost yeah UI Okay ID Maybe for some people lazy people PM Yeah PM Yeah because everything is programmed inside ID Yeah yeah PM So its its uh its all about strategy y Mm ME And of course the final point is a fancy look ME As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they werent fancy I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons PM Mm UI They were ugly UI They Well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original so Yeah PM Yeah yeah ID Mm ME I think we should have something it I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if its like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it you cant avoid him PM With uh two two two parts controller ME But you can have an button for child lock PM Yeah UI Yeah PM Mm ME So just by pressing the button with some code you t you put a lock onto the remote so that he cant use even Mm uh Thats right PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm UI Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the TV you can uh well write a code or choose a category if it is kids uh things like that PM Mm PM Mm ID Or Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so its automatically PM Mm PM Yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM these are probl yeah PM Mm PM Mm PM Mm ID So if he ME I think these other four points theyre the market demands and so its for the user interface design and industrial design to just think Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included UI So for mm yeah PM Mm ID Yeah UI So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use where to use and s uh and so on UI Yeah PM Mm PM I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them UI Yeah PM If numbers theyre easy but if name the channel by by name Mm ID Mmhmm UI Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the TV you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh Thats right yeah yeah ME No we have a problem there ME You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something and if the score comes twenty four thirty five youve just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five ID Yeah its yeah ME So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying TV twenty five and just ordinary twenty five PM Mm UI Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the TV so PM Yeah PM Mm UI Yeah yeah ME Ordinary twenty five you almost theres a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and TV twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent UI Yeah but well okay PM Mm PM Mm ID Mmhmm PM Mm ME So its better to have some prefix before the number PM But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers ME Yeah something some code PM You say numbe channel number five of the TV correspond to something else in the channel UI Yeah yeah PM So some people may want to say I want to see this channel UI Mm mm UI Well I Yeah ME That will be too big ME And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also ID Or just Its difficult to to just say the the name of the channel PM Yeah PM Check with the v R and D department the capability of recogniser PM Uh ID It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel ID Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary PM Well its convenient for the user ME Als might be you just forgot the channel name you kno only know the number ID Or maybe Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary ME Then Yeah the PM The uh uh mm PM Mm PM I I think that I have mm mm I think theres another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example then what you can do is that the you can make the TV screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel so lets say its a four by four matrix of the images so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time you just use the control button uh you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel PM So Mm ID Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel PM So you you dont use the speech recogniser in that way ID No ID Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself PM Oh okay PM Yeah UI Well I uh I also I I also think about uh another problem if if there is uh more than one person who is watching TV the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two ID By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own ME Yeah yeah UI Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so its a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching TV and say oh TV thirty and just run s Yeah yeah PM Mm ID Or you have to s Yeah PM Yeah I wanna watch this I wanna watch that ME Yeah PM Mm ME A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem ME If we are using the television in the different environments say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company PM Mm ME So I think we should specify some prerequirements if we want to use a voice commands say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something ID Mm UI Yeah ID Or we can switch on or switch off the the special yeah ME Yeah thats right that should be an option PM Mm UI Yeah thats well I think thats a good uh a good option because its simple and uh simple to implement also so PM Hmm ME I think these are the practical problems ME So we need to take care of them in the design ID Maybe well discuss them in next meeting ID Its time to close this meeting UI Okay PM Well you you stay a five minutes ME Okay ME Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay ID Yeah ID Okay UI Okay UI So I see ya ID Thanks for your collaborations ME Okay ME See you another thirty minutes,"The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons. The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push, scroll, or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer."
ID So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control ID So PM Okay ID So lets see the what did you prepare PM Yeah so can you go out to the shared folder PM Mm the shared folder ID Sh share folder for th your presentation PM Yes PM We have a presentation ID Because I have here Okay just one PM Uh So I got the participant uh three PM W uh PM Three PM Its the final design yeah PM S so so I discussed with Guillaume UI Mm PM Right UI Yeah PM And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an LCD or not because its too expensive PM So we come up with two versions PM One with and one without LCDs PM Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module PM And detachable big buttons for all people um PM So UI S okay so Ill show you the the two prototypes UI Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh LCD um display UI You you can s here UI And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joysticklike uh button PM Mm UI You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it its considered like a enter function PM Mm PM Mmhmm UI You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here UI And here the the switch that control if you want Well I I I think uh its the Yeah but Yeah ID Why you why you you put it in the the side ID Its not a good place maybe PM No i i its the all around camer uh microphone isnt it PM The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere ME Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array UI Well so its a microphone array ID Oh its very costly microphone array ME Mmhmm UI No its just a single microphone and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your LCD you will be close to well its better to to to place it here th than here for instance PM Yeah Mm ME Yeah PM Yeah yeah ME Okay UI And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off UI And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger ID How much does it cost this one UI Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars but uh well its not its not uh yeah but uh its just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila PM For the Yeah ID Fifteen dollars ID Ah its above its above the budget ME The cost would be le reduced UI Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars PM Mm PM Hmm ID How many b battery is there UI How many excuse me ID Battery UI Well uh f battery we use uh about uh Yeah PM Is it n the two AAs batteries in it PM AA rechargeable batteries UI Rechargeable of course because we have the charger PM Yeah rechargeable batteries PM We have the charger so its no problem UI Yeah and you just On uh yeah one battery ID So one one battery ME Is that two or one ID Its kinetic reserve PM Actually uh its a flexible thing PM You just n uh Yeah yeah ME Now what is the whole day rating for that UI The excuse me ME Whole days rating ME What type of battery UI Oh yeah its just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like its exist ME Something like a two A A three size batteries UI Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah UI So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone its alright PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Mm UI Then the next time you pick it oh it works PM At uh yeah PM I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there b this button yeah alright UI Yeah just explain the button uh Norman PM This button is like the mouse is like a joystick you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button ID Mm PM You can move up down left right or you can do a swing PM So a swing to the left a swing to the right defines other functions PM So even though its a single button but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement ME And the LCD is this one on the remote PM Yeah UI Yep PM This is the version y that comes with LCD ME Yeah PM Here I present another version without the LCD ID I think its not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed PM Mm ID If you Mmhmm PM Uh okay this is new prototype uh UI Yeah its So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration UI The second version is also simpler we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also UI So basically th its the same uh yeah ME Uhhuh and also the switch PM Yeah yeah ME Okay UI Basically its the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before UI But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation UI Press one button uh acting as a a enter button PM Mm UI So um yeah according to what you said its more robust to the user ME Mmhmm UI And uh its also cheaper to produce UI We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars ID No four dollars its good ME And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger because thats a major thats a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then PM Oh no th actually th well come to that point in our Yeah UI Yeah its its its embed in the uh speech recognition system UI So so Norman will explain to you PM W w Ill Ill come to that point later on ME Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm ID And we will we will serve the charger with this PM Yeah ME Okay UI Yeah yeah of course mm PM Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah ID With the remote control ID Okay so the price of the charger included in the Mmhmm PM Uh its a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh UI Thank thank you UI And so mmhmm PM Its that same charger that you can use for the handphone but uh again depends on the types PM I think we have to investigate more on that but Yeah ID The price should be below twelve and a half Euro PM Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design ID Well thats so We have we have just The price of selling is twenty five Euros ME Yeah people are willing to pay more but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Mmhmm ID And the price of production Thats for this basis function and if you want more you pay more UI Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features ME Or uh Something like customised PM Yeah well well come up to that the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more PM If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system so is uh modular PM Yeah yeah for example the LCD you can take it you can put it put it back in or you can use the other one or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah ME Yeah ID Yeah PM You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you dont wan you pay less for the system you see ID Okay ME Mm hmm hmm hmm PM So Its pretty flexible in the yeah price ME Hmm okay UI You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do and uh which channel you want to choose and so on ID But Mmhmm PM Uh yeah yeah you should present that ME And this is other one PM Yeah UI H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch TV up they come up with their modules they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here ME Mm hmm hmm hmm PM Yeah Mm UI We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons clearly labelled and it acts like the previous one you just plug in and it works PM Hmm PM Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful PM Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities PM But in addition with simplicity PM So thats the best idea the cond that thats our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here PM Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you PM The first one is the speech recogniser again its detachable or addon PM And then we also have security feature for example this here oop its very robust it doesnt break and the material whats the material again UI The titanium and so its very uh Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one say we start from four dollars to produce such a device PM Titanium material ID Titanium PM Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one again because this is AA batteries you can choose the types of battery you want ME Yeah thats fine PM Lithiumion may be a good one but you can replace it with cheaper one again you pay for what you get and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder PM So when you finish watching your TV and you the you t you turn off the TV uh and then theres this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger so so thats the or is it thats the reminder part ME Okay PM Yeah and um And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary so we didnt define the vocabulary so its up to the user to define so sorry ME Mm hmm hmm hmm PM And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of TV programmes by genre and this can be used by the adult or by the children PM So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the TV contents of the night PM So its pretty powerful and thats thats why the num buttons are reduced because of this feature PM Yeah PM And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh its quite clear from yeah PM And also like the and the fancy designs yeah PM Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the Yeah ID What whats Maybe yeah ID Whats the price to p to produce UI Uh its about it The without without the charger its about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems ID With with with the charge ME With the charger ID Okay UI Two dollars for the uh for the addon modules and finally three dollars for the charger UI So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the LCD which costs two dollar you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two ID We dont have charger UI Its about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars ME I think we can use Excel ID We dont have all the options PM Yeah ID Charger we dont have charger here either PM Yeah ID No its its below the the the budget UI But its just if you want all functionalities PM Yeah UI Excuse me ID Its below the bu the budget ME Yeah its a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands ID We Yeah ME I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then PM Yeah UI Yeah ME We can wind up ME Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions ME So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings and uh in the market the people are not really interested with LCD without LCD with speech recognition interface or without speech recognition interface but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is they want to have an fancy look and feel it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold ME And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative PM Mm ME Of course in that we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative ME And the third one is easy to use UI Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we havent yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the TV screen uh uh with just four buttons PM Mm ME Okay and if we go to the next slide here you can find these are the latest fashion updates and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year its going to be an year of fruit and vegetable so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable or whatever they like PM Spongy spongy PM Mm mm ME So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes PM Mm mm ME And the second thing is and if the material they really do not want it to be very hard as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium it should be somewhat spongy UI Okay PM But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ME Um PM We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy UI A sponge ME Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias PM Spongy ME One is fancy look second is innovative and third is easy to use ME So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote PM Mmhmm ME So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these say that we have a seven point scale from one to seven and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this UI Hmm PM Mmhmm PM Mm ME So now you have with LCD and without LCD so on this scale if it is true if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one or if it is false it doesnt it looks uh it doesnt look much fancy then you could just tell me seven PM Mm ME So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now one is with LCD and without LCD PM So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users PM Yeah UI Yeah PM But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ID You ME According to you no according to you designers how will feel does it uh with LCD and without LCD PM Mm ME Okay let us make this L and without LCD ME On on this scale the LCD remote control PM Mm ME How do you look how does it look PM Mm ME D is it very fancy or doesnt look much fancy UI Well it doesnt look much fancy Ill Ill say three or four ME And you both agree for that ID And you PM I think we can improve on the design UI Yeah PM Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design UI Its it it Technical aspects PM Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect functional aspect but also the simplicity ID Mmhmm PM As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help ME So I take three on with LCD UI Yeah a three ME So without LCD how would you rate it PM Yeah UI Uh four ME Four UI I think its its uh more easy to make f fancy things when its not complicated so removing the LCD um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look PM Yeah PM Yeah ME And in the sense of innovativeness with LCD UI Well its its the same for both so I will give a five six PM Mm ME Five with LCD and So without LCD UI Well five also uh Norman please PM Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of TV programmes by content because uh that is really innovative and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity few buttons weve uh A lot of functionalities ID Uh For LCD UI With lot of functionalities PM So that is uh that is uh for both th Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them ME No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness PM Yeah PM Uh the innovation is v is very high I think ME With LCD ME And without LCD PM Both UI Mm for both its the the same innovations PM For both PM Its the same innovation ME Okay PM So maybe I can put six to seven UI six lets go for six ID Without LCD PM Both ME No actually uh to make it with LCD you make more efforts ME So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with LCD y then when it is without LCD there is not much innovativeness UI Yeah PM Mm ID Uh no innovative yeah ME So we cant go I mean that what you are sayin thats what the design No its like this I mean on the LCD according to what I understand from your model is you have a joystick here and you have LCD you just press your joystick you get here a programme PM Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the LCD PM We havent really uh determined what are actually actually its good to have a LCD but what are we gonna display on a LCD UI Talk about Yeah but you have the same programme on the TV screen ID So lets remove it PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah but Yes exactly ME Uh then No on the TV you dont it doesnt display on the TV now ID But This is the problem UI If you have the LCD but if n Yeah ME LCD ME Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the TV ME Or then again you have a channels volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design so I mean So without LCD you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness PM But you cannot display all on a LCD PM Anyway for for the users who who who opt for LCD well give them the give them the LCD we give what the customer uh wants right UI Yeah ME And which do you recommend e easy to use with LCD or without LCD UI Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons and uh well t p the menu are clear wellorganised so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah I think sorry ID No its just if I I see the the f the rate I think its better to do it without LCD ID Because thats with LCD just will increase the price and I thi i they have the same rate so without LCD it will be Mmhmm ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates ME So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without LCD and without speech recognition PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Even then our product is going to be very good UI Yeah its cheaper to produce ME Yeah PM Mm PM S Yeah UI And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so Yep ME Yeah thats right PM I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect PM I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people PM For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons PM For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity so thats why we have the parental module ME Yeah yeah thats right PM Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it but but uh what Im trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people PM So in terms of easy to use I think its very user customisable PM User customisation is very important yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah so W uh I think its the same ME So without LCD I just take it five UI Six ID Mmhmm ME Or you want it to be six UI Um six PM Yeah UI Yes as you say with better uh yeah ID Without LCD ME S s oh I think its better to have this without LCD UI And to improve the the look ME As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without LCD it is going to reduce the cost also and its going to be much simpler to use PM Yeah ID Yeah PM Mm UI Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so so lets go back to our laboratory and Yeah PM Yeah ME So ID What a what what about the sys speech recognition PM To improve on the design PM Huh ID what about the integration of speech recognition PM The speech recogniser is a addon module PM Right ME Thats going to be an optional ME If somebody wants to buy it they can have it otherwise no ID Ah so its optional with the okay ME Its an optional PM Yeah UI Its optional yeah since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than Yeah ID I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control because maybe parents will lose these uh Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah but I mean if you have an addons the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents cant use it ID Or ma yeah ID Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or so mayb better if you have all this in the same Yeah ME In the same set yeah and and individual buttons to make them work PM Oh PM The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component and doesnt want the parental control because its a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them PM So we might lose the customer because of this PM I dont know what do you think uh ID So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional PM Yes exa what do you think I dont know PM You are Marketing Manag ME I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a TV or to the number or singles who have a television ID Uh I think it inc increase PM Yeah ME So based on that I think But you can make it on a single PC with three different options PM Yeah PM But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost UI Well its about the same because if Well you can if you had uh something li Oh no because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because its three different pieces uh to to to build but Yeah yeah yeah its I think its cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module but uh Yeah ID I think it i increases ID Hmm PM Mm PM Mm PM Yeah ME On the same PCB yeah yeah PM Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the youre gonna keep the same customer because the same customer will come back to buy other addons ME Yeah thats right PM So so Yeah i i so if dont dont buy now they can buy i in the future ME I mean you could just provide with an optional PM So in in that way youre actually keeping the cus the same customer attracting them to come back in again and again ME So its something like a Microsoft product update PM Were not trying to follow the Microsoft and we dont want to the m Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded it would be a good thing right ID And and we we we we we we dont want that ME Updates and we sell it ME We make updates and sell it UI Yeah PM Yeah it depends on the v production ME And uh whats the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ME Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types UI Well so Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I dont think it will uh increase the cost too much so Uh well but its a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that ME Do you require different types of PCBs and Or uh it could be like this the PCB would be the same for all but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all PM Mm PM Mm PM Yeah PM What we can change is to propose the customers with skins PM For example the i the mobile phones nowaday they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better ME Yeah yeah thats right PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah thats right PM Yeah PM Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh UI Sponge ME I think you need to look into the material PM Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing ME Yeah yeah UI Okay ID So Project evaluation project satisfaction for example UI So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say ME I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models ID I dont know we have to ask these question ID We have to give answers so Project evaluation PM I suppose that you this criteria is it PM Room for creativity PM This room is a bit small but but I think its okay for us to work with ME I feel its fine we know we dont need uh I think its okay PM Yeah mm UI That was good ME This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations PM Mm PM Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so its okay UI Yeah ID Mmhmm ME And the leadership was excellent ID Yeah I think so PM Good job good job UI Fine yes uh ID He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants ME Yeah thats right ME Yeah thats right ID Uh the teamwork was very very good UI Very democratic ID I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you UI Thank you PM Thank you ID Oh UI Alright PM Alright ME And new ideas found ME Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting PM Mm UI Come up with new product ME I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ID Less fancy PM Mm we I I know something we need more cakes more biscuits on the table while we have meetings UI Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think its its a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that but I think its alright PM Mm UI We achieved uh project goal I think ME Yeah that is within the budget ID De Without without LCD without speech recognition it will be simple PM Mm UI Its w yes more or less ME And the evaluation was Yeah thats right UI Yeah but Alright ME And the next is celebration UI So ME So Yeah thank you thank you very much UI So uh coffee machine ID Yeah free free coffee UI Okay PM Alright then we finished PM Thank you very much,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. The production costs were below budget for the basic models. The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements, and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used, which could be customized with skins. The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership, but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda."
ID Good morning ID Sorry ID Yeah busy job ID Good morning ID So Oh good morning everyone UI Good morning PM Good morning ID Id uh like to welcome you to our first meeting ID Ive prepared a little presentation ID My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes as will I ID Um Im the Project Manager of this project and uh well I will tell you on what actually is the project ID This is uh the agenda for our first meeting ID Um this is the opening then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other ID Well do a little tool training with these two things ID Well take a look at the project plan ID Uh there will be time for discussion ID Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product ID And then we will close this session ID Um but first of all we Id like to uh introduce you to this room ID Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table ID Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face ID Um there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face of course and this isnt a pie its a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also ID But please uh dont be afraid of them ID They wont hurt you PM Well Well uh Im uh and my uh function is User Interface Design I think ID Um well uh I said Im the Project Manager and uh Im hoping uh for a good project and uh Id like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project ID Lets start with the ladies PM So uh thats me UI Okay uh Im uh Im the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project ID Okay so I PM Me too ME My names ME Im uh Marketing Expert ME My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers ME So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other ID Okay well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company ID Thats good ID Um well I said uh were working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original trendy and of course user friendly ID And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product ID Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods ID It consists of three phases namely the functional design conceptual design and detailed design ID As you can see all of these phases consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far ID Okay ID But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here ID I already talked about the cameras and microphones but they are not of uh much use to us ID Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things ID They are smart boards ID As you can see you can give a presentation on them ID And uh this one here is a white board ID I will uh instruct you about that soon ID Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room ID Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder ID As you can see this is the same tool bar uh as is located here ID Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page um uh to go back and forward between pages and of course uh to save it every now and then ID Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board for instance like this if everythings okay but I first have to put it on the pen you see Im new to it too ID Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want PM Oh ID As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow its not such a fast board its a smart board but also a slow board ID Uh but you can write things and of course you can also when you click here uh erase things so we have uh est left ID And um you can also delete an entire page but we ask you not to do that ID Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results ID Um does everyone understand this nice application PM So we cant erase anything ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Well you can erase it with the eraser but uh you shouldnt delete an entire page but just create a new blank one PM Right ME S Good ID I will delete this one now because we dont use it yet PM Alright ID But you can of course erase when you make a mistake but dont uh delete entire pages ID And you can also um lets see I think its here uh change the uh colour of your pen for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five ID Um thats what you will need for our first exercise because Im uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal ID Its also to gets to know each other because um Im asking three things uh for that uh drawing to do it on a blank sheet with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour and also with different pen widths which I also showed you UI Okay ID Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word ID Well Im not very good at drawing but I will uh go first and um try to draw Or maybe you should guess what Im drawing eh UI Hmm ME No PM Its a sheep ME Dinos Dinosaur UI Seal a seal ME Beaver UI A be Mm PM A beaver ID Well it uh could be everything PM Its weird UI With a tail and a mouth ID Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle or a snail and But a turtle has PM It has wings ME Turtle UI Snail PM Well the snail doesnt have legs UI Okay ID And those are slow ID And I hope our project group will not be slow but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can ID Okay time for another animal ID Would you like to go next UI Sure ME No problem ME No problem PM Oh right ME Mm ME It was four months ME Nice okay PM Well UI The hell ME To make it a little bit easier PM Its a giraffe UI Make that cute PM Or a dinosaur ME No its a giraffe ME Kay ME I think its easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe PM Yes ID Mmhmm PM Giraffe ME Yeah the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck it can reach everything ME And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project ME So thats my favourite animal ID Okay ME Anything else you need to know ID Could you write the words uh underneath it ME Oh uh Tall ID Or more words UI Tall ME So kay PM Should I uh Alright PM So I can draw but uh Uh PM Well PM Oh UI B Bunny rabbit ME Its a mouse ME A bunny rabbit PM Oh wrong one PM Uh PM Well uh you can guess what it is I hope ME Uhhuh ME No problem PM Its a rabbit ID Little rabbits PM And uh well uh its uh quick I guess PM Thats uh my uh favourite animal ID Okay thank you UI Okay ID And our final drawing ME Bob Ross ME Dolphin PM A dolphin UI Okay um UI Uh I uh draw I Ive drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence UI One of the most intelligent uh animals in our world PM Right ID Mmhmm PM Well UI Yeah intelligent PM With an E UI Ive Ive uh Eraser PM You can try out the eraser now UI Pen UI Well not perfect but okay ID Okay well thank you very much ID I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group huh PM Not really ID Well nice animals nice words ID Sounds good ID Um back to business back to the money part ID Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros ID And were hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market ID And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max ID Okay well its time uh for some discussion ID Ive wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about ID Uh whats your experience with remote controls um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control maybe for which market segments should we aim or should we aim for all segments ID Uh well actually Id like to hand the word uh back to you ID Whats your experience with remote control UI A lot of buttons PM I always lose them ME Yeah UI And you always lose them PM Yes UI A lot of buttons which you dont use or who you dont use Complex PM Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Complex PM Yeah UI Not user friendly ME No PM search for the buttons which one is which and uh Well ME No ME Boring ID Boring its not fun to use a remote ME No UI Mm ME Black all black ID Mmhmm ME So yeah UI Black colours ID Well maybe we should try to make it fun ME Mmhmm UI They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal ID Mmhmm ME Yeah UI Uh ME The the angle you have to use PM Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls ME You had different remote controls for different devices UI Yeah different remote controls yeah PM Yes perhaps you can integrate them or something ME Yes UI Uh for the use of different uh devices PM Yes ME Yeah PM Your stereo and your TV and uh ID Mmhmm PM Perhaps thats an idea ME Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons so Flap yeah PM Yeah thats right UI Yeah but you could uh I thin uh theres a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need em PM And which you dont use PM Right ME Yeah okay thats possible but itll get very big the the remote control UI Thats possible so that you only get the No n n no just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch PM Yeah PM You should just give it to ME Mmhmm UI Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly PM Changing channel ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm UI Or uh the numbers of course ME numbers UI But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television ME On and off UI You only use those uh the first time or ME Yeah play pause stop UI So UI Uh ID Mmhmm ID So maybe a a minimalist design the least uh possible amount uh of buttons UI Yeah I think so yeah PM Yes PM But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it ME Mmhmm of course PM Because uh things for uh teletext I dunno uh w whats the name UI Yeah uh teletext ID Mmhmm UI think so UI Okay ID So you dont want to bother people with uh loads of buttons but on the other hand they need many buttons so they dont have to get out of their seat ME No PM Yeah ME Yeah PM But But if if its if its international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the TV or so uh that you can choose what you want to see UI Right ME Because I think a market will be all kind of people ME Elderly p el elderly young people so PM I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration or that you just should aim for the normal TVs that uh And the BBC UI Uh ME Yeah I think thats the better one because I think if you youre going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty I think UI Yeah I I understand PM Yes UI No PM Yeah I dont know if the they have that anywhere else though ME I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah we can leave that UI When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly ME Not that much UI So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television ME Mm PM Yeah ME Standard deliver ID Mmhmm ME Mm UI So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons UI You dont have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television UI In those in that Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control ME No but Yeah PM Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search ME Yeah th it its I think thats not Yeah okay PM Thats not Yeah thats right UI Its impossible UI Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext and on the other side uh just n uh regular television ME No PM Yeah thats uh UI Uh Yeah but uh they dont use the same signal uh on remote control ME I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this PM Well not everywhere ME So I think numerals UI Because you cant use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television ME Yeah but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code PM Yeah you can choose the code ME You can use which which type of television you have UI Okay UI Okay ME Thats no problem UI Okay ME But I think like the two pages on the same screen like teletext and normal television thats thats nowadays standard I think UI Okay but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television so that option is not uh optional for those uh people ME Simplicity ME Yeah ME Yeah yeah ME Mmhmm PM Yeah ME Yeah g available PM But the people have a new television and c if you look into the future then they want will want the button if their thing is broke ME True UI Yeah yeah ME Yeah UI So we should take that in consideration PM Yeah ME Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME Mmhmm ID Okay well any more ideas UI Oh mm no ME Of course ID No PM Guess not UI Thingsll come up ME Yeah ID Okay yeah well we have some time ID Lets see what more I have to tell you ID I dont think there is much left ID Nope ID Were starting to close ID Um our next meeting uh will start well were a little bit early but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes ID In the meantime uh theres time for some uh individual actions ID Um as you can see the different roles have uh different tasks ID And theres a ping ID Is it my laptop ME Yeah ID Yep UI Stop the meeting now ID Ah well thats good five minutes and uh the meetings over uh right on schedule PM Yeah meeting will close in five minutes UI Okay ID Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification ID The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design ID And this was the Interface Designer ID Or the Interaction Designer PM Hmm hmm UI Mm ID Or what was it ID PM No interface UI No ME Interface ID Interface Designer okay first guess was right ID Uh will take a look at the the working design UI No the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design and the in uh usability interaction Yeah okay PM No the Yeah ID Industrial Designer okay sorry UI Okay ID Lets just use the acronyms PM So So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote or uh or how I dont really Right ID Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach ID Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly I hope PM Alright PM Me too ID And of course you have your own uh expertise ID Well uh that was what I had to say ME Uhhuh ID Uh are there any more questions UI Okay ME No UI No ID No ID Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working ME I have one question UI Okay ID Okay one question UI Oh ME Where does it says we have to make a remote because I presumed She didnt know who ME Okay no no problem ID Okay were still going UI No problem ME No problem ID Okay well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly UI Okay ME Yeah ME Mmhmm PM Alright ID Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes then UI Alrighty PM Yeah UI Okay ID Thank you very much PM Yeah PM Okay,"The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the project. The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals. After the drawing exercise, the project manager talked about the project finances and production costs. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider when producing a remote."
ID Good morning again UI One question PM Yeah PM Choose a number UI Send UI Submit ME Yep yep yep yep ID All set UI Mm ME Mmhmm UI Yeah ID Good ID Okay ID Lets see what we can find here ID Okay ID A very warm welcome again to everyone ID Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting ID Um and this is what we are going to do ID The opening which we are doing now um and the special note Im project manager but on the meetings Im also the secretary which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting ID And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder so you can see them and review what we have discussed ID Um if Im right there are three presentations I guess each one of you has prepared one PM Yes ID Good ID And um we will also take a look at new project requirements um if you havent heard about them yet ID And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time forty minutes ID But I think we will need it ID Um well I dont know who wants to go first with his presentation UI Ill go first UI Okay ME Yeah UI Ill go first yeah PM Well ID You can go first okay ME Well shall I go first with the users PM Well everybody already has his presentation so you can adjust it ME I think well okay no problem ID Is there an order ID I havent And one question uh your name Denni is it with a IE EIE okay ME Ja precies ja precies ja precies EIE UI So UI Huh UI Okay um Okay um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control ID Thank you UI Its possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those UI Um well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary UI Uh when you press a button uh thats when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button ID Sorry UI Uh senses that a connection has been made and know and knows what button you pressed becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button UI Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let UI You know what a let is PM Yeah UI Okay UI And that makes uh the the infrared lights signal which is sent to the television set UI Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infrared UI Thats basically uh how it works UI Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls are that uh they are very easy to produce uh it is pis uh its possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips UI Uh and the technologys already available we dont have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals UI Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works PM Oh right ME Animation UI we tel There PM There is something turning ID Yeah its a little bug its in the in the smart board UI Okay UI Uh well the subcomponent I suppose that you understand what a subcomponent is is f in this example its the button UI Uh when it is pressed down um the switch is ter is uh is switched on so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh cooperation with the battery of course because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh Yes uh okay ME Infrared light UI Um w after its being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infrared bulb and from there it signals a Morse codelike signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set UI Okay UI S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control UI Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held so you dont have to uh uh wind it up or something or just is its its very light to uh to make uh to use it UI Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours and uh easy to use buttons UI But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too PM Yeah Ive got it there too UI And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry easy to use buttons UI Perhaps soft touch uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore UI And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs PM Yeah UI Okay well thats my contribution to this meeting and uh two of these this meeting ME To this meeting ID Okay thank you PM Shall I go uh next ID Yep UI So PM Kay ID Please PM So ME Smoking PM Well uh my names and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote PM Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls of how they uh they look and information from the web that I found PM Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set how you uh d what you described uh just early PM And this can be all sorts of medsa messages turn it on turn it off uh change the channel adjust volume that kind of thing PM Uh play video teletext but also t uh play CD if you use it your CD player the remote control will that one PM There are some uh examples of remote controls PM You can see they are very different PM The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera PM And the other is uh more user friendly little with big buttons PM And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it but uh the the essential stuff is there PM Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach because the customers have to use them and and if they dont think its usable they wont uh buy it PM A lot of buttons they may think from I dont need s as much as that PM Uh well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use PM But uh keep in mind the new functions of TV what we discussed earlier split screen and uh is that a function that you should have PM Because all the TVs will have them PM Or because of only a few and isnt really necessary PM And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance PM If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video it could also work with uh with the stereo because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing PM The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you dont have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything PM And it should be a user friendly clear buttons and not too much PM And that is my presentation ID Okay thank you UI Okay ME Kay ME Check PM You must still have it open ME Kijke Kay so ME Were going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control or just Yeah and the users actually ME The methods I I prefer is were going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more ME Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ME And then tho that section were going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section ME Okay ME Some data ME Younger people from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like LCD screens speech recognition e etcetera ME And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age ME The elderly people from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features and we possess less than two third thats two fifth of the market share in that area ME Goed so UI Hmm ME Kay ME Findings ME Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often ME So we dont have to make it very small like uh like a mobile phone or something but some somewhat bi bigger than small so you dont lose it that much anymore PM Yeah ME Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot so the buttons sh should be that small or shouldnt be that complex because we have to search for the buttons which one are you going to use UI Mm ME Next ME Important issues about the remote ME I think it would be better with a personal reference but okay ME Remote control has to have to have a low power usage because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour so the power usage is also one one time an hour or so with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries ME The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control so those they those have to h be find very easily ME And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera ME It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone ME My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden okay UI Mm PM Hmm ME So uh if thats k uh if thats the problem you also have to find it easily on the remote ME Buttons ME Like what all colleagues said have to have to be minimalized ME or should be covered or in LCD screen ME LCD screen is easy because we have the LCD screen we have the various options ME Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options so the other options would be gone ME And you dont see the buttons ME So LCD screens should be easy but an LCD screen the problem with the L sc LCD screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years dont use the LCD screen a lot ME So we have to that keep that in mind that if youre going to implement LCD screen you dont have to make it that hard to learn or to use UI Uh LCD screen as in uh touch screen ME Yeah touch screen yeah UI Okay ME The last but not least younger people are more critical about the features ME Because they use the remote control often more often and are more technical than the ol older people ME And the older people spend more money and easily on a remote control PM Mm UI Kay ME So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people but also somewhat on the elderly people ME And on my personal preferences I dont have any mo more time to come with that but like I said LCD screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons ME And it should be easy to use ME Especially the volume buttons the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels ME And that is it UI Okay ID Okay thank you PM Oh right ID Um well thank you all huh ID I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements PM No ID No ID Well then I think its a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them PM Res I did not UI No PM Perhaps the rest ME Ja Be television ID Oh well not in this presentation ID Hmm ID Should be in there ID Well I can tell you them uh from my laptop ID Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet PM Oh ID So thats uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext ID Uh the remote control should only be used for the television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time to market and of course would make it more costly I think ID Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty and you talked about that before ID And uh a last point but also very important our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design ID So we have to keep that in mind ID Um well uh according to our agenda its then time to take a decision on the remote control functions PM Mm ID So who has any idea about what should be on it and what shouldnt PM Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance PM Or with one uh d che only the TV ID Yeah UI Yeah ID Only be used for television PM And the video also or not uh ME Only the television ID Well it says only for television here huh PM Oh PM Alright PM Okay ID Makes it a lot easier huh PM Yeah UI Mm ME So yeah then you can yeah ME Requirements no ME Functions ID Mmhmm PM Then it should have uh on off and uh Yeah UI Yeah for Standby options yeah ME Yeah the basics then by a volume channel one till two zero numbers on it oh teletext doesnt have to be UI Uh yeah PM And per perhaps uh No ME Um other functions PM Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers ME Yeah I had Yeah yeah UI Two s two two digits oh okay PM Can you Dont know if thats got a name but Yeah UI Yeah I understand what you mean ME I think its I think its easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that because some TVs if you press the t one and then the two it be between five secs it make twelve and thats thats not relaxed to user UI Yeah UI It makes it twelve yeah UI Indeed PM S Yeah UI Okay UI Well not really And and there are some models that dont uh accommodate that function UI So d uh wh the Philips television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve ME Yeah ME So that it easy and fast UI But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Uh yeah think so ME Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah so you should have that one on ME Our main targets age are ME were ME Forty five plus or PM Mute misschien also UI Mm ID Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty and now we have current customers uh of forty plus ME Forties okay because because younger people as Uh younger people have now sixteen till to twenty five age are f eighty one percent interested in LCD screen ME From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent and thirty six to forty five fifty five percent so I think to um Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much two years ME You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel UI Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ME With the LCD screen its easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint and then you can use it again UI Yeah we we could yeah UI But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap UI Because LCD screens are very expensive ME Yeah okay ME Yeah but a you dont know True UI A touch screen uh probably uh even more PM An But do you But if you would do an LCD screen do we have don dont you have any buttons UI So true true UI But uh Well um is it possible to make an LCD screen uh how was the information ME Yeah it only says that this perce percentage like LCD screen ME Because yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical UI So perhaps we should we should focus on that LCD screen ME And if the only f Yeah because our target is sixteen to forty five UI Yeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh Is it possible to find out anyway ME Yeah you dont know how much it costs ME Yeah you dont know how much it costs the LCD screen ME No I dont have any costs here I only have percentages UI You know PM Or because if it only directs at the TV then you only have uh I dont know what you want to do with the LCD screen ME Yeah UI No an LCD screens just like uh like a drawn here UI Um just uh displays several buttons for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons such as channel and volume you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and its possible to p uh press them down just like a touch screen PM Yeah PM Oh right so you can Oh yeah alright PM So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen ME Yeah if you want to adjust like for example adjust the audio settings you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings so the other buttons are gone UI Yeah we can make it possible to do that yeah UI Yeah yeah PM Yeah alright oh right PM Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID So were going for an LCD screen PM Yeah ME I think its the most easier thing yeah PM Would be yeah UI Thats my uh Yeah ID And hoping that when we produce a lot it wont be too expensive ME No PM Well we had twelve fifty I guess for uh production ME Yeah UI Twelve fifty PM Yeah PM I dunno how expensive an LCD screen is UI Um PM Any guesses UI Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i if the young people are interested in LCD screens we should make em ME Highly ID Mmhmm UI And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls Yeah PM Yeah PM But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people but also on the older and will they use it if it only has an LCD screen ME Yeah but Um s forty six to forty five thirty three percent and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent ME But our our our whats it project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets to customers that are younger than forty PM Oh so still a little bit people Yeah thats right PM But you dont want to alienate the other uh But if they also buy it then its alright ME No that not now but so Yeah but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger PM I guess UI Yeah PM Yeah PM Alright ID Okay so LCD it is PM An Yes UI Mm ID Okay UI Its treasure ID And what else UI I hope we uh h and lets hope to reach those uh those sales ME Yeah i i if it Yeah if it costs gets too much too expensive then yeah we should be sticking to rubber buttons PM Yeah UI Yeah can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of LCD uh screens ME N nothing no costs at all PM Yeah UI Uh so if you uh Yeah so if you uh you receive an email about that uh can you post it in the or shouldnt we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder PM But perhaps later so uh Yeah ME Yeah in I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything PM I dont Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if its uh too expensive UI Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert ME Yeah okay Ill Ill post it UI I uh Yeah sure sure ME Yeah ID Yeah okay ID But for now its LCD ME Okay LCD yeah PM Yeah ID Okay ME Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly PM The LCD ME Yeah and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy PM Oh thats a bit of a problem PM Oh thats a bit of a problem UI Mm ME Tha i l i itll look fancy with LCD screen UI Its looks fancy one yeah of LCD screen PM Yeah but they dont they dont like it ME Yeah ID Yeah PM They think its ugly PM When it has an LCD screen ME Yeah just a the plain remotes not not specific LCD remotes PM Oh alright I thought that you said that ME So Mmhmm ID Yeah and maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote because its new as far as I know PM Yeah ME Yeah of course UI Mm yeah ME And then you have the other thing that seventy five percent zap a lot but thats not a f question with the LCD screen UI And then not yeah UI Um ME Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time to get all the fingerprints off it UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Mm UI Okay ID Okay what else does our remote need ME Um Mmhmm PM A mute button ID Mute button PM I think ME The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection volume con selection and power s power usage PM And Yeah UI Yeah ME And a teletext but that is not of the question PM But But shouldnt you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ME Other things are Sorry ME Yeah it could be PM Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill ME Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Yeah and we could make an a a separate menu on the LCD uh screen for teletext ME Yeah teletext UI Yeah PM Yeah UI And theres also a A sh but in a sub submenu or something like that ME And other other less important things are screen settings audio settings and channel settings but Less important PM Yeah they are less important but I think they should be there or not ME Yeah should be there but not press Yeah submenu yeah UI Uh I think its also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English uh to not use batteries and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure ID Mmhmm PM Like with a with a mouse you have not yeah UI Indeed UI So uh you can mount uh the the the uh uh the remote control to um to refill the Yeah ME Yeah in a breath its Charted ID Mmhmm PM We should think of the twelve fifty we have but I dont know how much thats going to uh Yeah ME Yeah but we dont we dont have any costs now so Yeah UI Okay because i uh when you get an LCD screen you run it on batteries the batteries will be uh empty very soon very fast ME Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things PM You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off UI Yeah PM If you have an LCD screen thats burns all the time I dunno UI Yeah yeah UI Yeah PM You shouldnt on and off because thats ver extra that you have t first you have to turn the remote on and then you can uh I dont know ID Mmhmm UI Uh And go to standby mode when you dont use it so that Yeah automatically ME Yeah I think its its not that easy because I dont think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it so I think its better when th the TV shuts down the remote shuts down PM Nee thats thats uh yeah PM But then you cant Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah yeah au automac matically that it yeah ME Yeah UI After two minutes or three minutes something like that ME After two minutes yeah two three minutes yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ID And maybe a low battery indicator UI Yeah ID On the screen UI Sure ME Yeah ME And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty UI Yeah ME Then you have plenty of time to recharge it of put it in a recharger UI Mm ME Charger ID So we are going for the for the recharger UI Yeah ME Yeah if its ID Okay ME Uh PM If its sensible ME Yeah because when youre watching TV youre zapping and you have to put it in a recharger and I dont think it Yeah okay but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours six hours five six hours then PM Yeah PM Yeah b when the batteries are low But youll also forget to put it in because you throw it on the couch and you dont remember UI No when you when youre done with s uh w uh watching your television you have to put it Yeah sure of course ME Yeah then you have a problem UI Yeah but But you also forget to buy batteries and then you can you cant use it so I Yeah PM Yeah PM Thats right PM Yeah ME Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when theyre recharged ME So PM Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days or not ME Yeah because you have b but you have LCD screen PM Cause Yeah thats right but Yeah ME High power usage UI High power user cell i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when youre done watching television thats also a a a great advantage because you cant lose it anymore ME Yes UI Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions ME True ME Yeah ME Yeah ME True PM Right ME Yeah you made a point there UI Okay PM But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the TV ID Yeah also ME Yeah otherwise all your yeah ME Just a small device PM Yeah UI Yeah it hasnt It doesnt have to be big ME Plug it in thats it PM I think everything has it for and I guess ME Yeah like a like telephone charger or something UI Yeah just just a cable or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on ME Yeah ME Yeah UI Something like that just u Okay PM Yeah PM Alright ID Okay well Ive Yeah you have some more points ME It has to be easy to use also or things ME Uh market share speaker re speech recognition ME I think UI Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh or Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify ME Also ME Well I think that this should be standard ME Large button large buttons ME Yeah ME Okay UI Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen but the elderly only look at two buttons UI Okay ID And you said something about speech recognition ME Yeah it says also Yeah UI Speech recognition UI Hello UI Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty PM Yeah twelve fifty twelve fifty ME Twelve ME Thats an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five twenty six to thirty five years seventy six percent and thirty six to forty five thirty five percent PM So its pretty big UI Well spread it by a big market ME But then I I I Yeah ID Even bigger than for LCD PM Yeah PM W I know lets do a speech UI Well lets leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to Yeah Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah ME Ninety ME Twenty five PM You can clap or something ME channel UI Turn volume up PM Yeah UI Hey that thats an idea PM Now you shouldnt say the wrong thing I dunno ME Yeah UI Okay well that should it has to be remote control not Yeah ME Yeah twelve PM But they want to talk into the remo remote control or something or ME Yeah UI Sure why not why not Yeah mm ME Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ME Its the only thing it says PM Oh but do we want to implement that or ME I think an LCD screen should be suf sufficient UI Yeah ID But when you look at the percentages Speech recognition scores even higher huh ME Yeah it says a lot but No I think I think its better to have L LCD screen because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands and fifty five of those people want LCD screen and thirty five want speech recognition UI Perhaps the options should be uh Why not ID Yeah well maybe because of the cost but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh UI Why not PM Yeah UI Lets hope uh to have some uh d We should do it PM I know Mm ME So I think its better to keep it with LCD screen ID But would it be useful to imple implement both ME Yeah if the costs al allow it ID On one remote PM Well I dont know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty ID Or Yeah I dunno ME Nee PM With that uh Yeah but how would you like to implement that that you say volume up and then it goes up or ME If it should be done if it could be done I wont matter ME Yeah UI Yeah UI Sure UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Uh UI Certain systems already exist I think ME Mmhmm PM Then you also have to have different languages if we go international PM Then uh its y its yours to do a French and Dutch and English and Yeah thats right ME True UI True yeah ME Yeah ME True UI Yeah ME But that should also be with f should be also with LCD screen UI This should be uh accommodated with some software uh uh UI Yeah ME Because then I think in Chinese is different written volume is different written than um Swahili or something PM Yeah UI Right UI Swahili PM Yeah you can use icons for the a speaker and uh But if thats better than language for the for the remote UI Swahili UI Yeah ME Ja well possible UI Indeed ME Yeah yeah yeah yeah UI Yeah UI So we want to uh yeah its international uh okay PM Then its Yeah UI Okay ME Kay what else ID So no speech recognition ID Or Yeah and then we have different languages PM Well if it could be done we Yeah ME Yeah we have to keep Yeah UI Y it should be done UI If it could be done should be done PM Yeah that should be uh anything matters UI Thats not so difficult at all because I already use on several voice operated systems and they are all possible to uh not all but Yeah sure indeed ID Okay just make a separate remote for each uh Okay so we only do this when we have enough money left PM Well you sh you should to adjust the thing ME I think its difficult ME Every language of dialects I think its very differen difficult PM Yeah PM And you have to speak the so that it can understand ME Yeah ME I think it cant be implemented but maybe Yeah s an option yes PM You could use that n as an option if you have money left or something ME Fifty Euro cents PM Yeah PM Lets do speech ME Yeah UI For speech recognition PM Yeah ID Okay ID Well Ive written down an an on or off button volume selection channel selection uh the digits from one to zero huh ID Um or from zero to nine ID Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits mute button a separate menu for teletext a battery indicator ID Um were going to use a docking station and uh probably LCD and if theres enough money speech recognition PM Mm ID And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general ME Mm yes PM Yeah PM I With uh teletext if it wasnt ver very important it was but You also now have colours ME No but Curved PM I dont know if we should implement that PM Yeah when you press the red button you go to page one hundred two and when you press the I dont know if we should implement that because it says that teletext not really important but yeah the shortcut and you cant go to sport UI Uh yeah ME Um UI S Shortcuts UI Uh ME I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings screen settings and channel settings but as submenus PM Yeah UI Mm ME D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on you have to u you have to see from one till zero channel and volume ME And if you want to use teletext screen or audio then you can press it UI Sh Yeah just just submenu ME It should be available but not not Yeah UI Yeah PM Cause it should be there UI Not directly uh available ME Yeah UI Okay ID Okay so not too much teletext support but in a separate menu and Okay but no more buttons or functions or ME Yeah UI Mm PM So actually it is there but its just not r ready there ME Yeah but s Yeah UI Directly available UI So does it confuse uh the user PM Youll have to search for it ME Theyd have to be easy to use UI Uh UI Ill search um UI If you want to use teletext you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available PM Yeah PM Yeah thats a I guess not ME The sign of it ME Uh no UI No ME What else can you do with a television PM Weve got anon Have got got two examples here but I dont think theres anything were missing ID Arent we forgetting something very important ME Uh play pause doesnt n need to be there PM Well we dont have the video orders Yeah you could look here all the the Uh th th th th I dont know technical functions ME Yes so this is your presentation ME We could check the other remote controls with technical functions ME Which ones were yours ME Techni Ja ja ja ja ja PM Theyre a bit small you can we should stretch them because I guess weve got them all ID Ping ME Technical functions ME Yeah okay ME Uh I think I go to have volume mute but I Yeah ME Very slow ME Yeah the zoom buttons PM And for a TV ME Yeah b wide screen high screen different things you have yeah different uh Yeah PM Can you zoom in a TV PM Or that you can put em on uh on on wide and yeah PM But that should also be a sub then a sub uh menu thing UI Menu ME Yeah it should be available but then in separate screen settings or something PM Yeah so we should also implement se screen settings UI Mm ME Yeah screen settings audio settings teletext settings you have PM Oh right PM Yeah ME Channel settings PM Yeah so you can program the Yeah so the first you see the main and the other ones you can uh go to uh Yeah ME So those four and of course the main ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Like tap screens or something or I dunno PM I hope we can do this ME Something Yeah if uh No you dont yu a no you then you dont no ni dont then you dont use it UI There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got UI Cause if you dont got a wide screen television you dont need the uh the screen settings uh for uh Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations Yeah ME Mmhmm PM We dont have to use that top PM Yeah ME Yeah ME So you leave it alone UI Yeah ME Yeah ME Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote an expanded version PM Yeah PM And do we want them in different colours or And and the buttons should they have colours ME Yeah ME Colours ME Yeah UI Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the LCD screen PM Oh but we dont have any buttons PM Yeah UI I Because we dont want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g Okay so use uh very uh lot of peo Adjust with phones yes Okay ID Yeah ME Yeah then defines itself ME Because uh how many percent ME Eighty percent PM They think its ugly right ME Would spend more money if it looks fancy PM Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts like with the telephones PM You can uh But I dont think that uh Yeah UI Twelve Euro fifty UI Well make it available in different colours you mean UI Sure ME Yeah UI Red white blue black ME Rasta colours ID And a seethrough uh Okay well thats the signal for las final five minutes UI Grey UI Yeah sea view yes Simpsons versions and Leave PM Yeah ME Yeah see through version ME Yeah ME If you press a button it turns green PM Yeah PM A disco version PM Five minutes ID Um so I have uh the things I just read ID Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext screen settings audio settings and what else UI Yeah ME Channel settings PM Oh yeah right ID Channel settings PM So you can program the TV ME Yeah ID Okay ME Mm PM Perhaps you should youd throw them on on in one pile PM So options and then you sub them ME Yeah PM Otherwise you have all those teletext perhaps teletext not but Yeah but I Yeah ME Could be possible UI Mm ME Or like uh you have a menu button you press Yeah or otherwise you have a menu button press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings ID No we said teletext also a separate menu PM Yeah ID Okay but we can work that out later I guess PM But I dont know ME Yeah no problem ID So were having a a general menu with the most used functions uh teletext screen settings audio settings channel settings and maybe there are options for the remote itself ME Yep ID Like uh large icons or small icons and I dont know what else but Yeah but on the LCD huh ME Um I think b because we dont have a lot of buttons on the one screen I think the buttons Yeah but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button UI No PM Or do we have any buttons PM On the remote PM Which one ME Those buttons you can you can Yeah PM But thats also in the LCD right ID Right yeah okay ME Yeah th No no normal buttons yeah PM So we dont have any normal buttons that uh No alright ME Maybe only the on and o on and off button PM Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno No no ID But we dont need a special we dont need a special options menu for the remote itself UI Uh not button Yeah sure of course you need uh a settings button uh or a settings option for the remote control ME But I dont think Mm no ID Okay PM Oh well you should be able to set which TV you have PM If you have if you have uh Yeah PM But isnt idea to use uh uh what you said uh normal on and off button for the TV that you dont have to use a Yeah but but not for the remote but for the TV that you use But a not as normal button in the LCD yeah ME No no no because we we discussed that you could charge it otherwise is it it jumps to standby mode automatically ME Yeah but a TV of course th thats the I think thats a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel ME No ID Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD because you cant turn it on when the LCD is off ID So how do you turn the thing on ID There has to be a on button on the remote huh PM No you just tap I think ME Yeah you tap UI Just tap it ME Touch screen yeah then its turn turn off turn on ID Tap the thing ID Okay ID And then the television is on also or just the remote ME No just the remote ME A television dont have to be on that one you can press on yeah standby then press on remote press on and then TV should be available ID Sure PM But Yeah a yeah UI Yeah it should be in standby mode but A A A normal button on the remote control or norm ME Or not PM I dont know whether its handy to have a n a normal on button a r just uh rubber uh for for TV so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel ME Separate PM Otherwise you I dont know whether or not thats Yeah yeah PM To turn it on PM Of or you should put it in the LCD screen UI Yeah because uh when you touch the LCD screen when it is in standby mode it should pop on PM Yeah I have yeah ID Okay well Yeah UI Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button PM Well I I guess if you use the LCD screen you first have to search where is the on button then you uh you you then turn it and then the TV goes on PM But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote then you do the on and then you search the channel which you want ME Yeah but I think the re the remote control if you press tap the screen it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button channel button and of course of also the on and off button UI Mm PM Oh right UI I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you dont have any buttons on the s on on remote control PM Yeah I think so too PM Otherwise y wet e k Yeah ME Yeah ID So actually were going to create a a buttonless uh remote PM Yeah ID No buttons at all ID Okay well thats might be a unique selling point huh for a remote ME Mmhmm PM If we can afford it ID Okay well I guess we have to postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting because were running out of time ME Yeah if we can afford it ME Yeah UI Oh okay Oh ID Um for now were having a lunch break and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work ID I will uh write uh minutes if I can create them out of this ID And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder UI Mm ID And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles ID And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach PM Alright ID Luckily as we are ID Okay well thank you very much for now and uh have a nice lunch huh ME Mmhmm PM Lunch UI Okay UI Food PM Should we put this back in our rooms or uh UI Yeah think so PM Yeah,"The project manager opened the meeting and then the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote along with his personal preferences for the appearance of a remote. The user interface designer discussed the technical functions of a remote and indicated that a user centered approach to designing the interface would be preferable. The marketing expert discussed the functional requirements of a remote and user tendencies in using remotes. The marketing expert indicated that an ideal remote would include an LCD screen, would not be too small in size, and is easy to use. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the appearance and functions of their upcoming product."
ID Okay welcome everyone to our next meeting ID Im busy writing and busy leading the meeting but um Ive prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side ID Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting which is hereby opened ID Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder which was quite some typing ID Um today we once again have uh three presentations if Im right and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts ID And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that ID Okay well Id say lets start with the first presentation ME Kay ID Um in the same order as last time UI W sure PM Mm ID Okay PM Alright ID Well take it away UI Okay uh welcome you all UI Components design um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did UI I I elaborated on the concept UI What should be um uh said about uh the components uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls UI Uh well first of all Ive uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote controls formed UI Uh first of all the case the case the surrounding of the of the the remote control UI I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about ME Dont destroy my giraffe UI Giraffes gone now UI Okay um the case was is made from rubber I suppose UI Theres one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option ME Drop it PM Hmm UI But uh its a very expensive material UI Uh rubber is I think uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control UI Um its poss its also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber UI Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour UI Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh its possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly UI Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber thats sor uh thats thats used uh to make the case is uh the same colour so if you scratch it its still the same colour perhaps uh its a little bit damaged UI But its a very strong material UI Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved sorry single curved UI Uh so its t two dimensional UI I think its uh its best to draw oh green PM Its a colour ME Bright colour UI Uh New ME Fancy colour ME Forward UI Blank UI Okay ME You have to go t Oh its a side view UI Lets make it uh black UI Okay UI I thought of an idea like this UI Oh that UI Um delete UI Blank UI Okay UI So it also looks nice when its on your table UI So you get uh it doesnt lay flat down on the table but its c its stands UI Side view yes its side view so uh I Im not technically good at th three D modelling but UI Um uh its just an idea I had so its uh its very uh so its also looks nice when its on the table UI Um the graphical user interface and the buttons uh we also thought about that already UI Uh I thought about uh the LCD touch screen which is uh is easy to clean too UI One of the great uh advantages of the LCD screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff UI And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright UI Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component ME True UI So uh uh thats all about uh the buttons UI Uh the batteries uh we also thought about that already uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that UI Questions ME No no no no no PM No UI Okay ME Just looking UI And they should be long lasting not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use UI And next step is the chip uh th the component thats uh makes or transmits the signal to the television UI Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side UI Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours UI That was correct wasnt it ID Mmhmm UI Okay UI I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber ID Well business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image so yeah it needs colour but I dont think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour UI Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind wasnt it UI Okay so it d it doesnt says uh to uh have the slogan ID It must be recognisable UI Okay okay UI Well thats possible of course UI We could make a little R and R on the top of the machine PM You can put the R and R UI Uh so they are pretty boring I suggest because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours so its possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find theyre uh interesting UI And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours UI Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that but i if you drop it its not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic hard plastic or uh titanium UI And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control because it yeah it makes sense UI Okay UI Well thats all about my uh my findings PM Alright ID Okay thank you ME Mm mm mm PM I will go next ME Next PM Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface PM Uh how it should look PM And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons but only an LCD screen so I had to uh look on that PM And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of PM Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition PM And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you PM And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker PM And so that it you say uh good morning uh coffee maker and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or whats your name UI Mm PM This uh and theres an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer UI Mm PM Um perhaps its useful perhaps for because people um lose the remote they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something ID Mm UI Mm ME Its true PM And perhaps we could uh implement that PM And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I cant draw so uh dont make too much of it UI Oh my God PM I tried to uh the LCD screen I tried to sort of to draw PM I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume PM I dont know if there is an icon for the program but yeah UI Not just a P ME P yeah just a P UI Oh okay PM So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon UI PM Um ME Wheres wheres the button for two PM I forgot that one ME Okay PM I thought I forgot something but uh PM And uh and uh the numbers that should be a bit larger I think its not really on scale and and so forth UI Ah ME Doesnt matter PM Um an options button PM And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because its not really options I think UI Mmhmm PM Its uh options is the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of uh thing ME No UI Yep PM So could call it settings or something PM But this is a bit uh how I thought it PM And uh the LCD uh somewhere on the remote PM Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should so that its better in your hand or something uh UI Oh okay yeah PM But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that PM Uh and then uh if you press the op options button now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this UI Oh yeah PM And uh its also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people dont really want to use uh these extra settings PM And older people a also dont really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus PM So they want to u use one button and then something happens and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things ID Mmhmm UI Mm UI Okay PM Thats an option PM And that was my uh finding dinge ID Thanks PM Yeah ME Okay ID Now our third team member with his presentation UI Go Danny go Danny ME Okay Im going to tell you something about a trend watching ME The trends from the past years what the people like what the youngsters like what the elderly people liked about shapes colours material and stuff ME Kay ME The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours shapes material they wanted uh from elderly and young people ME So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself ME Findings I made ME The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy ME The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative okay like the LCD screen thats quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this ME And the third thing is it should be easy to use ME I think with only one menu four button channel volume it should also be enough for easy to use ME The personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow uh strawberry red and stuff UI Fruity UI Fruity PM Grass green ME Yeah ME Like that ME The round shapes and soft material m materials like the rubber UI Mm ME It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things UI Okay PM Lets build it into a sponge ME Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown red deep reds and stuff ME They liked square shapes with round edges ME And hard materials like wood um titanium ME They those kind of materials they liked ME This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours innovative all the colours you see the blue the red the white the yellow that stuff ME And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something ID Oh y So for the older people a more traditional uh form ME Its its a bit like a banana ME And the colour should be yellow or something ME And for the elderly people just plain old ME Because we decided to have two kind of remotes two designs or was it two colours PM It was one remote I think different colours ME Different colours yeah ME We should decide whether its going to be with round shapes ME I think like my colleague you said is thats e better or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something with round squares ME Simple but easy to use UI Mm ME So thats it UI Okay ME That is my Yeah like the older o older colours I can maybe Yeah PM You could you could uh change the colours that was also the idea PM I dont know which shape you should should take but ME Colours th the elderly people Uh Look something like that ID Yeah I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh the shape of it PM Yeah UI Changing just the shape of the uh remote control PM Perhaps you could find something in the middle UI Yeah s round corners but s but square yeah PM Round but square PM Yeah ID But maybe then both groups wont buy it UI Yeah PM Uh i i if you do it uh uh square with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean UI Yeah I know what you mean kind of like a PM wait like like this uh a bit UI Yeah PM So its a bit square but its also a bit uh round UI Kinda like a beer glass PM So but then Same sides UI Yeah UI I know what you mean UI Its also easy to to have to to put in your hand PM But thats uh Yeah but thats also how other remotes are shaped so thats uh But perhaps thats a good thing so thats easy to use UI Yeah PM People know the Yeah UI Will recognise thats as a remote control UI Uh when I saw your d Oh ME Autumn colours like red brown ME They liked the wood a lot UI Huh ID Mmhmm ME So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour PM Yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah kinda like old cars uh Lets put it all together ME And a bit bit old school style renaissance medieval kind of things PM Yeah PM Swords ME Those kind of Yeah those kind of things ME So you see the big difference between the young people ME Fresh exciting PM Yeah ME And the old people old and boring PM But thats easily to do with the colour I think ME So Sorry PM Thats easy to do with the colours I think ME Yeah I think its its easier to do in colour than in shape PM Yeah UI Uh ME Because otherwise we have to get different shapes and colour way easier than yeah the shapes ID Yeah we think so too ME In material yeah rubber rubber is like I said young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood PM Yeah UI Yeah ME So we have to decide if were going to use real hard rubber or soft rubber PM Yeah think uh Also in between ME Or something something between that UI Soft rubber ME Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it UI Yeah I know what you Um PM I dont think you should be able to mould it but Yeah ME Or No ME Or or wh whats something harder UI It should shouldnt be ME No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something ME Thats the bit you can press it in or something harder UI Uh PM Bit like this kind of rubber PM This uh But its quite hard this ME Yeah something like this yeah ME Yeah its quite hard but you can press it in PM Yeah ME Its feels kind s spongy UI Spongy ID Hmm ME Something PM I dont think its rubber ME No ME N n n Are you going to invite Sponge Bob maybe he can Yeah I think thats the better thing to do ID So we need a spongy feeling PM Uh did you have something about uh So we should first decide about shape I think UI Yeah UI Ding ding PM Which uh Then you can fit the LCD screen in it and can decide uh UI Um I also s uh cant help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the LCD screen was uh rather small ME Yeah w I think that LCD screen should be like Yeah three quarter of the of the Yeah the buttons wont get that small when the LCD screen is Mmhmm UI Um PM Yeah it its supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah UI UI This was your size but I think it should be larger UI Yeah three quarters UI So uh so you dont have to put your oh UI Uh new blank UI So uh when you get this uh Uh kinda like this PM Ooh Yeah UI Or should it be larger ME Larger I think UI Larger UI Because you want to put your hands You want Yeah PM But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you wont touch the screen ME Yeah becau because you have Yeah okay true true true true PM Perhaps thats best UI Your thumb here PM But not on the screen because Yeah thats uh thats an idea UI Yeah ME Yeah PM Looks a bit like a Game Boy now UI Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself uh youll youll always get some You Yeah PM You always touch it yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah yeah UI Going to be very greasy and stuff ME But it wont get that small because you have how much ME Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen PM Yeah ME One to zero the two digit You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time UI Yeah you dont want it too small UI How yeah how large Yeah they have thick fingers UI But if you wanna make it in international Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands and we got these large Zoom opt Ah yeah of course yeah ME Yeah true but Yeah we have we have the zoom option right UI You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button ME Yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah ID And we wont include a a pen or something to point hey we we want to do it with our fingers right ME No ME Yeah UI Your fingers yeah ME Yeah UI You dont want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you cant use Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth ID Yeah PM Y you could include a pen ME Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen ID Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th theyre used to that and And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers huh ME Yeah the fingers yeah PM Yeah o yeah if they think its handy to use a pen PM Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen PM I dont know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this or something PM Yeah ME Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue ME Yeah you can buy those at Maybe its better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station ID Okay well maybe if I can interrupt you maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision UI Sure ID So we can discuss these points ID those points um energy question mark ID How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it ID Uh chip on print and case ID Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here but I hope you have ideas about them PM I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah UI The docking station ID Yeah ID So thats the the the first point ID We already decided that on the previous meeting UI W Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah ME So if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them ID Mmhmm PM Just like with the telephone UI I kinda like your Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ME Yeah yeah yeah like those UI Mouse UI Computer mouse UI Kinda like those kind of batteries ME Yep PM but it should be th I think normal batteries not not like two or two uh Yeah ME Yeah normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop UI Yeah ID Simple rechargeable uh batteries ME Yeah PM Yeah PM Um what was with the chip on print UI The chip on print UI Um Uh you gotta f Yeah UI I think so UI Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a We also discussed that ME Print plate UI Didnt we ID Yeah but how did this how does that with a LCD screen ID You still have a print plate UI Uh Beg your pardon ME Yeah yeah yeah ME You always have a print plate ME You always have a print plate right UI Yeah sure of course yeah ID Mmhmm ME Always so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that ID Yeah well its a good question ID It just was in there and I didnt have any information about it but Mmhmm UI Well uh chip on print I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got uh its always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button UI But when you got a LCD screen with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place for example if you enlarge a button or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen uh the coordinations arent always the same ME Yeah okay ME But Yeah okay but the p print plate of L LCD screen is more advanced than a normal print plate so that thats not of any discussion I think PM Yeah UI When you got a regular button th the button of standby is always on the same place and you got on the and on the Yeah ID Well you need some kind of CPU I guess UI I suppose so ME Mm I dont I dunno I dont think thats Yeah yeah okay but I d I I dont know if nor o s its quite a simple LCD UI It is a simple CPU but it doesnt Yeah because it has to uh b Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether youre in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume ME Yeah its quite a simple LCD screen ME I think they dont need that big of CPU ME Yeah okay true true ME True UI So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or CPU to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment ID Mmhmm ID Because were projecting projecting the buttons on the LCD screen UI Yeah UI And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the coordination of your finger on the screen ID Yeah UI And the case yeah we already discussed the case we wanted to make it from rubber and uh Uh hard rubber I think PM Its rubber PM Yeah but but a hard rubber like this PM Or softer rubber or Yeah UI Thats the easy to ha uh to to uh Yeah ME Yeah PM It bounces back from the floor where you throw it UI Yeah sure look ME We have different colours PM Yeah yeah this in different colours ME So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes UI D Its our main target ME No I dont think I think its more round than square PM Yeah its a bit PM But I think it should be a bit longer perhaps ME So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people PM Yeah ID Yeah ID But thats what we want PM I think so too ME Yeah thats our target ME Yeah PM Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Lower than forty years I think it was UI Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ME Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good Yeah UI So i Because its a gadget and you want to show it off of course PM Yeah ID Yeah yeah you have a fancy design then right away PM Yeah UI Uh ME You can put it on your table with the LCD screen you dont have to put it get it in your hand you can put it next to you and then dive it in and ID So Okay so Yeah but I wrote it down UI Because it Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah thats a good idea UI Its a lot easier ME Yeah PM Yeah alright ME So You cant you You cant oh you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the And load it on the the user the server UI So so you got uh Did you write that down PM And then Yeah you can uh Its pretty easy but And Yeah I had what I just uh I should again UI Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured remote control UI Yeah ID What about the user interface there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that ID You you showed your drawing PM I miss a few buttons but PM Well PM At least uh what we should also have on I just remembered um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options you cant go back to this uh right away now ME Mmhmm ME Yeah you have to go back ME Yeah uh uh PM This I dont know ME Isnt it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ME With the minus and the plus PM I think its I dont know ME I think its easier than Yeah PM I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way but I dont know what they think UI Sorry PM Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ID Mm ME For sound and channel UI Depends on the screen PM Th Right well if we make it like this I think if you put it like this Yeah UI If you make the screen vertical it doesnt matter UI If you make it uh in a rectangle I so its its its its Square ME Yeah ME I think its its easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here plus over here ME A minus here plus over here UI Oh okay ME And on here ME The other buttons and on here the top ME The options and then you have something like uh the P over here and the sound PM Yeah PM But I think I wou I think thats a matter of what youre used to ME Something uh Something like Sh Plus minus plus uh minus PM I think I would put a plus and a min uh here PM And then the P in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle UI Uh UI Take your time PM Almost PM Yeah but I think when you are holding it you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus ME Yeah I think youre going to s youre going to use it with one thumb PM Yeah but I think Yeah I dont know PM Perhaps I have some examples UI W Well leave that to the usability engineering then PM I dont know Thats me ME Whos the usability engineering ME She is PM But Im going to look if Ive got some examples cause perhaps you should choose whats most often used ME Oh PM The Cause they can use that better UI Yeah ME Um Oh I have that those s numbers UI Consistency PM Yeah PM I Here is our here are uh I dont really know ME Or a good watch ME B Channel selection ID Everybodys searching in his data PM Yeah ME Per hour one hundred and sixty eight ME Volume selection four times an hour Uh Yeah that depends on on on the remote PM Yeah but But I mean if its usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote UI Yeah UI So not how much n not how often its used but Uh PM W whats whats usual or normal PM Yes Im looking here PM But heres its below here also and now heres heres next to each other PM I think its its a Yeah ME I think because I have two televisions at home ME One is horizontal one is vertical so it depends UI Yeah it does it doesnt really matter but Uh ME Yeah ME Depends PM I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other because you go higher and down ME Yeah lower PM And the the pay the the the program is next to each other because you would go further and back ME True PM Thats how its is usually when I look here thats what I see UI Okay um UI Lets cut to the chase ME Its got to change ID Yeah well I think we have we dont have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts PM I dont know ME Yeah is it is user interface PM Yeah ME Component PM This concept is in the actual design but you should know where you would place a And the speech uh shall we implement that UI Okay well le Yeah UI Interface yeah PM Or uh Yeah ID Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology huh ME Yeah I think its its easy for that where are you but then it says Im here UI Technologies uh UI Yeah UI Makes it possible to Mm PM But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something ME Yeah PM You can talk into the corner ME Yeah a microphone yeah PM Yeah UI Not even necessary because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote ID Mmhmm PM Yeah ID Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that theres also a microphone uh over there PM But Yeah thats also UI Yeah UI Right PM So in the middle or something UI But thats not import I think thats not im very important because yeah it doesnt matter where the microphone is ID Yeah yeah PM but you should uh decide where you want to put it UI Ah okay sure okay well tha Underneath PM Right ME Um I think where it isnt seen the most UI Indeed UI It shouldnt be uh very uh visible ME Inside PM You could p you could put it in a logo of the company ID Yeah UI Yeah sure why no Yeah but it doesnt makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh Uh ME Yeah ID Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote huh the the speech control ME I i between the round of the R PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah okay PM So where do you want to put it ID Well maybe where the one hand But are we talking about the button or about the microphone PM Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it ME Yeah ME Yeah bu but I think the left s under corner should be the best PM Its a way for you to uh So it makes more sense just cause other remotes dont have that UI Yeah okay PM About a microphone there is no button ID Yeah because a microphone is very small thing but you can make it look like its big so as its its really an important function of the remote PM Yeah ME Where isnt i it isnt most in sight PM Yeah UI Okay ME I think UI Well put it there UI I dont mind UI That doesnt doesnt really matter ME No ME Actually doesnt UI Okay PM Alright UI So PM Any more uh Yeah ID So well uh type supplements anything UI Interface type ID Yeah well we already s discussed that huh the the LCD and Mmhmm UI The LCD yeah uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah ME I think I thought the like you said like scroll next to the remote isnt that handy PM Yeah ME I think its better to just up what youd like to do on the screen ME If you want to go back you have to back button go back if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s submenu PM Yeah UI Hey PM Um yeah PM Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah UI Use the scroll ME Yeah UI Yeah I think so too ME You do like it UI So why not on on side PM Or at least Yeah I dont know if its really the scroll but the menu they like most and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh But you have its f uh we have five or four or something UI Fast yeah ME Yeah I think it is is faster UI So if youve got a settings if you Yes ME Becau I think the scrolls easier if you have a lot of options but if you dont have a lot of option then Y Uhhuh UI You have a lot of options because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen ME Yeah okay true PM Yeah UI So then its uh very handy to to scroll down you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or ME Okay UI Just put it on the side and its very easy to use ME Okay no problem ID And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and Yeah UI Yeah yeah PM Yeah PM Its also different UI Yeah ME Okay ID Okay ID Well theres our five minutes uh warning ID Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components everyone ME Um ME No colours are clear shape is clear material is clear ID Everybody think they can can work for that UI Okay whats the standard colour ME And a standard yeah we dont no we have different colour ID Is there a standard colour UI I I You got you got different colours but you should have a standard colour ME How many colours are we going to Black PM You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard ME Yeah black I think is is the standard UI Black UI With the with the yellow uh Just a regular uh remote colour PM But if you want to be different then uh Silver ME Dark grey something like this this colour or something ME Yeah like like yeah UI And then have uh different covers uh to use ME Or or silver ME I think its better to have silver nowadays UI Silver yeah ME I think you see more silver than black ID Yeah UI You see a lot of t uh silver televisions ID But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional so uh Yeah w what about a yellow thing I mean it could be ugly but its definitely fancy PM Silver rubber ME Yeah the the silver black are our main colours ME Yeah ME I think we have silver black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something UI Yeah y I think its better to Yeah th yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah itll be a banana yellow we have ME R red PM But yeah UI Thats right ME Green wood brown UI But if you use uh silver uh rubber s silver rubber isnt fancy ME Yeah ME True UI When you use titanium silver is fancy but when you use silver rubber it isnt fancy PM Yeah UI Silver has to shine and rubber doesnt shine ID Mmhmm UI Especially when its made of soft rubber like this PM Yeah UI You understand ME Yeah I understand ID Yeah I would think about colours like uh red yellow green blue just Yeah ME Yeah o of course UI Yeah ME The fruity colours and the autumn colours like red and brown dark red and brown UI Fruity PM Just all kind of colour UI Fruity loops ID Mmhmm ID Maroon PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Okay ID Okay so Whos pinging PM And and do we have to have a normal black one or uh Is it Yeah ME No ID You are pingin Okay UI You ping ID I thought we Okay so uh that wraps it up ID Everybody knows uh what to do ID Well I wrote it down here UI Well not what to do PM Well I dont know what to do but ID I wrote it down here what to do um UI Not what to do UI Look ID The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes UI Okay ID Um here are the individual actions and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach PM Ooh PM Right ME S tough PM Yeah ME Well be available PM But do we have to Well work together but do we have to stay here or do we Right ID Well I Id say just wait uh for email and uh find out PM Yes ID I dont know PM Okay UI Thin I think we should work ID Okay well that was what I had to say uh final thoughts from anyone or PM Yeah I think PM No ME No ID Were finished ID Okay well thank you very much PM Yeah ME Finished UI Thank you very much PM So we have to keep talking English now,"After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip. The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people. The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people. The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions. The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface."
ID Good UI Beep UI Oh PM What ID So well uh welcome everyone PM Yeah ID Um as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder PM Yeah ID I dont know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder which is for now the detailed design meeting ME Thats new one PM We didnt make any uh Oh in Didnt we just do that ID Yeah UI Uh we should save that one ID Then Ill move this one UI Yeah save in the folder PM Oh UI Save as project ID Oh no this is just one big document so you can leave that wherever it is UI Oh okay UI Hmm hmm ID And we have a evaluation left here ID Okay UI Agenda ID Well not main documents this time PM Hmm ID Oh uh yes ID I have it open myself I guess ID Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ID Were finally getting somewhere hopefully ID Um what are we going to do ID Ive opened it already ID Um Im still going to take some minutes and if Im right you two are going to give a prototype presentation UI Oh sorry PM We could ID Arent you ID Yes you are ID And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ME Yep ME Yep ID Good ID And we have a correct agenda ID And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice the finance uh aspect whether we can afford what we have designed and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation how did we work together and what are the results and how happy are we with those PM Oops ID Okay well finance uh will be later ID Now Id like to give the word to you two PM Yeah UI Okay UI Get up stand up PM Well uh we made a prototype UI just Kay PM We first start with the overall uh This is about the total remote control UI View PM We made it green UI Just example colour so uh theres one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype PM Yeah PM Its a fresh colour PM And uh the screen light blue PM Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under PM And the R and R logo it just says R and R now but uh Any questions so far UI Okay ME Big microphone UI yeah just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible PM Yeah ME Oh okay ME Thats the place where its going to be not the size UI Uh well its an idea in a so PM Yeah PM Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know its there and uh Uh Hmm UI Do not forget it ME Mmhmm UI To function it it doesnt really have to be sm uh big of course ME Yeah okay UI The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button ME Of course ME Mm ME Mm th yeah ME Small UI Okay um we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work UI Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um Yeah you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available PM You push the scroll button and its claps out if theres a Remote settings et cetera UI For example uh TV settings uh remote settings et cetera PM Yeah UI So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button uh as you can see oh its here just push it in uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible PM Yeah UI Um Yeah thats c Yeah PM And you could also touch it so that it comes out and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers UI Indeed PM Yes UI Okay um its also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button and the opportunity to use the teletext whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that its uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu but in uh Yes UI In an apart uh In a separate button yeah PM Yeah ID So a separate button for for text okay PM Yeah PM Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah UI A sign yeah just like Okay indeed PM Yeah UI Okay we can uh modify that later PM Forgot UI Okay UI Would you like to make any comments about next uh Previous page yeah indeed PM Uh well this is the total interface uh that f of the LCD screen PM Uh the numbers which is pretty straight forward PM We put ano an an extra button in PM We can erase it but Its the button where you can switch channels PM just when you are one and you go to two you can or if you go to five you can go back to one with that button PM Yeah that one yeah PM It has a name PM And uh uh we put that in I thought it would be handy there UI Oh my God PM Uh this the one number or two numbers button PM Below that the page and the sound PM And uh in the middle the the mute PM Uh battery indicator PM Its its a bit big UI Its quite large PM And this is the uh the on off uh knop the stand by uh knop PM Or at least it should look like it PM And the options uh of teletext UI Okay UI You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isnt uh taking uh much uh uh its taking much part of the screen so its very uh when you uh when you use it doesnt uh become irritating to see UI Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu PM Huh UI Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down so Okay ID Mmhmm PM Yeah PM Well this about it I think PM Yeah UI Huh ID Thank you PM I will put it back on the on the nice green ID Looks good ID And I just missed when I was typing The RR stands for PM Thats the logo of the Yeah ID Logo okay PM Its th th right now its only R R but uh Yeah ID Okay well I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course UI Full screen ME Shit UI Alright PM Sorry ME Kay ID Okay the evaluation criteria huh PM Oh full screen yeah UI Huh ME Evaluation ME Kay my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users ME My name my job okay UI My name my job ME The methods ME Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven from true to false like question is remote big enough we can say its true or its false by steps PM Right ME One means absolutely not true seven means true PM Yeah ME The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are is the remote control fancy enough is it in innovative enough and is it easy enough to use UI Sorry you used the PowerPoint What PM Yeah ME And then evaluation itself ME Uh ME So UI Bling ME Okay PM Yeah ME First question ME Is the design fancy enough PM Well Yeah ME Project Manager what do you think ID Well its looks fancy especially with the green colour ME But does it Yeah ID And the the curves which we decided huh ID Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting UI Now uh the single curved idea was uh Yeah okay you ge um Yeah PM It uh oh its in the background PM Oh PM Y you should make uh a sideways uh view UI The sideways view uh that that that ma Ho not that pen PM It will be I guess PM Oh we can Oh g I would smart board UI Not that pen ID Well it might work one time huh PM Uh can I draw here or uh Ooh UI Suppose so ME Think UI Ah ME Yeah yeah you can UI Oh my God it works PM So it would be uh something like this from the side but with a bit of uh curve here right UI Yeah thats the single curve indeed PM Yeah PM So if you v flip it like this UI Yep ID Okay PM Heres yeah UI Thats not very i its also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom UI Uh make it uh rather thick on the top because uh on the top it has uh the screen which takes uh in some uh space and the batteries can be located over there so uh Yeah PM Yeah PM So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it lays a bit o Yeah thats a bit of problem maybe ME Isnt going to be a little bit heavy at the top UI No ME With two batteries the whole print plate and t and top and if youre holding it quite a lot I think Yeah PM Yeah PM I think yeah the battery should be in here because its just nothing so if you could Yeah UI Yeah UI Okay indeed UI Yeah PM Cause otherwise I think i I think it does ID Okay but we have to rate uh these things now ME Yeah we have to rate ME Is it fancy enough ID Okay ME True is one false is seven ME So fancy enough means does it comes to the younger people and the elder people UI I think so ME I think Yeah I have to agree all the colour colours don don doesnt matter that m that much now its only design PM I if you dont make it green then the elder people wont wont like it UI Its pretty fancy PM Yeah UI you get th Yeah ID Mmhmm PM I think it does ID Yeah ME And the design ID Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the LCD screen also PM Yeah PM I dont know whether older people will use it but I would make it a two or something ID Very new thing ID Well Fancy the old people will ME So A two PM Yeah PM Huh UI Its true its a one PM Alright its a one UI Very fancy PM Oh its a one ID No its a two ID Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves huh ME Yeah I n used I wouldn I should use that one but it doesnt Okay no its two PM Yeah PM But its a one uh Maybe uh Yeah ME True is a one ME Very true is it very true or isnt that true ID Well Id say two on a scale No okay well thats true PM Well they think its very true but uh Yeah but We should perhaps That not UI Its very true because we designed it to be very fancy so Its very fancy I think ME Yeah I think two UI Have you ever seen a remote control like this UI No okay so so its fancy ME Thats fancy enough PM Yeah ME Then ID Okay one two ID That doesnt matter that much so make it a one ME Okay UI Yeah ME Lets give it a two ME Is it innovative PM I think it is because it has an LCD screen a mi microphone ME Enough ID Yeah m Yeah and you use these buttons the most huh UI And uh uh the scroll is rubber so s Eno enough to I think ME We have for the search function PM Its from rubber PM Yeah ME The scroller a bit I think its its a one yeah PM Its a one I think ME True ME Also huh uhhuh the buttons are they easy to find ME That was a big requirement of the old people PM Yeah because theyre right on your screen PM So you can use the b the the arrows UI Huh PM Theyre right on your screen so I dont know where youd search UI With the ones Yeah ME Are all the buttons easy to find PM Yeah ME Not only this buttons all the buttons PM Well I think they are PM The options are it uh little bit harder but if you touch the options then its uh No theyre not but theyre theyre they are easy to find UI Take a harder look yeah sure ME I think th its easy t Yeah I think this is easy now UI Its easier than the regular uh remote control ME I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle UI Yeah ID So So which So which number are we going to fill in ME True ME I would rate it a Yeah okay thats true thats true UI Yeah they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button PM Oh PM Yeah UI So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah ME But thats thats vantage of LCD screen you can have text PM I would say yeah UI I think its uh its a two at least PM Yeah PM Yeah you can make it a two ID A two yeah ID Two three and what do you think ME Yeah UI Its not perfect but A three ME I think its a three ID Okay so we have two two three UI And why is that ME I personally think because I d I dont think i maybe its easy to use it has to be easy to find right away ME I I think if you have the button at the right I dont think you can find the option button that easy PM Yeah but you dont have t have to use the button on the right ME You can touch it PM You can touch it PM Yeah UI It said bo both the options PM You you can touch options ME Yeah okay but you have y then you have here s written option on here the teletext button right PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Okay then okay good ME Then I think also two yeah PM You can touch options and its comes out ID A two okay because we have to Its the box below it huh ME Yep UI A two a two PM The uh the um Below UI Uh the next question the next question UI Oh my God ID Otherwise we have two results in one question PM Its different ID Okay next question ME Its easy to use as well for younger as elderl elderly people PM For young people I think its easy to use ME Young means sixteen to forty years UI Yeah I was uh Yeah PM Yeah ME And elderly from forty eight to their death PM I think its In the entire mankind UI I think its the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured ID Okay youre very enthusiastic about your own design huh ME Also if youre sixty years old Also Yeah as well as your if youre fif sixty years old youre holding one of those things in your hand No but were going to th make this f for a all kind of people so it it it has to be If you read the manual always UI Yeah but because it has the regular uh controls li uh as you can see in the screen now and uh you dont have all the other options uh always uh on your screen UI So its t I think its really easy to use PM Yeah UI You want these options to Uh sure ID As well for the for the older people PM Yeah but uh Yeah but they they dont want the uh extra options right PM So Yeah okay but so they could Uh I think it is ID And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition PM If they read a manual ID Because that might Yeah ID Okay well M maybe thats the most user friendly and easy to use UI Perhaps that is one of the most uh Uh because a lot of Channel one channel four yeah PM Yeah alright PM Because it its not its not its its not uh difficult PM You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition then you say the question and the answer PM And thats everything it does the speech recognition ID Yeah well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them PM Yeah PM I think it would make it uh I would make it two UI Yeah I think it does ME So Also two UI Because all the people who cant uh Uh a two PM Yeah ME Not a seven for this UI Sure two UI Oh ID Id say three PM Three ME I would also say three PM Oh ID Okay so we have three three two two or So what are we going to do PM You UI Two PM Oh PM Well Two and a half ID Okay a three I see ID Uh Another question PM Three UI Give me more PM No ME Remotes overwhelmed with buttons PM No UI No ID No ME No that thats thats yeah PM But um I mean thats definitely one ME Tha thats a one I think thats definitely a one UI Thats definitely our uh A false yeah PM Oh nee oh seven is it PM It is ME No ME Oh yeah PM Yeah uh the remote score ID Yeah ID Yeah but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad because otherwise we cant uh calculate anything from the results so Okay a one because we designed for that huh ME Yeah I think isnt this has to be something like isnt overwhelmed PM Its not overwhelmed PM Yeah UI Yeah indeed ME True PM Yep ME Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups PM Yes PM Cause we make them in different colours so that they uh Yeah ME Yeah UI Yeah is optional ID Yeah ME Thats true ID Yeah and I though w we had about single colours but you can also make uh a wood colour not just one single colour but a woodlike thing cant you UI Huh PM That it that it looks like wood like something yeah ME Also with rubber PM Uh I think you can ID Whether it looks like wood it isnt w it isnt wood but You can make a print on rubber cant you ME Yeah okay PM It it feels like rubber but Well but then when you scratch it it does come off UI Yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah ID So thats a one then huh ME Thats a one ME Okay UI Yeah it is it is harder to to like Geez PM So thats a bit Oh we have time ID Do you have many questions ME Uh I have The material used is spongy that thats uh thats a one thats m rubber ID Oh okay well Yeah but we have We also We have to get to the money UI Were getting paid UI Were getting paid PM What ID What spongy PM Yeah yeah its very spongy UI Uh ME Yeah I th think its not the most spongy thing PM Oh but not its not very spongy because its hard rubber PM I think its a three UI Yeah its a three because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible because it has a LCD screen ME Yeah ID Uhhuh yeah PM Hard but Yeah PM You can break it PM Yeah ME Remote control is hard to lose UI Hard to lose yeah it sh and its easy to find PM Y yeah you could you could call it ME Y you cant you cant lose it if youre sixty years old ME If first time see the thing you didn didnt adjust uh set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it PM Yeah y you can lose it but it isnt hard to lose ME It isnt hard no ME I think I think this is a two personally PM Two PM That its hard to lose ME No PM Yeah it it is theres the its a six you think UI Isnt hard to lose ID Yeah so isnt hard to lose you UI Isnt hard to lose yeah ME Isnt hard to lose PM So its a two PM Yeah you can lose it so I dont you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function ME Yeah ME You cant lose it ME Or if youre youre sixty years old your demands I think yeah I think also ID Yeah but a har A hard to lose is good ID So it should this question should be hard to lose PM Nee PM Hard to lose ID Its difficult to lose it PM Oh right UI Yeah this this is hard to lose PM It is hard to lose PM Yeah so then this is it is almost true so a two UI This Two yeah ID A two ID A two ID Okay UI And most all because of the option to Whoa ME Huh PM Ooh ID Yeah its okay ID That happens above also PM Oh UI Uh ID But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal but Yep ME Yeah ME Oh okay ME No ID Oh it isnt well okay PM Oh well it doesnt ID Remember UI put the cor cursor on the ME Okay okay okay ME Remote control mainly be sold to younger people UI Click UI True PM I think it will yeah ME Yeah UI True ME True ME Very true UI Uh yeah PM Uh well I a a two ME No I dont think very true because the colours UI Uh Materials yeah ID There ME We have the colours ME Um we have the buttons is arent that that much ME Nah the material isnt that So I don I think I think its a three PM Its its much more younger UI Uh okay UI So ma uh make it make it a two ID Well I think its its uh a lower number so better because w we designed it for young people especially didnt we PM Yeah ME Yeah but I uh Okay okay PM I think its a two but Two two two ID What do you think ME I think because yeah ID Questions UI A two UI I think its two ID Two UI I think its two too two too too ID Uhhuh PM Lets make everything a two ME In the features ID Dissatisfy younger people PM Younger people ID Um Yeah but those are more fancy functions not not really many features or something PM It has What did Yeah UI Well perhaps not ME Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing PM Well that it doesnt UI Well n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that but its for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs PM Yeah bu but I think they like the speech UI Yeah the speech possibility the colours PM You could call to your uh yeah and the screen yeah ME LCD screen and scroll UI Scroll options yeah ME I I think theyll be quite met with their expectations PM Right that that that those are features ME No ID It has relatively few features with Yeah ME Its three features basically the LCD touch screen is feature UI Yeah ME The microphone is a feature PM No arent the features the microphones feature and that you can change the channels feature and that you can change the volume is feature and that you can change the options of the remote uh uh something like that ME Yeah okay ID Ours had other features with Okay you think one what do you think ME I think yeah and then you have the audio settings channel setting video settings PM Yeah UI The easy volume up button PM Those are features UI Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume ME Yeah yeah UI Turn uh turn up the volume ME So Ive chos I shou I think its its its a one PM Enough features ME Personally yeah ME I think once youve cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features audio features the you have all buttons on it which youd like microphone extra LCD screen extra scroll thing extra PM Yeah PM I think two or three ID You ID three yeah UI Two ID Id say three so two it is then or Yeah PM Yeah PM Yeah uh a two a two ME Make it make it a two UI One two three ME Or make it uh a fucking two PM Just another two PM We like two UI Right ME You can see the remote control is R and R PM Yeah theres R and R in front UI Uh ID Yep PM Uh its not the colour so maybe you should make two but it has R and R ME Has oh yeah do did have nah y you have the black one PM Yeah ME And well probably make also a yellow one PM Yeah but not R and R yellow I think ID Yeah ID Yeah maybe maybe two ID Well m th but the logo is on on the front so a two yeah thats Oh well thats thats pretty good huh ME Maybe two UI Okay true yeah PM One d on i its the colours and the I think it is but I dont know what you think ME X marks spot ME And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use UI I think its easier to use than a regular remote control because when you push on the options menu you get the the the various options uh entirely explained ME Yeah tha thats so true ME Mmhmm UI Entirely explained UI Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button ME Mmhmm ME Yeah uh I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it PM And you can navigate easier because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal TV uh remote UI Yeah you can navigate UI Uh UI Youre not satisfied okay ME No Im not not convinc UI Lets start over again then PM Yeah PM Lets make a different remote ME Lets go th for I think it would be a t yeah two PM Well Menu PM A two ME Now lower UI A two PM We only have twos UI Oh yeah I think so UI Yeah PM Uh just twos ME So okay we have one three a one that that have to got up UI And three PM One three and a few ones PM Two threes ME Two two two two two PM We m mostly have twos so its pretty good ME So two yeah ME The average is a two PM Yeah ME That is quite good in my opinion UI The average PM Yeah PM I think so too UI Yeah I think so ME That Ooh PM We can be happy UI Save ME Ooh PM Yeah PM What is it PM Its like a bug or something UI Its a fly PM A fly yeah UI Oh m Yeah PM A f butterfly ME Top PM Yeah PM Thats it ME Okay ID That was your evaluation uh show okay so we dont have to calculate anything because of um these results ME Yes PM Sure ME No its two ID Okay good ME The average is two PM Its good ID Um lets see oh it isnt asked to save but it did already And this Everything okay PM Yeah ME Yeah I uh uh I uh saved it UI Exactly ID Well the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group but I am willing to try it ID Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that PM Yeah PM Redesign PM No ID And um Im not sure if I put it in the project folder ID look on that ID Um and were going to calculate the production costs and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty were good and if theyre not were going to uh redesign but we have to do that uh very very quick I think yes PM Yeah PM Yeah PM So were going to erase features or something ID Um I dont know if I put the Excel sheet in the n not in the folder PM Do you have the cost or uh Lets hope ME f fifty five Euros PM Were going to be here at eight oclock ID I think its I think its still in my own documents folder PM Were goin still going to be here at eight oclock ME No PM I doubt it ID Oh shit PM Perhaps weve got features that dont exist in the Excel sheet ME Yeah mm yeah maybe ID So Okay well this is it ME The microphone PM No it was in my uh my information so uh Yeah UI Yeah UI It i It wasnt too much ME Yeah ME maybe youre going scrap scrap it UI As well as the LCD screen UI Whoa PM Well if it doesnt work I want to fill it in but uh But you should uh direct The number of Weve got a battery one or t two batteries or not ID Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in so that I can also uh take minutes and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions ME No prob ME Ah ME Count it ME Li like write it be Ah okay cool ID Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things UI Count it ID But you have to fill in this column huh UI You got Excel to count ID No uh count uh number of functions because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots so or different different screens so Yeah but its its more about the energy source huh UI Oh okay UI Well I dra uh Danny Danny Ill do that because I draw the uh No no solar cell no no no no ME Huh ME Yeah ME Oh yea yeah you design it ME Um Yeah PM nee one battery with two small batteries ID Do you use a hand dynamo a battery kinetic or solar cells PM Yeah PM I would do a battery we do ME Solar cell PM Right ME No it took a battery PM A battery ID Well wait PM One battery right ID Yeah UI No hand dynamo ME Yeah UI Hand On advanced chip PM Electronics simple chip advanced chip right ME We have No we have sample speaker ME But b al but we also have sample speaker do Oh we already on nine UI Yeah yeah PM Yeah so this one and this one PM Uh we ha we have um single what PM Are we PM Oh yay ME We have double curved UI Single nee single curved PM The single ME Single UI Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional UI But it isnt three dimensional it isnt curved in a l No no no single curved is like this ME This one is This one is curved like this right PM Oh the the its not going to work uh people PM We have rubber ID Ill just fill it in ME Its curved like this ID Um rubber indeed ME Yeah bu what Oh but we have curves like it and it UI Uh thats the only curve you made not th uh curved like that UI Thats uh Huh ME There are two curves right PM Thirteen ME Oh okay I understand I understand PM With a scroll wheel right ME Rubber UI Yeah PM Is he integrated PM No eh PM I dont know ME Push button UI Yeah we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button because when you push it and you w it wont just pu uh makes possible to s Not going to work ME No we dont have push button PM Oh yeah right we want it to its not its not no ME LCD display UI Okay PM Yep PM Fifteen oh too bad UI Okay um But now button supplements PM Oh but with special colour we have PM A special form right UI We dont got the button supplements PM Oh we dont have any buttons so Yeah we need to uh No uh we have fifteen and oh right ME Eighteen and a half damn ME We have to lower it with six points UI Damn UI Okay ME Twelve and half PM We could lose the curve UI Nah ME We could use I think we should scrap the sample speaker PM Yeah I would lose the curve UI We could lose the scroll wheel UI You could make it just a regular scroll wheel PM But you cant push it so you have to tap UI Yeah if you cant push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button PM Yeah alright ID Yeah I think that will be our best bet PM So normal scroll wheel UI Normal scroll wheel PM And I think we should lose the curve UI Lose Okay so we dont exactly need the single We dont need a curve ME Its four pri it four units PM Yeah but if you would i it is a new feature it its something special ME But w d wha Curved then it will be square PM No the curve doesnt really No then it will wont uh stand up from the table UI S possible to lose curve PM Then it would just Yeah UI Okay ME Was that does that mean to it single curve UI Yeah thats meant with scr uh with s curve UI The curve is uh in a dimension ME Okay UI If you make it a flat one s n its no curve you got no curves PM So We would lose this one ME Yeah but tha that that only is one UI Yeah okay PM Yeah we could s yeah a bit UI No two ME No one PM Sixteen point three UI Oh okay indeed ME So we dont Yeah we also have to No otherwise we dont have an LCD screen PM So we still Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something UI Is it possible to make No PM No PM Ma y you just cant do that or uh We changed th Yeah and the single curved to uncurved ID And what did you change ID You changed the uh scroll wheel and Oh but its just one point so maybe you should should uh Yeah you should you should drop the speech recognition ME Single curved ME Flat ME Yeah so that does doesnt doesnt that mu I think Scrap sample speaker PM No ME That thats uh Yes four points UI The sample speaker is two d wait f s four points PM Yeah but its t Yeah but it is uh it it is a new feature it is something special ID And then you can keep the curve ID Or cant you UI Yeah uh becau uh when you lose the Yeah ME Yeah but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ME F You have to we have to scrap four points PM I dont know PM Yeah thats difficult ID Or make it on a hand dynamo but I dont think that will work PM Yeah ME Ma make it with wood instead of rubber UI No thats no UI Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood PM Uh ME Yeah it it i Yeah it also uh it also takes one point less UI You dont make a remote control of Ah ID Yeah mmhmm PM We could make it titanium instead of rubber ID Yeah but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed yes PM Oh PM Oh can I ask something PM What is special colour ME Yeah PM Is that the wood uh wood uh this we have to have that one too ME I think it is UI It isnt UI What ME Yeah ID Yeah but its only a half ID But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker ME Yeah ME Sample speaker UI To knock the sample speaker yeah UI And sample sensor PM Th then we still have too much if we use the uh Yeah we we scrap that one ME Yeah okay three UI But m yeah course but What well have ME Point three ME Huh UI Lets make it thirteen or fourteen ME Point twelve PM See a po three PM We need point three ME Thats a scroll wheel PM Uh its a colour PM Dont make it wood UI A colour ME Yeah but a wood we can make it brown dark brown not wood PM Make it uh Yeah but its its special colour is it a all kind of colours UI Yeah special colours fruity colours PM Its also green or uh Yeah but its a special colour than just rubber colour ME Is it also no that thats just normal colour fruit colours UI Yeah ME Normal colours yellow Yeah but then I d I dont think we can ever make to a twelve and half PM You have to add something to the rubber to make it green UI Yeah PM You dont say heres green rubber UI They dont sell green rubber plants UI Alright PM Yeah you can you should you have to lose No it is the scroll wheel I guess ME But then we have to scrap LCD display we have to scrap uh s advanced chip UI No no no ME No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ME Five UI If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then its possible to make ME Then we have two ME S touch PM A push yeah ME Then we can make add two colours on it UI And then you can and then you can add to the colours ME Yeah two colours it UI Special c Okay if you lose uh if you lose the You lose this one you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve for example PM Switch colours PM It was such a great idea ME They can add two colours ME But the colours ME Um how ma uh the colours like l she told is that all the colours we add or Yeah but we we we are we have yellow red uh black titanium UI How d uh uh how many colours PM What do you mean UI Special colours all the colours you want because you want to make p Yeah but uh when you use more than one colour its a special colour ME Ah okay PM Oh PM But I think when you use the colour thats not originally the rubber then you use special colour cause you have to add it UI I suppose UI Yeah ME Yeah but the rubbers alls original black PM Yeah so you always lose the special colour PM You co you could make it always black like normal remote ME Yeah b Yeah but were gonna make it yellow uh red and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now UI Nee we we also want to make ano another colour PM Oh right yeah PM Yeah we should u Yeah ME Yeah but m Yeah because we have more colours than only black PM We have to make this like four or five or something PM Thats what it means ID Yeah but isnt it per remote that you pay PM Yeah ME I then I think I p I don I dont think they me mean theyre special Yeah okay okay true PM Oh right yeah ID Half PM Is it per remote ID I think you pay half per remote PM Yeah PM Yeah thats right and you one colour per remote ID So each remote with a special colour UI Yeah indeed yeah PM So then it is one UI You dont need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote ME True true PM No ID I hope ME We have two points spare ID So the battery we have um advanced chip on print ME Nee one point PM One PM So it would be curved single curve ID Because of thing Yeah well you can at least make it curved again PM Or not UI Hmm PM So y you just cant make a nice remote UI Yeah single curve ID Because that was very important huh PM Its too bad for the speaker ID So its curved its still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker PM Should we change that tha that thats a one if not or not ME Mm yep ID We dropped the scroll wheel PM Could you copy it PM And make it uh The entire uh Perhaps you can then copy page or so ID And the rest is the same huh ME Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped ID Am I right ID Yes UI Uh ME Yep UI Huh PM Ooh PM No UI Okay PM Oh you you made the entire could you Oh not Well UI Undo undo UI Undo UI So kay UI Twenty minutes PM Would you PM By the Perhaps you can save this one and then copy or something PM Add it copy page PM Select all ID No but you c yeah PM Alright something went wrong ME Tap ID Okay but this this new remote we can afford PM It doesnt work PM Lets forget ME It shouldve work UI Okay so you had this list at start ID Hmm UI Alright ID No I hadnt UI When did you receive this list ID I just received it UI Ah okay PM Yeah PM Oh ignore that ID They dont work so hard at the finance department UI Ah okay UI I suppose this is a Okay so we lose the scroll wheel the s And the microphone PM Well so Too bad PM Yeah PM The microphone ID Yeah and thats it PM Yeah PM A and we changed something I guess or not PM We Oh no ME Yep UI Okay ID Twelve Euro fifty ID Um and did you try to make a new design or what were you trying to do PM Yeah I tried to copy that one but it didnt work ID It didnt work PM So we could fix it like tha that its like this ID Hmm ID Strange PM You could select it all but then you cant erase UI Strange ID Oh you can arrange Hmm cant you then just say copy UI You can only re erase PM Erase UI Oh PM When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it w I couldnt erase anything UI Uh no UI Bling ID New page ID Paste ID Yes UI Ah ID Select none PM Just tap somewhere UI just up somewhere b uh besides it right ME just tap somewhere ID Okay and now you can erase PM Yeah PM I dont think I can but uh we can try UI Uh we already try ID Well it should be possible PM Oh yeah no haha ID Oh no ID Well you can draw over it with white uh pen ME No PM Yeah we tried it earlier ID Oh PM Its very much work ID Yeah ID Sorry ID Well but thats also useful for the evaluation because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design ME Evaluation drops ID Doodle ID And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time ME And erase the mic PM Yeah goodbye mic UI All I need is no mic ID Lets see we can save this now PM Oh I already erased half of the line UI Bon chance No add Yeah ID And move back to here PM Too bad oh PM Like this ID Mmhmm PM Still looks nice ID And then all green ID Okay well thank you PM Oh thats erase ME Looks like a iPod ID Oh no ID Hey but you can erase that PM Yeah thats a bit weird ID Uhoh PM Oh now Im line UI S Difference between lines and text and the pen PM Yeah ME Oh ID Right ME All I need is mic ID And you cant erase this ID Hmm strange PM No its weird ID Okay well uh just leave it at this and quickly save ME Station page ID Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation UI Huh looks fucking boring now ID We just did our project evaluation ID Um well I think I can sit for that since its almost my final slide ID Um what did you think about uh the process ID How satisfied are we UI Deadlines were sometimes very short PM Yeah ID Mmhmm PM Bu but stressful UI But And stressful PM You think no my presentation isnt ready ID Yeah ME I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together PM Yeah ME Now we worked through each other something he said yeah and you had information I also had so some some things I had in my presentation they already told so So yeah that I dont think that is the best way to work at for such project ID Yeah ID And you could ask things PM Yeah you had information I didnt have and then uh Oh right UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Yeah ID And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what huh PM Yeah ID And uh Yeah PM No ID So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work ME Yeah no or maybe session of five minutes together or something and then work separate UI Yeah but but why not work here together for example ID Yeah PM Yeah you could Yeah UI Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ME Yeah ME Yeah ID Mmhmm ID Well probably to simulate the whole working uh process huh th you cant have a meeting uh for several weeks PM I think so too UI Yeah PM Yeah but then you can work together too when A chat would also be uh Well I I dont really like the board it doesnt really work great ME Yeah m yeah like she told ME Then you can work together too by mail or by I dunno chat something but now were completely separated from each other UI Huh oh right ID No ME I dont think that was the best way but Yeah the technologys okay UI But the technology was uh fantastic UI Work now ME Yeah okay but I don I do I think becau thats because Yeah PM Sometimes I think UI Perhaps it is e Yeah perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there PM It does work but sometimes it doesnt erase or it doesnt uh Yeah UI So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen ME Yeah like the f like a plotters or something yeah PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Yep yep yep yep yep ID So you dont think the SMARTboard is is really useful or Yeah so its maybe a bit unnatural also PM But Well it is useful but it doesnt really work all the time UI Its useful but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below ME Yeah it is useful but No PM Th the pen doesnt The line is a bit off ME Yep UI Alright PM Yeah you can point to where you want the line to be PM But Yeah UI The project uh because of the deadlines you didnt had the time to uh have you didnt have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation UI So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the Oh ID That wasnt me ID Uh so um the means we discussed the smart board and what about uh this digital pen UI Wasnt me PM Yeah PM I I I used it it it was you can use it its quite handy I think ME I didnt use it at all ID Yeah well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer huh UI But I didnt I uh I used it too but oh well PM Yeah I used it to y to Yeah it did work pretty well ME I didnt use UI Yeah PM I dont think why you would want to use it actually but it it does work UI Yeah because it shou To make some designs it is very easy ME No yeah ID Yeah ME It is it is yeah it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer UI Yeah PM Yeah and then you can show it to everybody ME Yeah UI But to write it th yeah ME Yeah ME Its b bi little bit too big to write PM It doesnt really write normally PM Its a bit Yeah UI Yeah its too big its too fat ME Yeah ID Yeah ME Fat document those ID Okay um and what about the teamwork ME Team work was okay PM I think it was great yeah UI Yeah ID Yeah well I think so too ME Only thing that we worked through past each other ID we Yeah but that was it was our assignment huh UI Right ME With some things that was only problem but Yeah yeah yeah but furthermore better PM Yeah but it was because we didnt uh Yeah ID Okay and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point the leadership ME Thats yeah no prob PM I thought it was good but uh Yeah UI Yeah ME Ah ID Yeah well okay PM Yeah UI Not too much not too too too too ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Okay ID And creativity ID Well when we look at this Id say we have been creative huh ID But There was room for You did PM Well UI Yeah or the room for it was the idea to be creative so You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out PM Yeah ME Mmhmm PM And you get get stuff from the from the computer but Yeah UI Yeah UI The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or Yeah ME Little bit uh lo yeah ME Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah PM You just sit there for ten minutes PM Yeah where is that email ME I played I think seven times Solitaire something ID Well I didnt have time for that PM Oh did you PM Is it on there ME Wha Oh right it is there PM Is it on there PM I didnt find the didnt look but uh I didnt look but I got like one email after ten minutes or something ID At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment and then I even got spam UI Was searching and searching ME No I I never got that ME I always N yeah ID Or something like that PM Thats what we said ME So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think sometimes in in in in the beginning I didnt understand what what to do PM And it not a lot uh No the first one UI No w I didnt know Make a r yeah ME Yeah like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control PM I didnt know uh nee PM And I didnt know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here so I went right ME Yeah so So yeah UI Yeah UI No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page PM Yeah ID And I was working and working and work Okay well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied but it it couldve been uh better PM Just looking at the screen and uh Yeah an Yeah that will be handy UI No ME Yeah ID When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information ME Mmhmm UI Yeah more information about the costs ME Faster ME Yeah UI First of all I didnt think uh that we were able to make an LCD screen uh first point but uh it was possible uh uh yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah it only costs four units ME Uh yeah PM Yea uh so tha actually you could make an LCD screen but no mic or it could make mic but no LCD screen when you look at that ID Yeah ID Yeah that was a bit mean to put it in the end UI Yeah PM Yeah ID And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process PM Uh I dunno ME Um Yeah PM Think thats about it ME Nothing PM Hmm ME I think we got it already PM Heavier um less heavy laptops ID Yeah theyre pretty heavy ME Yeah UI Uh UI Faster laptop PM Yeah UI Uh UI They were they were just fine PM But thats not really uh Yeah ME And furthermore the the the network was okay ME Everything you loaded was also av available there UI Uh PM Yeah everything worked UI Right ID And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work is what you say ME So Yeah UI Yeah ID Okay ME Yeah but that Its now half past four half past three so Yeah okay PM Yeah but its just the the off hours between that you will work alone ME Yeah okay PM Then it pops up pop up screen came ME Mmhm PM Five minutes in the meeting ME Mm ME Yeah UI Mm PM No ID Okay so more time during the individual work phases PM Huh ID Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes so Ill move on to I guess my last slide yes which is the closing PM You did PM Well Oh right ID Well uh we managed but we did it very quickly ID I dont know if thats the best way to when it isnt is it when it is too expensive to quickly rearrange it and say okay this is it but we had to do it huh because we have to have a design and that is within the budget PM Well Yeah ID And we evaluated ID Maybe we should reevaluate uh the product but we did that before and we also evaluated the project ID And I think uh everybodys uh very happy ID At least I am with the results so uh celebration well for the three of you because uh I have to write the final report now ME Yeah PM Champagne ID But uh well thank you very much for your cooperation and I had a very nice day so far PM Yeah UI Yeah sure ME No prob UI Oh thank you ME Mmhmm ID Okay PM Do we get another email UI Bling ME I think you do UI Youre fired ID Um Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again but um well I at least PM I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again but We do UI Mm ID But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this so I can try to include it in the final report PM Yeah PM Uh th that that one UI You cannot you can save it ID Yeah maybe PM You can just Yeah but its it isnt a picture or well is it ID wants to but at least this one ID I know we should remove this but it wont h Okay UI You s uh file save as the J PEG J PEG ID And uh please put it in the project folder then huh ME Can you find it as a J PEG UI No PM No isnt possible PM But you can make a screen shot I think ID Okay well I uh I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon ME No UI No PM Yeah UI Okay ME In uh Celebra Or shouldnt I UI In about five minutes PM Uh oh export ID Well I think well be a bit a bit longer but okay UI Ah ID Well happy celebration huh UI Oh thank you PM Images UI Whoohoo UI Lets lets have party PM How big do you want the images UI Lets have some fun ID How big UI Huh PM Yeah ID Uh not too big PM This one ME Six hundred ID Whatever you think is good ME No I yeah UI No that uh is one thousand twenty four ME I think eight hundred six hundred is better PM This one ME Yeah UI Yeah UI If it browse ME Nah name PM Um Well it isnt on the desktop UI Desktop ME Hey UI Mm UI I do not know PM You can only save it in my documents UI Oh ME Oh my God UI Yeah PM Oh PM Oh alright PM Yeah UI Okay PM Yeah PM Yeah PM Three PM Can we stay here ME Ten ME Yeah ME Ten PM Yeah ME Uh UI Okay PM Yeah alright PM Why cant we stay here UI Alright PM Yeah UI Oh ME Celebration time come on UI Oh ME Peace out nigger,"The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator. The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype. The team found the remote to be fancy, innovative, fairly easy to use, available in different colors, fairly spongy, difficult to misplace, and targeted to younger people. The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote. The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design. The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process. The team found the project stressful, the equipment useful, the information available to them lacking, and their laptops to be slow and heavy."
ME Hello ME Dang it ID And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot ME Alright ID Its important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here PM Okay PM No thats okay PM Joost your mouse ME What PM No mouse needed ME Ive got a touchpad ME Do you know how how I can wake it up PM Mm PM A touchpad ME No my laptop PM Slap it ME You with your brilliant ideas ME I dont know if I can touch the power button ME Do you know how how I can wake it up PM Is Um F five ID No ID Yeah ID Try the power button ME Oh ME Come on move it ME Now wake up bitch ID Huh PM F five UI Ive lost my screen UI Uh Yes ME Yeah so did I ME I closed it PM I dont ME That wasn that wasnt very smart I guess ME Come on ME Get back to me ME Yes UI I closed the No ME I closed it PM Youve got your name ID Yeah my name is name ME No I didnt restart it I just closed it ME Yes PM Hope it working ME Alright PM Never close your laptop ID Yeah ID Everybodys ready ME Great PM Yeah ID Great ME Thanks ID Well welcome to the kickoff meeting ID I uh forgot to put my name over here its uh its Martin ID Uh so you all know ID Well this is the agenda for today ID Well the opening is what Im doing right now ID Uh we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things ID Uh give some um examples of the tool training project plan discussion and the closing ID We have twenty five minutes ID Okay the project aim is to design a new remote control ME Mmhmm ID Uh some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original trendy and userfriendly ID So now we all know what our goal is PM Okay ID Um I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part but we we all know each other ID We all know each others names ID Joost Guido Antek ME Yes PM What is your name UI Yes UI Antek PM Antek Ahmet ID Okay PM And Joost ID I think we uh al already uh been through that part PM Okay PM Yeah ID Okay it consists of uh three levels of design ID Uh we begin with the functional design then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design ID Every uh level of design consists of some individual work and we uh close it with a meeting ID You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions and uh you p you probably read that already so I dont have to tell you about that ME Yes PM Yes ID Okay first were gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools ID We have the smartboards uh the thes those two boards ID This is the presentation boards wh which one Im using right now ID You can uh um theres a document folder called um the sh shared document folder ID You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen ID We also have the whiteboard ID Uh were gonna skip through th No no PM Can we see the whiteboard on our laptops ID Just on the on the screen over there PM No I saw I saw the file the smartboard that XBK but Okay ID Oh no ID Probably is but I dont know if the software is on the laptop ID Is is if its mainly a thing for in the meeting so I dont think its I dont know if its important ID This an explanation of the smartboards ID There is a toolbar over here ID Its quite simple ID You have the the pen function eraser function ID Its like a very simple uh paint application ID Uh we well we use the same file during uh the whole day and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button ID It works like this ID Oh ID If pen is selected yes ID Oh no no PM With that pen ID Its not But it is pen ID Its not working like a pen yet PM Mm ID Huh ID Huh PM Mm ID Its doing some stuff now PM Little bit slower ID So you can use a pen ID You can use an eraser ID And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward which y you have to select pen format ID And then select current colour or line width ID So its quite easy ID Uh well now youre all uh acquainted with the different tools ID Right were gonna try out the electronic whiteboards ID Uh every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on blank sheets with different colours with different pen widths ID Uh Ill start off then ID Ill use this uh same sheet ID Alright ID Oh let me think ID Different colours ID Oh ID Well Im gonna draw um a p piranha ID Uh a fish PM piranha PM Okay ID Uh ID Mmhmm PM Oh ID Im gonna use some different colour now ID Some a little white ID Looks like a fish ID Think it is ID Oh ID Oh ID Uh colour ID This is black ID I think so PM Yellow Hmm ID Oh ID Oh this is just uh useless uh drawings but Oh teeth ID I need teeth ID Well theyre not supposed to be green or whatever colour this is ID Okay ID What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth PM Different ID Plus uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh well a small actual face ID And I like its overall uh aggressive look and Well thats what I like about uh piranha PM Okay ID I think thats kind of what uh the intention should be ID Well who wants to be next ME Nobody I guess PM I will try ID You go Guido PM Yeah ID Okay PM I will try PM Uh Blank ID Uh make a new sheet ID Uh its by pressing on blank ID Yep PM Okay PM Then pen again ID Yep PM Okay ID And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths PM Okay um control ME Format PM Uh Ah purple PM Um I dont know what my uh favourite uh animal is but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird PM Uh I will Thats my bird ME You know I thought of that actually PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Isnt it quite its a little bit light PM Uh another colour maybe PM A red one PM A small one PM Uh line width PM Two PM Three PM Oh thats okay PM Thats another one ID Well tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds PM Ano Uh uh its a Yeah its uh the most simple uh animal I know I think ME Its simplicity PM Um I dont know PM Maybe because uh theres theres some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that ID Oh okay ID Okay PM Maybe a little bit PM Yeah PM I dont know ID Okay ID No uh its clear PM So more uh birds ID N no no ID We get your point PM Okay okay okay ID Okay ID Who wants to be next ME Yeah whatever ME Ill go next ME Thanks ME I havent got a favourite animal too so Oh PM M Pictionary ME What should I draw PM A cow ID Oh ME Thank you Ill draw a penguin PM Okay ME Yeah ME Ill draw a penguin ME Whatever ME I cant draw so you can start to laugh already ID Ill do so ME Whatever ME Something like that ME Come on PM Yeah its little bit hard ME Mm hmm hmm orange PM Orange of course ME Whatever ME Oh its better than your bird PM Uh yeah ME Everythings better than your bird PM Yeah PM True ME Whatever ME Hey its blue ME No ME Whatever ME Um I like its ugliness and uh Yeah whatever ME The way it walks or whatever ID Okay ME Your turn UI Kay ME Drawing UI Im going to draw a cat UI I dont know why but a cat is a very uh smart animal UI And you can have them at home UI Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and Ye yes yeah ID Well you can have a piranha at home ID Huh ME Or a line PM A little bit ME I mean a bird PM Yeah PM Dont mess with my birds yeah UI Its not very uh very good drawn but you can see a cat from it ME Hmm ME Its a handicapped cat PM cat ID I dont think uh I dont think uh Darwin would agree with that UI Its Ah its not scared UI Hes crying but Uh its i most cats are small ID Okay ME Hes crying because its ugl because of his ugliness ID What do you like about it then ID Oh okay UI You can handle them ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay and then we are uh through the tool training I guess PM Okay ME I wouldnt call it training but Alright ID Okay this is uh something about the project finance ID The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros ID And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros ID Were very ambitious on this one ID The market range is international so its gonna be sold worldwide and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control ID So thats clear ID Yeah PM Okay ID Okay were now gonna discuss some stuff when well were gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control its gonna be ID Uh well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls ID Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ID Or do they annoy you sometimes UI Yes ID Are they difficult to understand or maybe they dont interact with different kind of uh equipment very well PM Hmm ME I dont th I dont think the four of us got problems with remote controls but if you see elderly people all these buttons and then they buy new TV because their previous one was stolen or whatever ID Yeah okay PM Different ID Okay ME And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places and half of the functions a are removed or whatever ME Uh so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons you know ME All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh Well one area or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um yeah to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else ID Different functions of of uh Okay ME I think we should group them ID Yeah ME And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Well I was I was thinking uh since a TV is uh mostly used together with a VCR or DVD player or recorder and not with a stereo I think it should be good to include functions for VCRs and DVD players recorders ID Okay ID And uh is it gonna be a remote control thats um what it can be used for different kind of equipment like your TV and your home stereo PM Yeah ID Uh Mmhmm ID Mmhmm ID But uh the DVD players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hifi sets probably ME Yeah ID Its what from my experience PM But isnt it Its only for television I thought ME I dont know ME Hifi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television ID Okay ID But we gonna Oh it is only for televis So wha what What wha what uh what document But where where did it uh Where did you find that ME Yes PM Not I thought it was only for television PM So so we probably dont have to have to uh have the functions for DVD player or VCR ME Yes it is only for television but uh Well well we were gonna brainstorm about that ME If we think its useful we do it PM Uh in the email ID Oh okay ME Thats right PM I thought it said uh Yeah television remote control ME Its a television remote control ME But I was thinking since it is useful with DVD Yep UI Yes Yes thats uh something extras ID Yeah but most television remote controls support other functions as well ID So we can No we have to think about that PM True PM Yeah PM True ID Okay uh but uh weve gonna put some a uh is is it so userfriendliness is a is a pri priority in this case or Okay ME Yeah also no ones gonna buy it UI Yeah PM Yeah yeah PM Yeah ME I guess UI Only the experts PM True ID Well this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful ME Yeah ID That w Well then youre youre the usability uh man so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then PM Oh my God ME Yeah PM Okay ID Okay ID Well other ideas ID How can we make it trendy or something ID Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it UI Uh to go with to go with fashion and Team Leader ID Maybe a can opener underneath it ID I dont know PM For the bear ID Or someth something special like uh MP three player inside of it or uh Oh well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably PM Uh I I uh no I think it Uh I th I think yo we have to keep it simple to get a whole market ME Yeah way too high ME Yep PM Its international so we have to use a standard ID Okay ID Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably ME Well thats an idea of course yeah ID Uh original trendly and userfriendly Well we al also already talked about userfriendliness ME Mmhmm PM Hmm ID No well something trendy and original well that that goes hand in hand I guess ME Yeah ID When something is original it tends to be trendy probably or we should make it combination of that ID Kay so you the um technical part of the process is something youre gonna look after for so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh you know you want to manage with it ID Well and thats an important part for you then with gogors regards to the userfriendly part of it PM Use friendly PM Yep ID Well and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy ID Well you know y like some special feature ID Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something ME Yeah ME Yes what the market wishes ID Okay ID Well the closing ID Next meeting starts in thirty minutes ID Individual I think so ID The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design of course we will uh Already s said that ID The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design PM Yeah PM Yeah yeah ME Yeah PM Interface d Oh I dont I didnt get a message ID And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert ID User requirements specifi Well this one was already clear to us ID Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach ID I dont know how much time we have left ID Oh not many I guess ID We started at twelve ME You just got a message ID Oh and what does it said ME And it said uh five minutes so we got four and a half ID W Okay well um No were uh ahead of schedule then ME No ME Hes the whatever PM Oh the Project Manager ME Team Leader ME He is the whatever ID Yeah close it ID Im gonna make some minutes or take some minutes PM Okay ID And uh its its clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations ME Yes PM Okay ID You can all Or were all uh Yeah ME Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the whiteboard ID Yeah but were all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint are we ME Yeah ME Yes PM Yeah ID Yeah okay ID Im gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then were ready ME Alright ME Okay ID Or we can leave already I guess ID or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh Okay ME Yeah UI No ME No ME I dont think so PM I dont think Oh I will need it ME Yes ID Yes ME Great UI Oh ID Well see each other in uh thirty minutes ME Yeah ME Good luck ID Yeah good luck ME I will need it,"The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops. The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, to design a remote control. The remote should be trendy, original and user friendly. The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard, and the group did a tool training exercise, using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals. The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit. The group discussed initial ideas for the remote, including that it should be a simple design with grouped buttons. They discussed whether the remote should include functions for controlling video and DVD players. The project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting."
PM Here we go again UI My mouse is not working anymore PM Oh ME Oh UI Hes uh when I put it in is is going to beep beep beep PM Okay ME Oh I got a nice little screen here over here ME I got like this big black border uh on every side ID Okay PM Mm okay ID Everybody ready ME Ill Ill fix it PM Yeah its okay ME Yeah whatever ID Welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by Maarten ID Uh this is the agenda the opening ID Uh weve got three presentations ID And Im gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me ID And were gonna make a decision on the remote control functions ID We have uh forty minutes ME Yes ID Oh well this is the the closing already ID So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then ID Uh I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order PM Okay ID Maybe the Well it Oh that ME I dont know what the right order is ME So Mmhmm PM No UI Huh ID It wont doesnt Maybe we should start with the the technical functions UI Okay how can I get this on the whiteboard ID Yeah ID Well its you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder PM In project UI Okay Ive done that ID Youve already done that PM No can that open UI Yes ID Well lets close this one ID Well just uh open a new one PM Open it there ID Uh well ID Yes ID Uhoh ID New thing ID Oh yeah uh I have to say something ID Uh due to some uh technical problems I havent uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes ID But Ill uh make sure that uh happens next time PM Okay PM About the get Okay ID And Ill get this one uh in digital uh form too UI Kay were going to um uh talk about working design UI Um the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy it activates a chip uh in the remote UI Its an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television UI Mm its a nowadays very uh known a known uh uh technology UI Um the known technology can make a cost very low UI Uh its a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world UI And and the components are very uh very cheap UI Um Uh diodes uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights theyre needed and theyre uh everywhere available UI Uh again its a fair price UI Its a common uh technology uh like I told um Uh the circuit board its the most um important uh um part of the remote control UI Uh we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires its it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper UI Its uh its all very uh Yeah theyre making it uh all the time ID Okay UI Uh and its not uh very specialised uh technology ID Okay UI I havent come to here but um Ive got uh some uh images of uh remote controls UI They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows UI So I dont know uh why I should put it here UI Uh Yes but uh I uh havent made it because uh of the time ID Okay ID But its the technical side of the remote control ID Oh ID Okay UI But What ID Well well well have to skip that part then ID But you dont think its a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control UI No ID Its gonna be easy UI Yes ID Okay PM But nothing restricted for user interface ID Yeah PM With technical I dont know UI Um no its uh its just a part of uh a known technology yeah ID M Okay PM Kay UI Remote control is nothing special nowadays ID R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement PM Okay ID Doesnt really matter UI Um I dont think so because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote PM But I kind of uh Yes ID Okay ID Yeah okay PM Uh Well the technical functions ID Okay ID Well well see ID Well see later on PM Um well I dont know if you got the same uh pictures as I got but uh I got these two and I think theyre we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user ID No UI No PM th I think its its very much uh depending on the user requirements I dont s uh know whos doing t Yeah but it I think thats very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control ID Well uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ID The ones I Ive uh received from the account manager ID Yeah ID Well well keep this in mind and then discuss it later on PM Yeah well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it ID Uhhuh ID Okay but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote ID we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ME Yes I agree ME Yeah ID Well what thats what you want trying to say PM Well yeah w if you want try a a a huge market if you want to reach a huge market uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user ID Okay ID Okay PM But I dont know PM Its its really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use ID Yeah well some of these Uh yeah ID Well some of that will Yeah but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements PM Yeah probably yeah ME Yes ID So Mmhmm PM Uh well there are l at least uh basic functions uh like just th the channels uh one till nine uh on and off switch which must be clear with a red button or something like that PM Um most standard uh have volume of course and a mute function and of course the next and previous channel PM I think thats just basic what we need PM And from that on we can user requirements what we need more PM Uh Yeah I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets and I dont know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions more buttons maybe its com becoming less trendy or something like that ME Yes PM M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that ME I havent really found a conclusion like that ME Yeah PM I dont know PM Uh I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah more trendier design I think ME Design PM I think ME Sounds interesting PM Yeah PM Uh well thats all I have to say I think ID Okay PM Yeah that was it ME Alright ID Well then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market ME Yes ME Yeah ME Its alright ME Um Alright Ive done some research for functional requirements ME Um yes ME The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people uh how do you say uh f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions ME Uh Ive lined them up here ME Uh ask whether um common remote control looks good or not about willingness to spend money on remote control about zapping behaviour and uh and stuff like that ME I uh have found some interesting things ME We do we do got a market ME Um three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly ME So if we make a trendy design we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market which you can reach ME Um three out of four users uh zaps a lot as I uh quoted here from the uh results ME Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour ME Thats quite a lot ME Um relevant options are of course power buttons ME Although only used once per hour ME Uh channel selection volume and buttons for text and the more um yeah other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used ME Furthermore fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control ME That doesnt say we got we can leave ninety percent off ME But it sure um says we shouldnt make it too uh complicated ME Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room ME And um an important thing here the most important customers uh which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old ME And uh elderly people our market are less interested in uh nice features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls ME So what I was thinking oh wrong side ME We shouldnt implement too much features on uh on our remote control because elderly people will get th lost ME Group features for a higher usability uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting ME Um all the settings about audio settings video settings and channel settings which are not very often used we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever because they are used very rarely and well it uh there are a lot of options there so we can really make uh yeah how do you say we can spare at buttons over there ID Okay ME And um if you want to implement VCR and DVD options group them in the button not too uh Yeah ME Small buttons so they wont be very um how do you say Yes wont be very present thank you ID Visually presents ME And a trendy look well uh although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who dont really care for trendy looks or whatever I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent ME That was kind of what I found ID Okay PM Okay ME Okay ID Well then we Im gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important ME Yes ID Uh well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant I think ID Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward ID Well now I see four ME Two ID Thats kinda strange ID Well they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet ID Well I think that may be so but well we cant just leave the teletext button off PM Well No way ME No uh I agree I agree ID Its impossible I think ID So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button you know like on and off and dont make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know its just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext but not to play with it that much ME Not too much no ME Yeah ID So we have to think of that ID The remote control should only be used for television ID Otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market ID So maybe we should leave all DVD and VCR related features off completely PM Yeah ME Okay ID I dont know ID I think that uh thats what theyre trying to say ID Uh our current customers are within the age group of forty plus ID New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty ID So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested ME Mmhmm ID But well theyre not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah but it is its is a dif its a fact that the th th that bigger market youre talking about we already cover that ME I dont really agree actually to be honest ME Its a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty ME Its only like thirty percent of the total market ME Mayb yeah ID Our company already sells remote control to the older people but we we also want you know a new customer group ID Thats the one we havent covered yet ID So I think thats what the problem is ID We havent got remote controls for uh Well I think yeah ME Okay ME Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit ID Yeah I think so ID Maybe if its no no but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants ME Not too much then bu alright ID So maybe we can make a remote control thats primarily interesting for the younger group but isnt that bad for an older person either ME Yes ID Uh our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products ID Our products corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design ID Okay something else nice to know PM But whats our slogan ID Sorry ID Yeah you will have to look that up PM The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics ME Yeah Ill have a look ME We put the fashion in electronics ID I think its something about the Oh okay ID I thought it w might be lets make things better or something but Okay well lets go back to the the agenda ME Sense and simplicity PM Sense simplicity ID So weve now had to the three presentations ID We know about the new project requirements ID That means we can uh well d yeah discuss on the remote control functions ID Well if I can uh make a start I think its becoming more clear what kind of remote control its gonna be and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it ID I think were were looking for some Yeah we were looking for a really simple remote control with only basic TV functions ID Y well that Yeah PM Yeah ME Well to be honest if um our uh aim group is uh till forty not older than forty maybe thats not very uh yeah we dont really need to have a simple remote control ID Yeah ME I think we can implement more functions then because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes PM Yeah but wha But Yeah but you sai you said that that a lot of functions arent used ID Yeah yeah ID M yeah thats why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me I think they are are c are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design and no uh other uh s functions than just TV but they s do aim at a younger Well ma But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the know th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room like a t TV and a DVD player ME Yeah PM So why should j we put this function in ME Well I think Yes PM I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions ID You can uh know you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the TV set on your remote control uh with the with uh the you know audio settings and uh v uh screen settings ID We dont want that ID I think that was that became clear ID We dont want ID But w maybe we should put some func uh I know that the younger people will most likely have a DVD player they want to you know they want to uh control remotely ME Yeah control PM Yeah but uh you said Yeah d yeah but th the functions are not in the remote control were making ID No yeah th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah PM Its n Yeah PM Yeah ID I think we maybe should Yeah well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it ID But just the basic functions ID Maybe like rewind and wind or n what d what do you guys think UI But you can put them under the same button ME Not much more than that ME Yep ID Yeah if as far as possible ME Or we can u u we could put em behind the flipflap or whatever ME So t Yeah ID But what do you think ID Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices PM No ID No you dont think so PM No new requirements say no ID Yeah the new requirements say so PM So Yeah but I i if its too simple uh th they wont use the remote control they use their own th th with lot more functions UI But you can put a play and stop and and rewind ID Well maybe its maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions dont support the particular device as well as their their own remote control ID You know a lot of DVD players have some tricky settings with Yep exactly UI Yes but we Huh ME Y yes ID Thats thats wha No no you dont No no you dont need it ME But but for for example VCR thats better example in this case ME I think on a remote control for television you dont need to be able to programme uh the VCR to start recording at three PM or whatever just play stop rewind and uh fast forward PM No no PM Exactly ID No no ID Okay but we have to think uh w we have to think DVD I th uh I guess so um but uh from my experience its kinda a lot of DVD players you know like forwarding goes differently ME Yeah I know but uh Yes ID Uh you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed PM Mm yeah ID Its c sometimes a bit difficult ID Maybe if we just leave the DVD functional m uh Well I was thinking about putting it in but concerning the project requirements and what you just said I think we m should focus on the TV then PM Yeah but just keep it simple and look more at th No ID And uh and its just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one ID If you want to keep it simple you can make a universal remote PM Its only for television ID Okay PM So Yeah UI Yes but there are there are But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ID Its just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table and its just for when you you you jump on the couch you pick up the the the nice remote the simple one just to put on the television nothing more ME Yeah PM Yeah nothing more ID Okay PM Exactly ME Alright ID Um but what televis Yeah we well make w this one trendy UI There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have Yes but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages PM Yeah ID And simple PM The user interface is easy ID Well we we will come to that but ju first on the on the functions ID So we should put uh zap buttons on it ID Um also numbers to uh to go to the specific channels PM And the basic yeah basic functions yeah ME Yes definitely yeah ID Uh Okay a t a teletext button should be there PM Its too much integrated in the other ID But just one big teletext button on and off PM Yeah ID Probably ME Yeah and maybe two or three other options but not nothing more than that ME I think stop function is very useful ME If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick reader then I think its very irritating if the next page shows up but Well I use it very regularly the action ID Oh okay ID Yeah but uh I think that becomes too difficult its not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then ME I re I use it quite often ID Yeah yeah but maybe you s yeah yeah maybe y you do but Ive never heard of it in the first place PM Will you look Look at the market ID And we have to well t yeah and t and teletext is becoming outdated ID We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably ID Yeah ID I dont know ID I think that thats kin getting too complex for our remote PM Well Yeah I uh its Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah for the soccer uh Well uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights and there are a lot of flights in one page so if if th Yeah but True ID I dont know what you th guys think ME Might be ME Might be ID Yeah but do you like to have a such a s stop button ID Or do you think it uh I think its a kind of uh uh very rare and special function ID Yeah ID Okay it goes Yeah but thats kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now ID Thats why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements UI If you have seven pages you can go up and down ID Well yeah uh lots of new televisions can store pages you know and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it UI Yes ID Then we meet uh the new requirements ID we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design I guess PM A simple yeah ID Okay ID Um well what functions do we have to decide on ID Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want ID We have the zap and uh the volume ID Should we do m make them very big ID The the the zap button ID D d Th thats thats thats considered to be trendy also ME I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present yep UI Yes PM But trendy yeah PM I dont know ID Or maybe you should place them on a uh in a special way UI Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick ID Yeah something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah and quick PM Original ID You have to use it very quickly PM It was uh True ME Yep ME If you grab the remote your hands should be on top of the plus ID Yeah and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace ME Yes ID Oh what should we decide on then ID I think in a in a case of this simple remote control the technical aspects which uh werent worked out already but it w shouldnt be a problem then UI But No its o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest PM Yeah ID Yep PM Maybe uh Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe ID No okay but we dont have to uh when we dont want to uh control other devices I think it makes it even more simple UI No PM If you use large batteries or small batter batteries UI The most standard batteries ID I think I think that we should use uh d yeah not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well it has to be simple and I wi Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house you know ME I think double A PM Yeah ME Yep PM Yeah ME The most ordinary uh batteries PM Okay ME Yep ID Oh ID How much time do we ha we have left uh ID M m m more than thirty minutes ME I think about twenty minutes ID Uh ten twenty minutes UI But i in a way we have to be uh uh special ID Well uh these these shouldnt Yeah PM Early break ID Yeah okay ID But thats thats Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ID How we can what the extra touch can be UI Maybe th m For the remote control ID Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well it was something about how we lose them ID Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing ME I think thats n thats more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever PM To find him ID Yeah PM Thats maybe yeah ID I dont know ID I dont know ID Nah um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things ID It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone and it is i has something nice ME Yeah yeah thats good one yep PM Yeah ID Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener ID Maybe it contains some feature that you dont normally link to a remote control ID I think its very impor because were gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special PM Yeah ID Its gonna cost twenty five Euros ME Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually because television and beer is not a rare combination ID Yeah but the well its already been done PM Yeah but thats yeah ID Nah ID Yeah thats true ID But and I think its gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something ME Yes ID it has to be used something special and you really it has to you know y not s people when they buy it they have to think well this one lasts for a long time PM Yeah ME Yep ID Were really gonna use them ID Not some thing you you throw away next week you know ME No thats true ID So maybe uh thats i I think thats when uh when we decide on these type of functions know basic functions uh its very important to find something like this ID So theres a very important task for you ID And maybe we can all think about it PM Be original yeah ID Uh also for you maybe when t you its very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well you know PM Mmhmm PM And use friendly yeah ID So big buttons flashy design and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing PM Yeah ME Yeah PM Must brainstorm ID Uhhuh ME Yeah a swapable front or whatever ID Yeah or just different colours would be uh I dont know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control PM Well Why not ID It could be be Yeah you never know but But it and I think we have to make it quite big ME Yeah PM More money for us PM Yeah PM Quite big ME Yes definitely definitely PM Yeah you think ID Yeah people So and and also because uh it is expensive UI Thats to be uh a formed for your hand ID If you want it to be something you know its ha doesnt have much functions want to be you dont want to get it l make it Mmhmm ME Yes it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room ME As I uh as I said during my presentation fifty percent uh o Yeah ID And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table ID I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah that it it it it stands up PM A standard or something ID Yeah you have to put it on its So its like a vase or uh something you put on a table ME A face ME Or uh yeah yeah ID no no put stuff inside it ME Yeah UI More like a joystick then ID But its like like a statue or something Yeah yeah but yeah but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That its its fashionable ME Yeah yeah I see what you mean yep PM Its like you have uh four phones PM Something like that ME If you do that but I dont know if thats possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros ID I I dont Oh yeah ME I in in the base we could like make uh a button and if you push it the remote control itself s makes noise ME Thats probably stupid but uh as I found here uh fifty percent was it fifty UI But thats thats fun for the first time and then the second Or you can Yeah ME Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control ID Yeah but but when you when it gets lost how can you press the button to make it Oh okay ME No uh of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in PM On the television PM Oh like this ID Uh thats kind of nice ME If an a button in in that uh Yeah you can ma make rechargeable one yeah ID And then also you dont even need batteries because you can make it uh chargeable PM A char chargeable PM Yeah ID Yeah that w yeah but yeah the pro No well I think that it might be t p Well nee but we dont Yeah ME Why not PM Why not ID Maybe you but we dont know much about production cost but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and its a basic remote control then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know rechargeable units UI With recharger ME It should only cost twelve and a half Euros of course ME Aye ID Yeah but we would d ma wed do it in Taiwan and So its not gonna be that expen Uh I I think its a great idea PM Production ME Yeah okay PM It should be possible PM I think its a good idea ME Yeah ID S some kind of be Ive never seen that before and you make it uh um be uh you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays PM To make a base or something ME Yes ME Yes definitely ME Yeah UI Yes but is that handy ID Well I well its really ch you can recharge it so you ha never have the battery problem PM Its its its its its not the purpose to be handy its Mm ID Thats one ID And uh you can always find your remote control up Uh okay UI But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years three years with with t two batteries ID Well maybe yeah you could when thats when its too costly you could probably skip the recharger but you will you do need uh also an uh also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well you know UI And then you Yes ID Does it makes it kinda Yeah yeah ME Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts of course UI Or But you pay for it ME I dont know ID Okay PM Yeah but thats not its ugly I think ID Yeah ID Yeah but then its very easy to make it also a rechargeab I dont think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it PM No ME On the other hand if you dont do it we can also make a nice bay ME I mean it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it but um I think the bay is definitely uh Sure why not ID Yeah ID I think its a good idea ID And make it you know we we um Well we uh its it isnt a t a most uh costly uh remote control ID We can save on the on the functions ID We just put some simple button in make it big and sturdy nothing more and just make s sure theres some noise that it can make or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up its also nice ME Yep ID And if you put it away I think its uh w we have to we uh thats uh its not a easy market ME Yeah PM Yeah ID We have to something special ME Yeah ID And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control and we cant deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions because we arent gonna put Yeah PM True PM Yeah ME Definitely ME With eye candy ear candy whatever ME Yeah definitely ID And then uh when make it you know nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the standup thing ID Yeah ID I think I think its a good idea ME Yeah PM Yeah it must be must be a gadget to have ID Yeah ME Definitely yeah ID Oh if it lets well we will see whats possible concerning the the costs and if its possible well do that PM Yeah ID And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing ID And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something ID If thats too expensive we wont do that PM Yeah we c Or just give a beep when the batterys out or uh down ID But it would be nice ME It would be nice yes ID Its the idea ID I know that batteries last long nowadays ID And and what people just think about well Ill never have to buy any r batteries again so y b because its very annoying when your battery is empty ID And you know then when you havent batteries around and probably for two weeks your remo Ive experienced that that Yeah okay ME Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty so yes ID So easy functions ID Well we will we will I think well work that out zapping numbers on it bi Yeah ME Yeah why not ID But its also annoying ID cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working youre not very motivated to do something about it ME Hmm PM Yeah PM true ID Then it beeps all the time and ME No thats true ID You dont want to have ever have those problems and you wont have if if you have the rechargeable ID And you dont have to use the unit you can also put it on the side if people dont like it ID Uh i i in the in the ma Yeah but it w I mean if if they pay for it because they think oh thats a great idea Im gonna use it ME Why not ID And when it you know when time goes by and they think well Ill never put him in the recharger I think last long enough then they put it on side and they can use it now and then ID Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they theyre seeking for the remote control they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh I think its brilliant PM Yeah ME Bleep bleep bleep oh there it is yeah ID Yeah Ive never its so simple but Ive never seen it PM Yeah ME Yeah ME No PM And you can leave it just there ME Nearly ID M maybe we should really do this PM Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay now well how much time have we got left ID These clocks arent uh synched PM Yes ID Oh now Ive put uh well it is twenty p Okay so we have ten minutes or something PM Yeah Ill Uh fifteen minutes ME Something like that yeah ID Yeah but were uh were done ID I think ID Weve decided on the functions ID Well there is some oh ID There is a closing sheet ID We have lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work ME Oh ID Oh okay Ill make sure Ill I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes the the s the next minutes wont be a problem but Ill try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too but maybe it wont work but youll see ID I think these are more important than the first ones so ME Well see PM Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe PM That not not everything in one one uh folder ME Maarten five minutes ID Oh five minutes ID Yeah because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy you know ID Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout which I could uh know use for the other ones well but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one and when you go write a second uh its get its not working when you try to write second uh paper or something PM Yeah PM Maybe ME No thats true uh yeah ID And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I dont know ID Becau I d uh it was not my uh pen ME Should we by the way draw um on our nice whiteboard um a little uh idea of yeah ID this kind of looks you like ID Of the shape PM Or the sh Do you get an idea of the shape ID Yeah probably it would be nice ME I dunno ME Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ME I dont for one UI Maybe like this pen ME A bit bigger I guess but The shape is nice its um something different and we want we want that ID No bigger PM A little bit bigger yeah but Oh uh look uh look at the pictures UI It has to feel nice in your hand ID Well I I I have to say I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all or I think some maybe we should no that will be too costly ME Yeah ID We shou we could also that was a would also be an idea but I dont think it I dont know if it exists already you should like make Alessi or something design it ME Okay yeah ID That would also be nice ID But thats gonna then you c then you dont Yeah but then you dont have t yeah it thats not something i thats in the production cost a one its a one time you know s was its a single cost ME Yeah but twelve and a half Euros ME Uh Yeah ID Yeah m but but then you can nah I dont thin I think that it would be more expensive because Ive bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive ME Yeah thats true ID Would be a nice idea though ID I dont know ID I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something ID Like something like that or so or so And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it ME Something like that is very ergonomic ME So Yeah ID Its also round ID Put it in there uh wire on it ID Maybe uh I dont know some some lights a big but well PM Yeah flash lights at the side ID Volume and programme yeah PM At the side or something like that ME Yes volume and programme should be there I guess because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part ID And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here PM Yeah ME Yeah and the numbers on top I guess ID Numbers PM Yeah ID And and lights ID How were g well maybe uh s a ring of no no you have to Maybe on the side of it ME Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry PM Yeah side of it ID Along the side uh strip of yeah PM Just two LEDs or something on the side ME Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons PM Yeah ID Yeah but I also meant the the blinking li w you know the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote ME Oh ME Okay PM Yeah ME Yeah ID Well theys have to be Yeah PM Well uh probably at the side PM You know look at the front but Yeah exactly and then there is yeah ID Yeah yeah ID Exactly ID When you you see it from the side then it would look just like that ID And then you have a strip of uh lights or something PM Yeah something like that yeah ME Okay yeah ID Well uh I think its nice for one thing ID maybe put something on top of it or you know like thats looks funny PM No ID I dont know PM No ID Or some bump ME I think I think thatll be too big tha too big then ID Maybe some Yeah PM Bumper or something ID Well have to think about it ID I think were were done ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Yes we are ID We can save this one PM Lunch break ME Alright ME Yes I guess its lunch time PM Okay then ID Mm mm ME I dont know ME Half and hour ME I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour PM Okay five uh Oh ID Yeah that was what uh Mm well hear about it ME I dont know about the lunch break,"The project manager opened the meeting. The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function. The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost."
ID Okay all set ID Welcome to the conceptual design meeting PM Uh okay UI Yes ID The agenda ID The opening ID Ill again be the secretary and make minutes take minutes uh and it will be three presentations just like the last meeting ID So um who wants to start off ID Technical uh designer again PM Again ID Okay PM Hmm ID Uh yeah ID Uh before we begin it I want to say Ive Ive put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder but theyre still not uh quite okay ID It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other PM Mmhmm ME Okay ID So But uh from now on I wont use my pen anymore so will be p just ordinary keyboard PM Uh may be better yeah ME Keyboard work ID I think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Alright UI Okay when we talk about uh components design um its really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of UI Um a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material UI We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls UI Um the components of a remote control are of course uh the case UI Uh the properties of the case um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah it feels uh good in your hand UI Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too and the material is soft rubber UI Uh Ive got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction UI Um uh theyre telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too UI Mm Its okay UI Yeah UI I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case we must use a rubber pushbuttons to uh the the rubber doublecurved case is a is a t uh threedimensional uh curve in the in the design which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy UI Uh Um the energy source uh Ive got a lot of possibilities for that too PM Oh UI Um uh the basic battery which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh nondepending of of of uh um Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah kinetic uh energy UI Also in uh this one like in the watches but a remote control can lie on a table for a day and then you push uh a button and so you dont have to uh walk with it all the all the time UI Mm solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls UI Um uh also the case material uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird PM Oh titanium is probably trendy I think ME Thats true I guess ME Yeah PM Well maybe a little bit expensive PM I dont know ME Huh UI Uh they dont tell anything about the cost of uh titanium UI Um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf UI Also the speaker in the remote control when we want to retrieve it UI Um the base station is also off the shelf all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory UI Mm Ive told about uh the three first points UI Mm the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter UI Uh its all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company UI Um another possibility UI I uh yeah I looked up on was uh the LCD displays UI Could be uh something special to our uh remote control and its possible but it only cost a bit more but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros ID Twelve and a half UI Ah yeah ID Actually What are those t tooth uh brushes or so But its actually kind of uh well it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design ME Yeah PM Yeah production cost UI I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one UI You see uh a covers which can be Um I dont know UI Um Yes PM I Different colours also ME Yep UI Yes maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls ID And we can we can steal their ideas UI Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh uh house uh stuff ID Huh ID Well its a possibility too UI Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style but Yes because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it ID Uhuh ME Yeah thatll be for the future I guess ID Okay ID Next time were here ME Yeah PM Yeah ID Oh okay ME Yeah ME Definitely ID Okay UI Thank you ME Alright PM Okay PM uh Ah ME Yeah ME Thats okay PM Well I shall go to the next slide PM Um um I still dont have any information about user requirements PM I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh Yeah but but then wh I dont know when there are new user requirements ID Oh we decided upon that in the last meeting ID Didnt we ID Oh okay PM I ha I ha I have the I have nothing ID Well tha I didnt receive any new requirements or somethi Just no but we decided to use only b basic functions only PM Well I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of ID Okay PM I dunno if theyre maybe a little bit more but Yeah ID Well we maybe we can think of that later ID W just these are the ones you already summed up in the Okay PM Yeah I I uh well I pointed them out here just to make it a little bit easier PM Um Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side PM Um I dont know what costs of it PM Uh Ive no idea about it PM Uh I was also looking for what you said for I got an email uh uh about uh LCD in in in front of the remote control PM I dont know if thats a good idea or maybe its a little bit too much for twelve and a half PM Production ID Yeah UI Uhhuh PM If we got already uh something like a base ID That might get redundant also maybe ID I dont know what kind of information it would Yeah PM Yeah I dont know PM I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it ME Mm yeah PM Then I got a popups to go to the meeting ID Yeah its okay UI Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control PM But The remote control PM a little uh too A little bit A little bit too big I think ME Then you and then youve got a flag s Very big RC ID Okay ID Thats not It was not a good idea ME Yeah PM Exactly ID Okay PM Um yeah PM Well the functions are are not more to discuss I think ID No PM Its its just the base things we already discussed that the no VCR or that kind of uh so thats very easy ID No ME No PM Um Mmhmm ID But you do mention the next and previous uh button ME Next channel previous channel PM Well thats next channel ID Oh okay o okay okay PM I mean next channel PM Uh Um oh I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base ID Huh PM So its uh just an idea PM And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and Im not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small Well Im not a e Im the expert for userfriendly but not for trendiness UI But youre the expert ME I think it depends on the function ID Mmhmm PM Maybe it Well uh okay thats your point ME Well if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons arent userfriendly then we wouldnt im implement that of course PM Um yeah PM Yeah okay PM Yeah Ive nothing to s Uh with a little bit larger yeah ID Well w when we only use basic functions we have the possibility to make the buttons larger ME Oh thats right ME Yeah PM I thought so but maybe with the Yeah that groups ID Well I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons th th those two have yeah they have to be large ID Uh I mean th th the the two two basic buttons you know the to skip channels and to uh I think yeah I dont know why but I think that is thats t trendy too because thats the mo it it you know its uh acc acc um accentu uh how do you say it PM Large PM Yeah ME Yep PM Most the most used uh buttons ME Those are probably the the th Yes ID It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big like t Yeah PM True PM Yeah ME Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control UI You did the research ID And you want to acc accentuate that you know PM Yeah ME Sorry UI Its from your research ME Yeah sure PM Okay ID So Okay PM Uh that was all y uh personal preference I didnt have PM I didnt had any time left PM So Yeah ID No uh thats coo its cool ME You dont care ME No sorry ME Yeah ME Oh ME Go away ME Come on PM Its there PM Yeah click on it PM Couple time ME Oh great ME Well Ive done some research again about trends on the internet ME Um Ive done some investigation and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan ME Some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control ME Uh well we were going to imply that so thats nice ME The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the RC ME Uh our market really likes really likes that ME And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance the third point is a high ease of use ME And uh well for the idea Ive put some trends uh for the market of elderly people ME Dark colours simple recognisable shapes ME So we probably wont do that ME The younger market likes uh Well the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material ME I found this image which is uh Well it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables ME I dont see the spongy part in it ME But with a little bit of fancy Exactly ID Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then ME I got some ideas Uh well yeah pictures isnt really good word but um some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe ME Uh catchy colours ME Fruit is uh yellow green red whatever ME So remote controls in in catchy colours ID It doesnt stroke with the with the dark colours ME Uh no we dont want dark colours ID Not the dark colours ID Okay ME No I just put them there to uh yeah uh for general idea ID Okay ME And uh the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself ME But to Yeah the To implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the in the docking station ME At the bottom of the docking station or whatever ME And uh we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say ID For diversity or something ME Yeah also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour ID Uh No but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit PM Well how uh But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christs sake with remote control ME I mean it it it reaches a different market uh but it it it doesnt cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black RC on the market or whatever ME Yes ME Yeah theres theres always a Well there theres always empty space of course on a remote control PM Uh make it a banana ID Its like a pear or something ME I mean I think this part of the RC uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons I guess ID No I dont think you have to do it like Yeah but it that doesnt have to remind you you know like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit but just you know like the the the the round curves ME So you you can put some fruity things No of course not ID And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something ME Especially i Yeah yeah PM Yeah but th yeah but that Yeah but thats Yeah uh uh But d dont we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ME Yeah exactly ME If we make it little bit greenish ID Yeah ID You do get the idea eh ID The fruity kind of round Kay ME A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ID Yeah uh yeah I dont know UI Grapes ME Uh Isnt Wha whatever ID Uh this is a b yeah ID Yeah yeah ID Of course we have uh we have a very big uh the s Of d design team yeah ME Yeah sure ME Yeah ME Well w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things UI For a big team of artists ME This is then the uh pear ME I dont know the English word so forget it ID Yeah but Its pear I guess ME And um maybe yeah a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control but m yeah UI But uh but I think we dont have to make we cant make all uh ten designs ID No UI We have to make one design I th I I think ID No but I think its its already what we were were up to ME Mayb maybe two or three PM Yeah ID Uh its it doesnt have to resemble uh what I already said a specific piece of fruit but just you know like a fruity thing going on ME Yeah ME No sure but but B but thats great and and and what I was what what I was saying the catchy colours Yeah ID And its it looks fruity to me ID And uh but I do like the yeah I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too UI But pictures of fruit vegetables vegetables Yes you can put a logo on top of it ID Maybe its too much you know PM But we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours our own uh colours has to be in it ME Yeah uh not really ME Pictures was a was a bad word but Well we c yeah ID Okay but what are the This is yellow PM Yellow a Real Reaction ME Yeah sure ID But I dont think our our company colours are this fashionable PM Uh yeah ME Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here UI Yes its really fruity PM We uh f A yellow do Uh yeah ME I cant draw with this thing but Ill try ME If this is our docking station we can make our logo over here ME It doesnt work ME And then Well the button button over here or whatever I dont know PM Yeah and the button then UI With a strawberry on top ID Yeah on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do Okay PM Okay yeah ME On the front of course because else you cant find it PM Okay ME Well that were my ideas a little bit ME Ill close em down ME Um go away ID Okay you can you open the conceptual design presentation ME Conceptual design yes ID See what was on the agenda PM Lazy ME The agenda ID This is his own remote ID Because um maybe we can start with the technical uh functions but I dont think its there uh yeah um do we want to um use an LCD display for example PM Yeah ME Well its nice of course UI Only if we Maybe maybe we can make a TV guide on it for the channel youre on ME But I dont I dont know what to display on it ME I mean Yeah but it should be li like this big and I dont think Yes sure but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large LCD screen because Yeah I dont know ID Me neither ID Yeah but its so I dont think we should do it UI No no only the TV channel with the with uh with uh four programmes UI You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button UI Yes it can On your No on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also UI So why not on your remote ID Yeah but no ID I do I think its a bit redundant actually ID And its also not I dont th even think it it looks s like sexy or something its But youre already watching the TV youre not gonna watch your remote control PM Well well what would you display on it then UI Uh programme uh information or or or or g or a guide on t on teletext yes ME Programme information PM But is it isnt that a already on TV a lot of new TVs ME But Well a lot a lot of TVs indeed show uh when you uh zap to a But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of TVs which we were planning to but whatever UI Also on the internet UI But Yes but you also want to know whats next PM Yeah PM Yeah and we also have to yeah ME Because the TV has to send information back to the RC and I dont know if thats possible UI Yes thats uh really possible ME Yes yes o of course its possible but you gotta uh implement it in the TVs and I dont think everyones gonna buy a Real Reaction TV within a month after the release of our uh remote control PM And I also Yeah I dunno ID I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an LCD in it but I I really dont think its a good n goo because it also doesnt stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials uh its a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it ID It was our idea you know to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it ME Yeah ID But I dont think a LCD display fits in that image ID You know its like more vulnerable and it adds nothing really you know ME Thats true thats true it breaks f yeah it it its not very solid its uh frag fragile ID Yeah yeah ID You could make it but its just it it doesnt I dont think it its coherent with the design were after ME No ME No ME I dont think so ei either ID But thats my opinion ID Well you you y Okay we can vote for it ID You want the LCD display UI No ID I dont want to and he doesnt so its up to him ID If we wanna And Ive read somewhere that Ive got some kind of veto veto uh rights ME Ah PM Oh okay ME Bastard ID So I can also say But did we skip the Yeah you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should Were not even sure what what information we want to display on it PM We can you away PM Yeah I dont know PM Uh uh I i if its its a simple p No that thats right and uh I also have to think about new functions maybe buttons or something like that to control it UI No uh um Y yes you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions ID So Nah thats not gonna work PM Kind of LCD or something or But how does it display then ME Yeah I guess PM W when I go to the second channel what what does it show me UI Uh then you push a button UI The title and the information about the programme PM About that programme UI But but uh yeah what he said was right about the televisions they have to be uh customised to the But maybe in future it will be a giant hit and when you are the first you have the biggest uh Yes you can put uh a little LCD display on it with uh with lots of information ME No ID Yeah ID Oh well uh Ive seen it done before ID Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes they have d LCD displays but then its very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling PM Yeah ID So its that thats what Ive seen ME Yeah thats true if you uh Yeah ID But it just it j it doesnt doesnt match with the our whole basic concept UI But uh I havent thought about it UI But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it it i it isnt vulnerable ID Well yeah yeah okay UI You can throw with it and When when you put uh maybe a colour LCD t uh screen on it its very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from But uh Ive got a the email with uh with the possibilities ID Thats maybe not the most important but its just I dont think so PM Is it fashion PM I dont know PM Thats not up to you PM Thats up to market if i if its trendy ID Yeah well do you ha do you have to You havent looked after the trendiness of LCD displays have you ME No PM Because our our motto is we put fashion Yeah if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured ME Well I think its uh I think its pretty trendy to be honest uh but um I dont know if if if well Im coming back to the costs again but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits ME And I think uh especially colour LCD which is indeed pretty trendy ME But I dont think Uh I think it will be too expensive UI And LCD was a possibility for the remote control ID Yeah yeah yeah UI So why dont we use it ME Uh did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh LCD or uh coloured LCD ID Yeah but were gonna if it Then uh then you better dont yeah d Uh uh I really dont feel the whole idea of an LCD display PM Coloured If you have black and white or something or grey thats Its too much uh maybe uh with with the LCD and the docking station and With one thing special ME Yeah really if y if you c i I in in two thousand and four you cant uh put something on the market which is a monogramme ME Really UI No but it doesnt sa say anything about a colour or But mm I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it UI But I didnt think that Yes but o on the No when y But it look Yes but that remote controls are already on the market ID Im sorry ID It cant co you cannot convince me ID I dont know how well how to with you guys but I dont really feel it ID We already were uh Yeah we already have the the th th th base station gadgets and want and it uh uh do it has to be a simple design which sturdy which soft I dont think I j uh and really I dont see how the the LCD display is gonna add anything you know on a design level ME Yeah ME W weve weve gotta find a balance of course ME And I think We have a pear PM Not a whole package of specialty ID Uh I think its slicker to have no L CEDs ID Y we want to its simplicity w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons so you dont need an LCD ID It doesnt fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote UI The simple Yes but but when you want to have something special Yes but you had a picture of it from another company ID Yeah but we already have the docking station which is It has to be developed but no but it thats thats our thats our killer feature PM And uh the Yeah PM Its just an its just an idea ID Thats our what makes it special PM Its a its True UI Yes it was already made UI Tha the remote control on the docking station ID Yeah were gonna develop our own r n docking station ME Is that so ME Was it it wasnt just a prototype UI Yes he have a picture of it PM Well uh I uh Yeah I dunno ME Exactly Ive never seen it in a store ID Uh but re we really have to cut this off I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it you know the the LCD thing but I I think its its not a good idea and we have already mentioned all the arguments ID I dont uh do you guys agre How do you guys think ID I d Okay we s skip the LCD display PM No its too much ME I think its a little too much yeah PM Its overdone UI Okay ME Okay ID Im sorry maybe you can do something if we are at your own place or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something PM Democratically ME No UI Mayb I will rule the world with it ID But Probably so ME Yeah yeah yeah yeah ID Okay ID But for the technical part ID The m material I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber UI Yes maybe a bit of a cushion is Yes ID Uh Yeah yeah yeah p Exactly ID This is what it w Yeah but it it was already what were uh were after you know to give it uh you know the soft touch in your hands and also to know like Yeah that is y the b airbag kind of thing ME Yeah for the spongy uh feel PM With a spongy Bob feel ME Yeah PM Yeah UI Like a b yes ID You can st throw it at your little brothers head PM Yeah you just can drop it ME Yeah airbag PM Yeah ME If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ID No no no not that comfy UI Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see ID Yeah yeah ID Yeah ID Okay thats a thats a good point ID And thats why I like the dark t col dark colour bit you know because it may be the design uh its uh maybe it is a bit of the its a bit nineties maybe what were what were up to rat fun to this point ME Yeah PM But not black I think ME No PM Well if if its fruit and vegetables it have to be colourful ID Yeah thats thats true but but it has to be a little big solid ME Yeah b yeah thats what w I I was pointing at PM But can we ge uh uh Can we combine it or something ID It mustnt be too n you know th too overwhelming then when you put it on your just Yeah PM Uh with uh yellow and black ID Yeah maybe so PM Make it a bee ME What PM A bee ME Oh a bee ME Oh ID No uh I dont like the yellow and black combination ID But it is our company colours UI Yes real real good colours ID Apparently PM Yeah its our yeah PM We we have to use yellow ME Yeah ME Hmm UI Hmm ID I dont like yellow and uh maybe I dont know ME Well we can as as I draw really nicely over there UI But thats not really fruity ME We can put the logo on our uh on our base station ME Uh yeah ME And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself ID But Okay but what uh what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ME But i Yeah UI Uh fronts of the We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the telephone ID Should we do that ID I dont think you we should do that ID Maybe just bring it out in different colours but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards thats also too much PM Different fronts ME I guess thats thats enough ID People dont wanna spend more money on their remote control I guess ME Thats way too Nokia PM Yeah PM Uh you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants yeah UI Are these designs ID Yeah yeah ME Yeah definitely PM Yeah Three three or four uh four uh colours or something like that ME Just bring more designs on the market ID But uh without gon uh okay ME Why not yeah ID So are we through the technical part then UI Yes ID Okay ID So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well not u unanimously or how you call it but Yeah UI It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles PM Well yeah the Three to one PM Thats And tita uh titanium is uh is is it a no ID The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay UI Yes ID O o only only the last point your no titaniums not not out of question I guess UI Yes But also w Yes b bu but when we use s soft mm Mm PM Is Its just like that th this titanium ID But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium as well ME Sure ID Makes it in a homogeneous uh design PM No not all not all of them UI But it it then it uh you cant throw it it UI It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control ID It will it will break other stuff w when its plastic as well UI No uh titanium is a bit uh its a bit harder ID Yeah ME Yeah thats true ID No but uh uh you should ma Yeah UI But also on the colours the young Yes but a titanium remote control when youre uh watching TV uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty and the Yes ID Okay think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium ID Well would it be more trendy ID More chic ME Yeah I think it I think it does PM Uh I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic PM In trendy things ME Yeah o On the other hand if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh Yeah thats true thats true PM Yeah PM Its cold in the winter ID Yeah but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing PM Yeah ID But the question is i then its you know is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh know like uh When you make it titanium it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually dont need UI Sports and gaming UI Define ID And when its big and plastic its like some fun stuff you can always have around ID Its always fun to have something big and plastic around ME Yes PM You have that uh MP three player of Nike I saw ME Yeah PM Isnt that titanium with a little bit of rubber UI Yes its w but it is uh plastic PM Isnt it Is plastic PM Well its titanium looking UI Yes w we can do that on the on the We can make this as a style too ME What PM Yeah he is PM Here he is PM Uh the I dont know if you know the MP three player of Nike PM Kay uh that thats very uh with rubber so its very rough ME Oh yeah ME Okay yeah ID Yeah thats beautiful ME Yeah I see ME Yeah but but but Yeah I th I think thats difficult because uh thats different material and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of Yeah if its just a colour uh which you uh which you change then I guess its its nice to have one of these UI Uh this is uh just a No we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic ID Oh maybe th maybe this is an No I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it ME Uh Yeah UI Uh I dont have the information ID You know like the the soft stuff but I dont know if its possible UI Uh I I didnt got it Yes ID But you cant make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look PM True ID But make it just like shiny ME Mmhmm PM Yeah yeah true ID Maybe we should uh shou And uh and maybe we sh should we t I dont know if we should talk about uh how how much time have we got left UI Like the MP three player PM Yeah maybe thats good idea yeah PM But if you want to la uh yeah last longer than two weeks or something like that you can maybe I dont know ME Yeah UI Uh in a lot of other uh in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry PM What time does The rubber ID Forty minutes UI Uh they began with uh t typical uh leather bags but then they became stylish with all all si all sort of colours and w kind of fon of uh of fronts like we can use on the telephone and it Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and Yes and and styles ME Yeah ID Okay ID You putting in different colours ID Okay UI They have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it a and uh Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance but with new uh with new colours new yes ME Uh yeah yeah ID Okay ID Yeah but w yeah ID Well it is ID Its a possibility ID But lets think about the bas Mmhmm mmhmm ME Yes ME New prints on it ME Yep ID But wha th our basic idea y I mean you gonna were probably gonna have like two type of materials like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it ID And and pro and lights ID We have to incorporate the lights too ID But uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a twotone colour look like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ID Is that the idea ID Is that a good idea ME How do you mean ME Th th the uh base in a in another Yes ID How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna were uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left by the way ID How many colours are we gonna give it ID Like twotone colour UI There there are three uh components three components type ID T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons and the cushions as well should be in another colour PM Yeah PM Uh no not too much I think UI You have the buttons the the case uh itself and the rubber and th Yes ME How the buttons yeah PM Or you just make uh one colour uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh In in another colour ME Yeah ID Okay but not more than Well yeah its No PM Not more than two colours I think ME No definitely not PM Its a g a little bit too flashy ID Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting ME Yes definitely UI Yeah or or when you use the buttons as black it you can use two colours as well uh But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right Okay ID Okay ID But we have to uh think of some other uh important things ID Uh oh yeah the the functionalities of the the buttons PM The funct yeah I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea ID No ME No I think thats too vulnerable PM Yeah ID I think this is okay the so we have the basic ID Then we have the numbers ID We have the power button ID We have we have a teletext button PM The volume teletext and Yeah yeah yeah yeah b Yeah but wha what kind of menu ID And maybe want to access a a menu or something ME Yeah but thats thats I was thinking thats gotta be on the television ID Most TVs have a menu ID Yeah but I think you ha I really need a menu button ID Thats just i the only button only You know I No I think most TVs have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings PM Is uh isnt that different from every television ME Mm ME Yeah if its c if Yeah I think its okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the TV doesnt have a menu then Yeah ID And so But that that covers all the all the other settings ID It covers everything then ME Yeah you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever ID No you can use the And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that ID Th in that way we have like only the numbers the power button skip and volume and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah mute ME Mm yeah ME A mute and a teletext and a menu PM Mute ID A teletext and a menu and then then i thats it ME Thats all ID Its all we need PM Yeah ME Hmm ID Okay uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station ME Great ME Yeah PM Okay thats not mu not much functions PM So Okay ID Something important about a s uh no uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself I guess ME Yeah definitely ID Uh in one colour ME Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ID Just use I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions pads and things on the s uh side UI Uh What are we going to do now ME Yeah thats true thats true ID And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity you know ID Just round shapes with uh Yeah but were gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important because it has to be flashy but and but it d it doesnt have to be annoying that when you uh know some things is just over the top and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks you it just gets annoying because its so big and flashy ME Yeah its kinda fruity and with th with catchy colours uh uh w Yeah definitely ID Uh it has to be some level of subtlety but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that ME Yeah ID Okay ME Okay ID Guess were through then ME I guess so ID But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind ID I think thats uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um But our des design experts will uh work that out ME Yes PM Yeah PM Too much colour i it uh when you got it in a living room its too much maybe ME Yea yeah PM It has to be Yeah ID Okay well I think the meeting will be over within a minute ME Yep ID So we will wrap up ME Something like that ID Or is there anything wed like to discuss ME I guess not ID Thats right ID Okay ME Do you guys PM No ME No ID Okay ID Well you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably ME In the shared folder PM Oh okay yeah ID Yeah uh no for su for sure because Im will now type them out ID Uh y yeah ME Youll see in you email I guess PM Yeah ID I think uh But toilet paper roll and uh Okay ME Yeah I dont know ME I dont know PM I hope so PM And the other thing is that you dont have kind of prototype or something like that PM You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh Yeah UI I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes ME Construct one yeah PM With you laptop PM Yeah PM Oh my God ME Alright shall we get back to work ID Yep ME Great ID I was waiting for the l last message but Mm yeah PM Well you are ME Yeah PM Were not ME Bastard UI Back to the pen,"The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. A fancy look and feel is most important to users, followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo. The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it. The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting."
ID Okay welcome to the detailed design meeting ID Again Im gonna take minutes ID Oh were gonna have a prototype presentation first ID Uh whos gonna give the prototype presentation ID You two guys UI Yes ID Okay ID Go ahead PM coffee UI Kay weve made a prototype UI Um weve got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting UI Uh especially we looked at the form material and the colour UI Um weve uh drawn here the p prototype UI The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher UI Um our interface elements there are shown in the in the drawing UI Maybe you can uh point them uh The functions PM Uh well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious PM Uh its a little bit PM Uh power button PM Uh then the the the nine uh channels PM Uh the volume uh uh at the side and the other side is the programmes PM And then we had uh just uh two buttons we place them in the middle uh the menu and for the teletext I thought that was th Oh the mute button ID Oh no the the the mute button misses now ME Alright I Yeah ID Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button UI But uh that Its uh here then in the middle PM Yeah ME Alright and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button ID Huh UI Yes um weve disc Most of the users Yes y there there will be a p a little a little P on that and a little uh yeah PM Well yeah mo uh mo Yeah well most of them are righthanded ME Yeah but you you gotta make it clear on the on Yeah and a and a triangle on that PM Yeah well I dont have time in uh anymore on the Oh yeah just progr programme above I think ME Yes ME Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually ID Wait theres was one thing I wanted to ask ID Uh there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d I call it teens and twenties ID Uh y th th th the two numbers UI Yes ME All n no thats um kinda dependent on the television PM Yeah true yeah UI Its a television UI Yes ID Yeah but do we have do we need extra buttons for example some uh some have to Yeah but you dont you dont actually need them becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first then you have a couple of seconds No I dont think so PM Uh Uh I think so ME I think Yeah I think you should add A cross or whatever UI Yes yes you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes PM Zero PM May maybe here ME Yeah line PM Yeah PM And then a second ME No thats dependent on the television UI Yes you have televisions then you have to you know you have to uh press Yes but but a lot uh Yes but some televisions dont accept uh that that No no but s Yes but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button uh then you go to a a next level you can push two buttons ME I do know so PM Is it depending on television ID Nah I dont think so really because you have a I know some remote controls that dont have these buttons but you still can know obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten ME Yeah ME Yes but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television ME Or actually the other way around ME But Yeah ID No I think uh I really think its n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash its the same thing as when you just push the one because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply ME Yeah well but su If No no no ID Yeah because thats i its for television ID Its exact the same thing ME So some television respond differently ME Look if uh i i Yes ID No listen listen ID When you push the button the remote control gives a signal ID I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it ME Yes thats true ID The one with dash that signal gi and when y whe when you dont push another button on the remote control within five seconds then the remote control gives a signal for channel one PM Yeah PM True ME No No it it it works uh if you havent got uh a special button for it uh if you push a one then on your television there will appear a one and a a line which is an empty space ID I think it works that way really ID Yeah but its exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button ID Yeah but you dont underst uh you dont understand my point ME Yep ME True ID I think its exact the same thing when y No but then they would a would also support that button because its the same thing UI You want Yes but some television dont support it PM But the ex Yeah ID Listen with that thats that special but button youre talking about eh ID Thats just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv TV that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it ID When you dont have that separate button and you push y one its exactly the same thing ID Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had Yeah ME No s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No thats not true UI No a remote can Yes so they need no they need No but uh Yeah it And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input ID But you give the input ID You push the one ID Thats the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is ME Its simply not true ID Think about it ME Its simply not true PM You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash and then wait uh two uh seconds or something Well discuss them in the usability lab ME Uh No remote control doesnt give signal after five seconds ID And its the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one ME Remote control is a stupid thing ME If you push a button it sends it immediately to to the television ID Yeah thats true ID Yeah but I m uh but its I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesnt sport these buttons it still works ID But okay we well impl No well apply them then for now ME No definitely not ME Definitely not PM Uh eva evaluation PM I dont know uh I dont know if if its its necessary ID Yeah app just apply them next to the zero the one and the two PM Yeah ID Yeah I think so ID Yeah for now if we dont know for sure whether Yeah but okay PM Okay ME Yes PM Ach ME Uh you can access that uh via zero and then minus I guess ID What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal that that might not be true but I still think i it it all TVs in some ways support it I dont know ME Yeah PM Yeah UI No no ID I think its more c is m maybe we dont uh we both dont really understand how it i how it really works but I think theres more to in than wha than what you just said UI Uh remote control sends one signal at one button uh press ID I do think that uh m TVs support mur multiple kind of remote controls UI Uh some N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten No you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals ID M Th wont work wi with uh to have that special button UI When you uh press one button you give one signal UI And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher UI But When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals it could work but Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote ME Yep ID Okay well well see ME Okay ME I kinda miss the docking station PM Yeah UI Yes UI Its here on the We came uh Yes PM Well it yeah uh theres nothing I think its pretty basic the the theres no fu theres one theres one button thats wha theres theres theres one function and thats n the one button when you want to find it ME No nothing really trendy about it UI But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls ME The button ME Yep UI So maybe we can uh use the docking station for example uh MP three players or or uh uh hearing devices ME I think thats very difficult because of different shapes of uh uh devices UI Yes but when you put that same volt voltages on it you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it when its o the same as the other products you can put it all on the same uh Yes but we can make No we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same ME Yeah of course ME Mmhmm ME Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape of course ME The technology and the voltage can be the same ME Thats uh thats true ME But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this then they all fit ME Yeah thats true but uh Yes but uh I I g Shouldnt it fall then UI When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out we can place all on top of it UI Just have to be big enough for the biggest No when you make it large enough no it it will not ME It isnt going to fall down ME Thats a bit uh yeah I think No but if if like this Ill Ill point it out if you got uh a a a base a base like this I wont draw it really UI But then its a little bit But its just an idea ME If you got a base which is uh as big as this Yeah sure but if you got if you got a tiny player it can Yeah UI But its flat its flat as as this so we can p make all the products as flat as this PM You can PM But i i i its backwards UI Yes but when you make uh uh a bit of big Yes little holer littler Uh little products go deeper in it PM But its its backwards PM Its leaning PM Its leaning backwards I think in the in the docking station ME Uh wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh right help PM Thats text ID But Well lets ha lets talk about the docking station later because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway because we have some uh cost issues still to come ME Uh you could make like a hole in it you know of uh in in the Yeah ME That i that is possible yep ME Yeah sure youre right UI Yes UI And uh uh the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area ME Oh ID But we have to look n I dont know ME I dont like the colours ME Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button which is the most common used uh function and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb UI So its its its really good design ID Okay ME Yeah ID Yes ME Alright ID Thats it UI Yes uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it ME The light ME Okay ME And other lights ID I think added lights are gonna be a problem too UI Yes we can make also n neon lights on it or or the buttons that can make uh light on it ME No o on the on the front ME Yeah okay ME Maybe the uh the logo UI Yes PM lights UI But it will also uh uh use batteries and do we want to The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh Yes ME Yeah why not ME Of course ID Okay PM Mm ID For now uh this is uh is good enough ME Okay ID Yeah what was uh on the Okay but in the oh yeah the colour because were gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber isnt it ID Then were gonna do the buttons in the i are were gonna have rubber buttons ID And theyre be a theyll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side UI Yes PM Yeah ME Uh in the same colour as the side PM Yeah ME Yeah I think I think thatll be good ID Okay PM Yeah ID And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff Yeah well talk about the lights later PM Yeah UI Yes maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights so it will uh Yes ME Yes ID Cause I also don yeah its depends on the costs and such ME Yep ME Yeah ID But uh and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours but may I dunno if thats important but well talk about that later ID Okay for now this is this is okay ME We will ID Um the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ID Uh I have to see the agenda ME Well uh yeah I Im gonna do something right there yeah UI No ID Detail design ME We gotta do that on the right the most rightmost screen because the leftmost Yep thats me ID Evaluation criteria ID Okay PM Okay ME Alright ME I will be needing that image so leave it please ME Um Go away ME Right were gonna evaluate that design according to a few points ME Um we g the four of us are going to do that um together ME I wanna have a colour over here come on ME Right the remote is not ugly a bit weird sentence but the positive things has to be on the left so I said not ugly instead of ugly ME Uh what would you say we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design and please forget the drawing skills of these guys ID Okay ME The remote control is not ugly ME How do you feel ID Yeah I think four maybe would be appropriate because its Yeah maybe it really depends on taste ID Uh I mean its kind of our design ID Its so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly you know o other people find it really cool ME Yes UI Yeah ME Background colour ID I dont know or uh I dont know how you Casting ME How do you guys feel UI I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side because you can uh make it in your own yes you can make it in your own uh more to your own personality or or house style ID Yeah ME The different designs ME Yes PM Yeah ME Okay ID Yeah but we d we didnt were were not planning to use fronts I believe ME No not not fronts but different designs ID With a colour a co a colours PM No not fronts PM Different designs UI Yes ID Oh okay ME And thats still uh uh yeah is is uh is a little personal touch I guess PM Different colours maybe yeah ID Okay but Oh maybe we should do three or something that w you know our Yeah ME What ME Yeah wha wha what would you uh guys uh think UI Or forty ME Personally ME Personally PM We can make it a one ME Yes but what is it UI I think two or three PM Mm yeah ME Guido PM I agree ME Two or three PM Um I uh I go for the positive ME I was I was thinking about three so I guess three is uh a bit uh oh what am I doing PM So I go for two ID Uh I was thinking about four so I think three is uh Yeah well let that lets make that a one PM Okay three ME Ill mark it ME The remote controls uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy PM Yeah UI Yes PM Two ME Yeah PM One PM One ME Antek you agree UI Yes PM Okay yeah Ill Ill agree UI Yes ME Yeah ID Thats one thing for sure ME Youre not Antek PM Im the Im the usability so Yeah ME I totally agree ME The remote control the remote controls relevant buttons are prominently visible UI Yes ID Yeah two or a one I guess PM The Well Yeah well menu Yeah maybe ID Its something we really put work into ME Yeah I yeah ME I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant UI Its all about the buttons ME And our oh yeah its a b yeah ME Yeah ME Alright ME Thats a one ME You agree ID Yeah ME The remote control hasnt got too much redundant or unneeded buttons ME I think we totally succeeded there ID But Well maybe a two because of the menu button or something ME Oh Yeah thats true ID And telete Yeah we dont know if the uh theyre necessary ME Thats true UI Also the the the buttons of the one the two the the digits o theyre used uh uh Can yes three two ME the the yeah m well you d youve got a point ID I think a two PM Yeah true PM Yeah I agree ID Came a long way but not we didnt not uh No w w it can also always be more simplistic but two is yeah ME Two or three PM Mm two ME Two UI But you cant make a remote control without them because Yes ME Antek PM Because we got Well ME Nay that that thats true thats true ME Theyre definitely needed ME So we put it on a two ME The remote control has got a really trendy look UI Yes UI A one ME Maarten ID Yeah uh a t I think a two ID Yeah yeah y i its hard to say from this picture ME Yeah UI We weve tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever PM Yeah ME Ever yeah ME Guido ID But I do think its more But I do think that its more trendy than beautiful PM Uh I will I will make it a three because uh yeah PM I I th Yeah ME Yeah uh I agree UI Yes ME I agree ID So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the A th a three PM True yeah ME I was planning to give it a two uh where I give the not ugly uh oh yeah thats true ME You agree on the two PM Yeah UI Yes ID I i uh when you compare to the Uh uh whats the difference with Okay ME Great ME Remote control hasnt got too much redundant or unneeded buttons ME Uh I copied that one ME Well uh forget that ME Um Go away ME Remote control has got innovative technology implanted PM No UI No ID No PM Were not well maybe the the the on the side UI No not LCD so ID Yeah but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ME Yeah and the light ID Yeah but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh PM And the light maybe UI But that thats not innovative PM But Well six ID And I dont u also its also really not innovative its more No six ME Well I g Its not seven UI Lights lights are Six ID Or seven maybe yeah PM No six ID Or six ME Why uh why not a seven PM Six ID Yeah mine is seven UI Because weve tried to make it a little bit innovative but it but it With the lights it its its kind of future But still you can retrieve it when its when its gone with the with Yes PM Yeah ME How ID Uh its uh depends on the on the maybe No I think I think actually its a seven maybe but theres nothing innovative about it ME Yeah you think the lights are innovative ME Well its n true ME Uh I agree m but Ill Yeah you you didnt draw the docking station PM Innovative in generally or just f original for A docking station is innova Okay ID N no no t ME Yeah it its I think I think with its I think more m Uh that thats n No uh well the agenda says evaluate now so I think we Its its a six UI The docking station is a is a little bit innovative ID Yeah I mean the dock station but but uh I think the the docking station its gonna be a kind of a problem UI Its a part of the remote UI And with the speaker on the theres also a speaker ID But Well lets leave it open for uh for us later to see what because we have to reevaluate anyway ID Well I i yeah UI Okay ID No ID Okay for now its a six or a seven uh sev six maybe because Yeah but I dont I dont know if its very inno yeah PM Six UI But the retrieval or the Yes how would you innovate a remote control more ME That m f Yeah for the retrieval function ME Yeah ME I think thats very innovative for a remote control ID Yeah v Yeah more through uh like function TV functionalities and no no you know what I mean UI To put it on your head ID You have must be innovative technology for remote controls but more in how you control stuff not in how you find your yeah ME Yeah sure but But I d I definitely dont think its a five but Remote control is easy to use ID Yeah its thats thats think about it la later on and uh Yeah as a a one or a two ma uh at least UI Yes PM Yeah a two UI Yes ME I think a two ME Yeah ID Yeah its good PM More two ME Come on ME The remote control hasnt got uh ID No I would have seen that one before ID Oh you skipped one uh Uh here ME Ive just filled uh Go away UI You like the buttons ME I found twelve questions so much but it still is ten ID Remote control will be bought by Yeah ME It will be bought by people under the age of forty UI Yes PM Yes ID Definitely UI In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ID Well Uh just in general ME No no no ME No just if they if they buy it ID Yeah a two UI We dont know ID Yeah but I think I think two UI But Yes two but only in c when you compare it with with elderly ME Yeah what do you think PM Yeah I think two yeah PM I agree ME Antek PM Two ID Uh that is not the question ME No thats no comparison ID Its just w it will be bought by people under forty ID Yeah you can yeah you can be very picky about it ME And I dont mean two people UI This is just guessing ID Ah yeah just make it well make it a two UI Make it a two ME W w Right the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image colour logo or slogan UI When it succeeds uh it can get a two mu A logo ID Oh no ID Yeah ID Yeah you have make an slogan is quite obvious PM We dont have the slogan though ME Oh the slogan ID Oh the oh sorry no not not the slogan ME Can we see the slogan PM The logo ID Yeah you can put that on the side if if we would like to PM Underneath it or something UI Yes uh encrypted uh with Yes ID Yeah and I will I th still think its gonna be a two or a three ME Are we gonna do that PM A three ID Maybe a three this time PM Three PM Yeah a three ME Three ME I agree ME Because of the slogan Remote controls got a basic design intended uh for novice users ID And uh Uh its a one or a two PM Yeah two UI Yes ME Two ID Yeah make it a two PM Two ME Two ME Alright ME We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average ME Four five seven nine ME Forget that ME Fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six ME Twenty six ME Its a two point six ID Its not that bad ME Alright we yeah ID Yeah and thats mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology we would score two which is uh quite a great score ME Yeah ME True ID Okay ID Uh this is was uh the evaluation ME This was my evaluation ID Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has Yeah ME So We did a pretty nice job until now ME Um is this your Whatever UI Is there something after this uh meeting ME Well I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire UI Or Okay PM No PM Okay yeah ID Still opened or uh Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay finance ID Because um I received uh a spreadsheet PM Shoot ME A five ME A five ID Yeah but I uh actually dont need this presentation I guess ID Oh ME Doesnt matter ID Im gonna open the spreadsheet and were gonna work this out together because I didnt really fin uh I have a ID Didnt really finish it ID Well we uh Well see ID Well stumble upon some problems ME We probably will ID I probably have already opened it here ID try it again ID First of all the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list ID But lets lets st start with beginning ID We include one battery ID I i uh Ill explain its Uh the the components are listed over here ID Uh price is given ID We um yeah we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component how much we need of them ME The amount yeah ID And then uh well uh calcula Dont watch the number yet ID I dont know if its filled in properly ID Okay we need one battery ID One battery ID I think one battery is enough UI Yes ID We dont need kinetic solar cells hand dynamo ID A s okay this this is a p first problem ID Uh I think we should know how many simple chips regular chips Okay UI Uh its its one one chip but but you have to choose one from it ID But Where did we find this information UI The simple chip is e enough I I think but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval it can be uh No uh I Yes my my my uh The the email I got said uh simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device it will uh cost a a bit more like I think the advanced chip maybe ME I dont know I havent got an idea on on which we need to use really ID Was it I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh f your first presentation to make this clear but then you had some t time problems PM No ME Yeah ID But do you th you do you know what chip we need ME Yeah ME And how do you know ME I mean you got that email UI Bec No the they didnt know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it ME Did it point out what to use them for ID Maybe you can uh look it up right now ID Okay but okay ID When we dont when we leave the uh retriever and such aside what then it would be a simple chip UI Then its a simple chip ID And with the retriever it would be an advanced chip UI Yes I I I s I That will be enough for future uh recommendations ME Alright well point out the advanced chip for now I guess ID Okay ID Yeah but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems ID The sample sensor sample speaker ID What is it m is that the speaker we were t I dont know what it is UI I dont know it uh either ME I dont know ID Okay we went for the doublecurved case made out of plastic and rubber UI Yes ID And with a special colour ID I guess thats what we were Yeah I dont know about the special colour but I think w uh Yeah I think we uh we have special colours PM Well special colour UI Otherwise you get uh a standard uh plastic colour ME I dont know if its very special PM I dont Mm okay UI Standard rubber ME Alright thats okay ID Okay then the pushbutton I was just counting them UI St Yes ID Uh I think you have to indicate the amount of pushbuttons we want to use isnt it PM Whoa its a little Thats huge ID Well thats bit of a problem because I re but I really dont understand that because I can imagine a remote control with far more pushbuttons and it wouldnt be possible according to this uh sheet PM No PM We have the simplest buttons ME No UI No its only uh when you use pushbuttons it will cost that much ID Yeah ME I dont think so because it says amount UI If you use a scrollwheel Maybe its the kind of pushbuttons ID Ah ID Yeah it wouldnt Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I dont know ME The the the yellow row is the amount of To n thats total of four buttons ID I And I count them like this UI You can have f four kind of pushbuttons UI Rubber PM Uh one til nine UI You can have uh Different yes PM Is that one or is that nine buttons ID One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen PM Yeah ID Because Oh this is oh this is one okay ID Twelve okay then it would be eighteen because uh I uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons ID Yes ID And plus these two f uh plus the mute button and its will be uh eighteen ME I think that Eighteen ME One two three four five si Fifty cents for one single stupid button UI Why is that so uh expensive ID Yeah I dont understand ID Y I do I dont get the point because its would be s relatively so expensive just these m small buttons PM Is it cents the the the fifty cents a button UI So whe when you so then it Its eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of When you have the same amount of button you have to put in wi in your carton PM No way ID Well okay well well lets make it just one ID Here now its now its already s shall we just give our own interpretation to because else we would really have a problem ME Yeah exactly ME Yeah ID It would be impossible to make it And and less buttons than this isnt possible ME I cant I I I couldnt understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button PM Its way No no no ME Really UI Board ME Yeah yeah No really UI And then throw it But whe Ive seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah only with uh page up page down and volume but but Uh its its still for little children ID This is the most simple yeah it is possible but Ive never seen one before ID Yeah without the numbers ID Thats possible PM Yeah uh Thats still four ID Yeah we could skip the numbers ME Yeah but I d I wouldnt want to own that ME Really UI They can handle that remote control but but it isnt fo Yes its for its li uh its just for a little Otherwise it Otherwise it would be the Special form also it says ME Yeah ID Then uh teletext would also be im impossible PM Yeah thats no option thats no option ID Okay well well just okay ID But then still when we theres no room for a docking station or something ID Tha w Le lets see th we have uh oh yeah button supplements ID Well give the buttons special colour ID Well give them a special form ID Uh I think we should mark the special form thing because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons I guess PM A special colour why a special colour ID Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings PM But wha what s what special ID I think thats the what they mean by a special colour PM Okay yeah ME I dont think the special form is really true PM Uh yeah ID I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here because thats what we were planning to do making it Yeah special material r also because i has rubber ME Is it ID And the buttons have to be rubber UI What is the normal material ME Yeah I dunno PM Plastic UI Sh yeah PM Plastic I think UI Classic PM Plastic ME Plastic UI Oh plastic ID Kay but the problem now is that the Theres no such thing as a docking station in this list but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents PM Yeah UI But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes ID Separately PM Se no no no UI And and but we dont have to tell it but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station ID Yeah yeah ID Yeah but I do like the idea but we yeah ID It uh but it then the docking station isnt relevant for this project anymore but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need ME No UI No but you otherwise you cant retrieve it ME Yeah I really dont get it ME I mean if its a simple chip then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents ID I think we can agree on this ID I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked ID Cause I think we uh Yeah I think thats what what what they uh mean But can we find out uh about uh this chips ME Yeah yep UI But for two Euros and thirty cents we uh we dont get a docking station ME I think so too ME Oh I dont know ID Because when we dont need a d a docking station then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip PM And then we can get a docking station ID And maybe then we can do something extra UI For For two Euros ID Oh n uh oh still oh its gonna get more expensive with ID Two ID Then we have some money left ID We can put then We can put a scrollwheel on it or something ID Yeah well who knows ME Uh why ME I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros that had a total a total thing it would be nice too I mean uh were not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it ID Or a little bit of tin titanium PM But what what can we do But uh what can we do with the simple chip and whats difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ID Yeah or we can ki do the kinetic cells ID Thats also maybe an idea ID Yeah thats what then what he has to find out ID Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us PM If if i Regular chip and because we dont have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip for example ID Maybe is that thats nice to know ID Yeah bu bu but when we yeah but when we skip when we um when we dont use the do were not gonna make the docking station then we still yeah we need something else maybe to make it kind of special because that was our our special feature ME I like the hand dynamo part ME We can make a plain docking station for two Euros PM Yeah PM Well go back uh tomorrow ME I mean Wi wi without recharge Yeah but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you dont put the recharge function in it ID Yeah okay you can also do that but maybe It still is a special remote control cons uh you know wi its form is special and material ME I mean it has a shape ID Yeah but for two Euros then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip then two Euros isnt even possible ME Of course it has a shape but i i Why should that not be possible ID Yeah then because then wed thirty cents left ME No for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip ID Yeah but yeah I dont know because maybe d uh yeah we have to find out with the simple chip PM Thats the question PM If we do i do we need an advanced chip or is it okay f No ME Yes ID Yeah and w and and we uh need f and what is this UI It isnt in my information so I dont know it uh either ID Sample sensor sample speaker UI It isnt in my information I uh I Ive got a schematic view of the remote control but nothing about uh advanced chips or Uh Ive got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it ID You can look at it for s presentation ID S technical functions PM No no they were uh mine yeah ID Oh UI When my mouse works again ID Oh oh oh ID Hey ID Oh UI My mouse is uh Yes ME Dead ME Reanimate it UI Oh PM Died UI Ah Ive got it UI I will put uh my email on the the network ME What the hell are these UI Its on it ME Oh whatever PM Yeah its open ID Mm ID I dont think here its in here already PM Its circuit board PM Its only just basics for for At the end circuit there is an infrared LED ID Its nothing about s yeah UI Yes ME This isnt helpful ID No ID But i in the presentation of yours there was also something about different components ID Which one was it PM Components design ID Functional requirements UI Um Yes that was mine ME No that was my presentation PM Components design maybe PM N on top ID Ah ID Ah yes it was the second one UI But that was my second Mm But this is the same uh This is o only the possibilities ID Yeah it was your second your first presentation ME Its already open ME Its at the bottom PM Working design ID Sorry ME Its uh at your task bar PM Yeah but its the the other one ME Oh ID Uh this is n this is not this n thats not the right one PM Was it working design or components design ME Sorry ID I dont oh ME Okay sorry ID No this is the other one ID Or maybe something is uh maybe theres something abo in in these Here PM Chip set UI Yeah UI We can use a simple a regular or advanced chip ME Yeah nice PM The display requires an advanced chip ME I it doesnt say anything ID You know that a pushbutton requires a simple chip but a scrollwheel it it me requires Okay so we only need a simple chip UI Ah okay PM Requires UI With the light PM Little lights PM Yeah but that thats just the same as the the LED ID No no thats just a simple chip ME Thats not needed ID A scrollwheel it s uh only states that a scrollwheel requires a regular chip and that a display requires an advanced chip ID So we dont need any of them ME A display uh is of course uh for showing letters UI LCD ME For showing text PM Yeah ME I dont think that uh just a l a little light Yeah I agree PM No PM I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay ID And whats the sample sensor slash sample speaker UI Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up page down PM Yeah ME Yeah I guess so too PM Yeah true ME Next channel PM Well thats not too what we want ME No ME Well we might want it but Yeah ID Okay UI All in twelve Euros ID Back to the costs UI Twelve Euros and fifty cents ID So were gonna use the simple chip PM So simple chip is okay ME Great ME Delete ME Yeah UI And the lights UI Where uh are the lights PM Yeah lights yeah theres no category ME Well therere three I guess ID Nah there is some money left to be spent PM Can we do it wi within two two Euro ME I think we can make a docking station ID Okay but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ME Yeah ID But I mean it isnt it hasnt got any innovative technology we arent gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway I think PM Mmhmm ID I dont I dont see any possibility to do so because it would wouldnt fit our defi design philosophy PM But its original ID But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something ME No thats true ID Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know so y so people wouldnt have to worry about their batteries anymore ME M bu Or the hand dynamo dynamo Yeah ID Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it Yeah you leave the p yeah I know but still I they will think about that UI But but sometimes you put a Kinetics arent uh nowadays only used in watches and thats because youre always walking ID I mean if you u The uh its made for s people well the they dont if it was uh uh r useless technology they wouldnt put it uh as a possibility UI Uh solar cells are useless ID And i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking ID Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source then it would be this one ID Because its one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot Hey that maybe thats cool thats a cool thing about it you know ME Yeah but but if we ca I dont know if Five minutes ID You dont use batteries ID Ive never seen it before in a remote control PM But then we could make a docking station ID No we we we cant make a docking station anyway ME Thats not true ID Yeah we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make Yeah but be serious then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control ME We can make a docking station for two thirty PM Wow w why no li Look at now we got two two thirty left ME Two thirty UI Fo for a docking station ME We can make a docking station PM Ca cant we make a docking station of that ME Sure UI With a cable with uh buttons on it with retrieval uh device in it ME Sure PM I dont know ME The power device is is i i is very cheap ME Thats just a regular uh power cable and whatever UI Wi with a button to wi with a button to retrieve it so it will beep PM Well we we uh Yeah then we dont have any innovation things ME So UI Uh so its uh wireless technology ME Yeah ID Yeah but we uh we dont inc we havent looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff ID I dont think its realistic for you to do so ME Well then its a useless project UI Look at the case the case the case of of uh of uh No then we have to sell it for thirty Euros ID Oh because we We well look at all the special stuff we have ID Colour a the colours are special the form is special ID It th this is whole concept ID Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing ME Cant we uh Cant we say fifteen Euros ME No sta yeah I mean No ID Uh no PM No we only make less profit of it UI Its the Maybe we can uh can do it both ME You can sell for twenty seven and a half ME Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs PM No ID Yeah I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic because of the you know it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control ME I dont think No UI Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote UI Battery and kinetic ID No that wouldnt n no ME Thirteen twenty ID Yeah and it is also not a good its not you have to really do it only kinetic you dont want it to think about batteries anymore ME And I think only Yeah but only kinetic then you gotta You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour really UI Yes but when its then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when its when its empty ID No no ID Yeah its great ID No no no ID No no this is very sophisticated technology technology ID When you use it your remote like once a day or maybe even less i i it It We can make it yeah no UI You asked for three d No thats n thats not true UI Uh a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time ME No ID Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it Yeah m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells UI Yes solar cells are also stated UI Why dont we use solar cells then ID Because I think the d whole dynamic part do you know appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy you know with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing and y when you move it around a lot then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah but you dont have to UI Thats true ME Yeah its funny for a week ME I guess something like that where you have to move it around very frequently is demotivating ID Trust me ID The idea of this technology is that you dont think about it it just happens ME No I I dont move my uh my remote control very much seriously ID Okay then we d Okay well y we dont have to do it but what that would just have a lack of key features you know UI Oui ID You m have to put something on your box ID You have to make people buy it and uh We can really can do the docking thing uh its not yeah uh we can do it but its would be a easy way out UI You can do it for fifty cents ME Well weve got more than fifty Cents UI The c The case the case alone is is is uh the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro ID Okay but we have to grou to agree upon something because uh we only have a minute left or so UI Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station ID No no its not possible ID Okay w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th its this is then then our concept is ready PM Cheap remote control ID Yeah we make some extra profit of it ME Yeah ME No we wont but thats um something else UI But now Great ME No this not gonna sell PM It w it wont tell but No uh n no Yeah we just have to go all what we did today again ID Huh any ideas ME No ME Of course not UI Its great UI Our remote control PM You have to do it over ME We come back tomorrow okay PM Yeah ID No no uh theres still theres still someth concept and something special left UI Yes PM the No but no UI Seventy Euros ID I mean were gonna its gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel ID Thats what its makes it special ID Yeah and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well to give it some just to give it some extra special feature and uh I know it will work but uh its its an Theyre theyre not putting technologies on this but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen UI Why not a hand dynamo then ID Okay well we leave it like this ID Then its c then were yeah PM Yeah yeah ME We cant do anything else ME Warning finish meeting now UI Were done ID Okay project e uh well we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet UI Is this it ME Yeah sure UI Okay ME No we cant ID Yeah we have to Yeah its Uh I dont know PM No ME Yes yes UI Yes ME Celebration ME I dont see why but I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire to be honest UI Wheres the champagne PM Yeah UI I dont uh hear a bell ME No not yet ME Alright Ill see you guys in a minute PM We can do it here then UI Bye ME I dont think so PM Can we cant we do it here ME I dont know ME I dont I dont think so UI Uhhuh UI Just fill that one in PM Yeah were doing now PM But its PM Oh okay PM Nice,"The project manager opened the meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. The remote has buttons for power, mute, teletext, volume and channel up/down, and nine numbered channel buttons. The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. The marketing expert led the product evaluation. The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. The overall score was 2.6. The group worked out the manufacturing costs. The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons, and did not know which kind of chip to use. They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting."
ME I dunno ME Throwing away my toothpick PM Hi there ID Yo ID Ow ME Kay ID Uh Yeah ME Nice user interface ID What the Uh Yeah well ja well lets just start ME Kay ID Ive uh made a presentation uh but uh Ill open it on the Smartboard so we can all see it ME Right lets see it ID So its in the project documents because thats what we can find here ID Well ID Very nice ID Well this is called the the the kickoff meeting ID So uh Im the Project Manager so I had to fill it in and uh hmm ME Kay ID Oh sorry ID And an uh a nice agenda ID Uh well do the opening and then uh well meet each other what uh we already do so thats not uh very much trouble ID Ill Ill show you the the tools we have here so that we can all use them ID Then uh well look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction ID Well discuss about our first ideas about the project and then uh well close the meeting and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh well get back here ID So this the opening well uh We have to uh design a new television remote control ID You have heard that uh already I think so ME Mmhmm ID Um we want it to be original so a nice uh a nice new design ID Uh trendy its also for young people and we have to just uh make it uh modern ID And uh friendly so size does matter ID And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place that kin those kind of things UI Mmhmm ID Other uh There happen to be uh three stages ID functional conceptual and d detailed design ID Um so every time we well do some individual work get meeting talk about it uh and then go into the next phase ID Thats just it ID Um We have uh these two Smartboards ID Um well as I just showed theres a project management folder a project document folder on the desktop ID It just works exactly the same as a computer ID You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop ID So you can uh make uh Words Excel everything ID Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things you can uh draw ID This is a uh well a drawing board ID you have a these different uh functions on the board ID You can see them there ID So you have a a nice pen and its works just like a bal ball pen ID This is just a ID I want to uh Oh yeah ID Of course w doesnt work any more UI Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it UI Yeah ID Yes I will eraser so UI It works ID Its fantas fantastic UI Wonderful ID We can uh uh well you can save a file ID So if uh we draw we have to save everything ID Dont throw anything away UI Mmhmm ID Uh just we can start a new one and we just go on and dont throw anything away ID Just uh let them all uh stand here ID We can delete but we dont do that ID Um you can here select a pen you can draw anything you want ID Its a bit uh childish you have to write ID Its not as fast as you w you know it but it does work sometimes ID Well its just like a normal uh paint ID So its gone UI Alright yep ID Well we are designers so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard ID So thats fantastic ID Um well this uh speaks for itself ID We going to try it ID So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board not my idea ME Alright your favourite animal ID Yes our your favourite ID So um Im to going to have to draw a kangaroo but Im going d Im not going to ID Im just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast w I dunno what Im going to design ME Grizzly bear ID Oh um doesnt oh UI I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment ID Yeah kay ID Hmm ID I just said its not my idea but I am the Project Manager and officially this is my idea ME Yeah UI I I I I understand ID So what ME Were kinda losing time though UI Alright ME Were losing time but Alright ID Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose loosen up a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah UI so start Yep yes ID Sh I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh No so a a few legs UI Dont uh count on it ME Do we have to guess ME A hippo ID Yes yes guess ID Well I should make it an hippo now UI I think its a mouse or a rat ME Yeah ID No I dont think so UI Oh UI Oh I know it ID Well what is it huh UI Its a hedgehog ME I dont know how to call it ID Yeah difficult English word ME A hedgehog ID I didnt knew it myself UI Well Im amazed uh about your uh drawing skills ID Our characteristics sum it up ID Well its uh very uh painful those kind of thing ID So we can uh just uh Were going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal UI Yeah ME Alright UI I am the Industrial Designer ME Thank you ID Huh UI Chief I am the Industrial Designer ID Oh uh but this uh marketing designer UI Yeah UI I think Its pr it resembles the animal drawn by ME Its ID what kind of animal is that then UI I think can I say it ME Yeah sure ID Uh it ME Its a rabbit ME Well Looks very nice right ID Yeah UI It looks amazing ID No no no ID What are you going to do PM We want to erase it ID No no ID No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document ME Yes UI These are very impor These are very important documents of course uh these drawings uh And he deliberately draws a animal we dont know the English word for ID Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh and then save it and start an blank document ME Yes uh right ME You go man PM Thanks ID Yeah ID Theres also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness ID So um well you should uh try it but uh Well y y y you could have but uh ME Alright ME I should have made mine a white rabbit ID It speaks for itself ID What the uh just a duck UI It looks like an uh It looks like that beast from Sesame Street ID Nice UI Yeah PM Big bird ID Is it a duck ME Youre standing in front of it I cant see it UI Its its uh Do we have to uh But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird ID Is it a plane ME Alright thank you ME Yeah its a bird but what kind of bird ID It doesnt draw uh circles uh that easy uh ME You have to push harder ID Yeah just a bit a bit childish a bit PM Mm ME Release your anger PM Uh no I dont UI No PM Its just a bird UI Well wonderful ID Well uh save the document and then uh And then a a new blank document for ID uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it PM Here you go UI Why do I have to do the difficult tasks UI Uh pen yeah thats ID No well first yeah ID And then you go to format I think and current colour you choose a new colour UI Uh current colour ID And a new pen width uh also format UI I like uh oh they dont have pink PM Mm UI Oh b oh think this is uh Uh ID Its not like in paint UI Uh Line width ID Line width ID And you can choose a nice one PM Width ID Width width UI Uh fifteen ID With each other UI And I can draw PM Hmm ID Yeah ID So ID Just a wa thats the way we do its quite easy UI Uh Oh the line width is too thick but oh well ME Hmm ID Mmhmm PM Its a pussy cat ME Its a cat ID Oh Pussy ID Well then you change it ID And erase things UI Uh ID What ME Its a pig UI It smiles nicely ID Super pig UI Now I have to change the line width UI Uh one ID So Yeah yeah yeah we know UI These are whiskers you know ME Right UI Uh well I think its obvious right now ID Yes alright ID Its a cat ME No it looks great UI Miaow UI Well if this isnt obvious Ill save it alright uh save ID Well well um Yeah save it and start a new blank document ME Just save it UI Uh yeah uh blank ID Yep ID So thats uh what were going to use when we uh need it UI Well I feel comfortable now ME Oh great ID Well its terrific eh UI Thanks for this exercise ME Its good for group spirit UI I feel totally at ease ID Yeah thats it PM It certainly is ID Were one big happy family now UI Yeah something like that ID Well then uh the serious uh stuff ID Were we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars but uh twenty five Euros ID Our profit aim is worldwide fifty million Euros UI So Alright ID So I didnt uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell ID we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff and uh marketing uh research ME Right ID Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ME Right ID Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait ID We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls UI Well I I didnt have to prepare anything about uh its not its its not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls but uh Mmhmm ID Please ID No uh I did ID Well uh just w were uh four uh if we if we would just have one then Yeah ME I think its im its important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors ME Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control ID Yeah yeah ME On our corporate site I saw uh a new DVD player uh were gonna produce ID Yep ME Maybe its important to make it compatible with the DVD player so you can uh use your television and your DVD player with the same uh remote control ID Thats alright ID That would be a nice idea yes ID Yep yep yep ME Furthermore its important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world for different cultures maybe because we want to we want to well fifty million ID Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit so ME Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it UI No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh yeah people in every country can recognise ME So Yeah PM Easy to learn ME Yeah thats right PM Yeah ID Yes PM Yeah ID Ill make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well Ill put it in the project uh folder when Im done uh just now ME Mmhmm UI Alright PM I also think we should not add too many buttons ID Well yeah ME Right PM Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think ID No thats right ID Y y you dont use uh the half of them thats thats culture uh international PM Precisely ME Maybe we could make one button to switch between DVD player and TV and make the other buttons uh multifunctional or something PM Yeah PM Yeah indeed ID Yes UI Yeah so it doesnt uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh And stereo uh s uh audio installations ME Yeah right ID Yep and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a DVD player ID Dont we have uh other uh ou Uh PM Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use we uh we make ID We also uh just uh released a TFT uh thing I saw ME Yeah so but th thats kind kind of standard T television so it also works on that ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yep PM And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes PM So we can keep that in mind UI Most people do yeah ID Well yeah UI It doesnt it doesnt have to be Yeah ID It doesnt have to be but we can PM W well its a n its a new remote and you dont buy a remote if you dont have anything to uh to control with it ID Well except if we deliver it together with our DVD ME Yeah but We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh Yeah but its it has to be useable PM Yeah alright but Yeah ID Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design Yes UI Well UI Hmm UI It has to be different and familiar at the same time ME Yeah PM Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour that kind of things ID Yep UI yeah the shape will will have to be recognised UI I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped but thats not uh very recognisable ID Yeah PM Well we we could make more more oval or something and and Yeah or so Well yeah its new ID Oo N we can use uh it as a as a game pad ME No UI Oval UI I Mm ID So one hand has the beer so the other hand uh Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because its a long time uh on the market ME Not with two hands ME Yeah yeah yeah right ME No Yeah but its quite important that it fits PM but young people want something different and it is Yeah ME Yeah UI Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah UI But you still have to know its a remote and not another Yeah PM Yeah alright ID So the the form will have been uh tested out so Yes UI Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh yeah useful or else uh they would have been ano another shape ID Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I dont like to use them ID I have uh have to it has to fit my hands ME Yeah PM Yeah ID When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here ME It shouldnt be boxy UI Yeah UI Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah UI You have to use one hand ID It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb ME Nah I dont agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand UI Why not PM Yeah it doesnt fit ID Tho tho those new DVD players on the market do have those ME Yeah UI But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this and you can make it another shape but then you have W no w what else ME Yeah but if you shape it If No thats ol old fashioned PM No if y if you look at new Phillips uh DVD with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes arent box shaped ID DVD players ID Yes PM Theyre all um Well Yeah UI I di Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ME I can imagine that us Well Yeah right PM Yes uh Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end ME It fits in your palms UI Hmm PM Mm UI Well but its still then uh the the long box uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand but its its still Yeah yeah al alright but but its still its still sort of box yeah PM Yeah it Yeah yea Hmm ME Hmm ID Well A it h it has it it has a thats tha th th shape that it fits your hand ME Um ID Thats We have five minutes left UI It it has round forms but it in the end its still the box so thats what I mean ME Well Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand UI Yeah yeah I understand but no no I dont mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course but in in in at the end its still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit ME It shouldnt be too boxy you know ME Its No no no ME Yeah ME Yeah it should be Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like DVD player and so you can Ive Yeah right and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and Right UI Yeah yes I thought about something like that UI Yeah UI A big recognisable button on top or something PM Yeah ID So Yes uh thats yep UI The buttons should uh also be not too small not too big of course and uh n uh uh not too close uh together ME But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button ID Yep ME So there has to be some space between the buttons UI Uhhuh UI Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions ME Yeah ME Yeah right right and maybe we should use colours UI Yeah UI Colours yeah PM Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but Well ME Yeah ID Ha ME Thats kinda trendy ME Yeah right ID Sound nice ID Yes UI I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um ID Well its just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually well have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera ME Right ME But I think its uh its important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make so we Yeah UI Already thought about something tha Mmhmm ID Yes ID Yes ID Well thirty minutes we have ID So um This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh ID Youll get specific instructions when youre back in your room so uh its uh logical uh ID I think ME No problem ID Oh and uh thats uh thats all ID So well just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over UI Yeah now we can still talk about the material we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course hard plastic the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh ID Yeah yes say PM Mm ME Yeah ME Yeah it shouldnt be too heavy UI No n n Mm ID Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when Ive had use it much it was gone PM Yeah thats bad yeah ME Yeah yeah yeah ID So it has to be made in the buttons I think ID It has to uh not be loose PM Yeah thats important UI Alright UI And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other ID Yeah ID Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so its all about uh Its not that in China its different ME Yeah its univ yeah yeah yeah UI I think so UI Its a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think ME Yep ID Yeah ID But y you can have uh of course different between DVDs and televisions and between Yeah ME And you can use Yeah UI It its a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things PM Yeah PM But our TVs are mostly made in China and that sort of country so ID Probably yes ID China rules UI And have well yeah Ive wrote something down about how it works UI The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly but thats pretty obvious I think ME But are Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ID Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes ME I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it you know ID Yeah ME You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy ID Yes ID Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it but you can change them uh when you buy the And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well th those fifty million dont uh dont se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh PM Yeah ME Right PM Yes ME Right PM Yes PM Mm PM Well you can make profit with them and its a way to make them trendy ME Yeah UI Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy ME Yeah right PM Yeah alright PM Yeah normal ID Yes ID Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and DVD set we are going to sell so if they are uh black and black black and silver well make them black and silver so PM No a colour everyone accepts PM Mm UI Pink television sets pink remote PM Mm ME Yeah yeah yeah PM Yeah PM standard ME But people of often dont like bright colours or something ME We have to make it grey or s or black PM Well young people s li Yeah yeah yeah ME Yeah but then you can use a a front UI Alright ID Yeah UI I must not forget my pen the next time ID Well if if you yeah ID If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front theyll theyll love it PM Yeah ME Yeah thats right ID I think ME Yeah or a t Teletubby front ID But thats uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh ME Yeah yeah yeah ME I will investigate ID Yes ID Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I dont know what your specific instructions will be but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote ID And you will look into the technical design and um form I think UI Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remotes also my task yeah ID Or something like that ID Yeah ID Yeah ME Right PM Whats the uh url or the website cause I didnt get Yeah UI Yeah I uh w was wondering that too UI Y you went to the company website ID Euro ME Its Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer Yeah ID Well it it its if you uh Finish meeting now UI Its the the the start uh starting page uh Very handy to know PM Oh oh right oh well I didnt uh use it ID Oh alright ID Well uh were going to back uh back into our rooms so In thirty minutes but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here PM Yes ME Well thats great PM Next meeting is in Thirty minutes ME Thirty minutes PM Yeah alright its its handy to know Oh ID Ill have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh its its the half of the normal size ME Its totally broken UI Right see you in half an hour then ID Oh right oh PM Goodbye UI W Right uh see you in thirty minutes then ID Ma W that was a nice meeting ME Oh PM S ID Yeah see you,"After introducing the remote control objective, the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using. They tested it by drawing animals. The project manager informed the group of the budget, before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas. They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote. It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons. The considered options for the shape of the remote control, imagining how it would fit in the hand. The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues, and discussed remote covers."
ME Great man ME Who starts ID Well Ill uh start just with another presentation so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting ME Alright great ME Alright ID Okay ID Ive put some uh new things in the in the map ME Mmhmm ID Uh oh ID This is it ID I dont know the shortcut so Ah F five ID Well our functional design meeting thats the stage were in UI Mm ID And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it ME Yes ID Well um in well uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting what we uh thought we had dec decided ID But uh Uh then well uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you ME Kay ID I think you have prepared uh all three uh UI Well yeah ME Yeah ID Um well look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno ID Y you also have uh received that mail the new project requirements from our bosses UI No ME No ID Oh Ive received a mail with uh some additional requirements and Ill have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations because its not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we cant because of the new requirements ME Youre the only one UI Oh ME Alright ME Kay ID Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions ID We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be ID And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely UI We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ID Uh Uh yeah I think so UI Alright ID Well uh the closing uh well not uh look at it yet ME Alright ID Um now Ill look at show this board ID Um Well uh notes first meeting ID Now ID I gave a disc a a presentation ID Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas ID So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors and uh look at their uh remote controls ME Right ID We should make it uh compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have our technical releases UI Huh ID Uh not too many one buttons ID One recognisable button in the middle where you do the most important functions with ID And um well they can have two functions because uh you have a DVD and a television UI Yeah ID Um the design has to fit the hand be original but also be familiar ID Its uh one of our ideas ID Yeah well that wa Its just thirty minutes ago so its not quite uh But well I have to do it UI Mmhmm now its right ME Yeah ID The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible ID It should be uh recognisable at all times UI Its meant to be easily wiped out yeah PM Mm ID Yes ME Okay ID Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones ID And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons the functions should be universal standards ID Well thats just uh some ideas from the first meeting UI Mmhmm ID Its quite logical al all of it ID Um now the new project requirements Ill just show them ID I got this mail from uh our bosses ID Well teletext goes out PM Oh ID We will not use teletext ME Okay ID Maybe a new sort of thing but n but not teletext UI I I disagree but uh its not uh t its not my place to disagree I guess ID Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the DVD and they dont want it because of our time we have for this project PM Oh ME Alright UI Oh alright PM Oh thats a shame ID So thats a shame because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years ID Because uh we dont have those customers a lot at th at this point ID Um well its a bit pity because its just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it ME Yeah ME But lets forget about it ME Its just timeconsuming so we uh have to go on ID Yeah ID Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products ID So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan maybe a colour and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh well as we already said a actually uh familiar ME Yes ID Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company UI Yeah we are a real fashionable company UI I read uh I read it on the I didnt know what company we were but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Yeah ME Mm ID Yeah UI So it has to be uh a modern design ID Okay UI Thats important to know uh when you design a thing of course ID Yes ID I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have our company ID Its uh we mm put the fashion in electronics UI Yeah ME Right ID So maybe thats a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something PM Yeah ID Alright then um were going to uh have three presentations ME Yeah ID You want to start ME Yeah ME I think I have to start ID Oh you have to start ID I didnt see anything about uh who had to start ME Oh no no problem UI The order UI No ID Well s then start PM Mm ME I I just have to uh to think which files mine cause I was uh bit in a hurry ID Okay ID Well uh You already uh opened uh PowerPoint ME I think its this one ME But Im not sure ME Hmm ME Yeah ME S Right ME Yes ME This is it ID Yeah ME Well Im going to tell you something about functional requirements ID Mmhmm ME Um to start with these points ME Uh next sheet ME Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls because its uh a smart thing to exclude those things ME Uh furthermore its very important what they do like and what they do use ME Um then I tell something about um the most important issues ME So we have to focus on those three thing three things ME And in the end Ill um show you our target audience or our target product users customers ME Well um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly ME Thats seventy five per cent of the current users ME They dont like it so we might think about fronts in that section ME Um They also say thats about uh I thought it was fifty per cent uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls ME So its very important that you design a a nice looking control ME Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions ME Uh almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity ME So its really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy ME Furthermore its uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot ME Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle so you can reach it with your thumb UI You can zap away ME Yeah yeah right ID Yeah UI Yeah ME Right ME A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room ME So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television thats your um your control beeps or something that you can find this very easily PM Yeah ME I dunno maybe thats an idea ID Well It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions ME Cause its uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control within the same room UI Oh UI Oh PM Yeah ME So Yeah but what if you lose your clickon device ID So if you deliver a small uh clickon device that you can put on your television that bleeps to your remote control everyone can use it ID No you can click it on your television ME Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ID Yeah in another room yeah ME Nee but it it specifically says its uh the the control is lost in the same room ID Well yes UI Mmhmm ID Yeah ME So Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem ID Well well have a look at it yeah ME Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks its its too uh too difficult to learn ME So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it UI I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote of course ME Yeah but people dont read manuals UI Uh I didnt read it UI Oh alright ME No PM No UI users to uh add one UI Do you think PM I dont think Yeah ME I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use than a manual UI Mmhmm PM Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how its supposed to work UI Yeah alright ID Yep UI Because they dont use it UI Alright ME Yeah ID Well there sh should always be a menu but it c can be very short ME Right ME And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes PM Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control I think ID Yes okay UI Well maybe for the If you dont recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I dont know it ME Alright PM Yeah right PM It sh it should be there the manual PM But but not to explain how the remote works PM Only Hmm ME And we dont have much time ME So its better to uh put our attention to the the design ME So you can pick up and use it than I think ID Well we are a design team we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point ME Yeah right right UI Isnt it part of the of the u No ID So Well well have a look UI No UI Never mind ME Next point ID Um yes ME Um RSI ME Well thats about twenty per cent I thought ME But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat UI Consider the m Yeah ME Yeah consider the consequences of using your remote ME It should be a good in your hand UI Mmhmm ID Yep ME Right this is the most important part ME Um were Like the requirements said were gonna specify of were gonna target a younger audience ME Um thats about sixty per cent of the market so its uh quite important ME Um research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their uh zapping uh device ME Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that ID Well Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost we cant uh afford an LCD uh Yeah ME So its very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs UI Its going to be expensive PM No UI Yeah ME Yeah but they think its really important ME So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff maybe we can uh buy it very cheap I dunno ME We have to uh Yeah I dont know UI Well well uh consider it uh ID Well Yeah well uh its your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know UI Well think abo well think No well look well look into that later ME I dont have any information on that ME So Right UI Alright ME And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition ME They also like that but research is very uh costly PM I think thats uh difficult to realise also ME So Yeah but it it might be important for the sale UI We have very demanding clients ID Its not yet a standard uh development uh those so We sh Yeah absolutely PM No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think ME Well I do think LCD is more reachable than the speech recognition PM Yeah ME So we might consider LCD screens UI Yeah yeah alright UI Well well consider both and and see what uh what what we can find I think PM No ME Alright ID Yep UI We dont rule them out uh yet ID Kay ME Alright ME Um I think thats it ME Um I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes ID Alright ID Yes ME So you can Right ID Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation ME Yeah ME Right ID Its in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next ID You uh got uh Yes UI Shall I give a technical talk PM Oh you go UI Alright ID Well go ahead UI Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design ID Yip UI We have that here UI Okay how do you enlarge it so that you can have the F F five ID F five ID F five UI Yep ME Alright UI Well the working design thats my uh Well alright uh you know who I am and what I do ME Next button UI So uh we have this UI Its a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something UI It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple ME Oh right ME Purple UI But I think you can read it ME Yeah yeah yeah UI Um well um I think its important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control ME A bit UI Uh well you can see uh And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page ME Maybe you can select it ME So it uh inverts ME the p the whole picture ME Nah uh never mind ID Click UI Well you can read it its not too difficult PM Yeah go ahead UI Meanwhile this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works UI You have uh basically uh the energy the power of the of the remote control uh and the sender w which is the LED the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the no to the set ME Yeah ME Alright UI And uh the source is of course the user UI Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course UI And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip and the chip uh sends it to the LED and the LED sends it to the receiver UI Thats the thats the basic idea ID Yep UI Very basic UI Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps UI Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key UI It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed UI The key a signal to a chip uh the chip senses the connection UI uh and recognise the key UI So well you understand UI The chip uh produces Morse code um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed of course UI And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED which is the bulb of course UI Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the well its uh very simple and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the TV set and the TV set uh also recognises the the the signal and performs the assigned task ID Yeah ID So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh Im now busy with a DVD uh if we had done that ID And a button for TV UI Ah bu Yeah but we dont UI Uh we No no but Yeah ID So Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place and you keep making the same um well moves UI Exactly UI Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote UI Ive some couple of pictures here UI Its a very basic one UI And uh if we if were going to add an uh an uh LCD screen to it it uh wont look anything like this but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control UI It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh its its quite um Yeah you can easily recognise the buttons UI Theyre uh far enough apart and an anything UI Its not very um uh not very hightech uh indeed and its not very userfriendly PM High tech UI Uh if you look at the shape its uh just a simple long box uh shape UI So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that uh so that uh it becomes more userfriendly and that uh problems like uh RSI and uh those kinds of thing dont dont oc dont occur ME Right ME Can I say something UI Yeah ME Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons ME Uh the power button is used very much channel selection volume and teletext ME Well teletext is not an option so that uh But I think its very important to make um the power channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb so you cant have RSI uh consequences UI Mmhmm UI Yeah because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately You dont have to look and and search for them ME Right ME Make them big make them easy to uh to press PM You can also like Yeah I was thinking you can Are some of the the the um Maybe you can make for for channel changing two little buttons on the side of the remote so you can just do like this ME Right ME Yeah right ID But if y if you would put it at a different place then you have to move your hands and thats on of the things about RSI ME Right ME Yeah thats right ME Thats right ME Thats right UI Well you you cant have any uh every button under the thumb of course ME We But Yeah ID No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R RSI RSI ME Thats very important ME And But is that is that useable PM Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ID Yes Ive saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons ME Do people uh when they pick up a remote know that they have to do that ME Its a f its a new feature you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it PM Well Yeah alright but Yeah but if you s say them up and down they theyll understand it I think ID Well it its Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote Yeah UI Yeah PM Eighty per cent would UI Well ID If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote and he picks up it he he touches the side then hes a already on the next channel ME Yeah he feels it immediately PM Yeah thats true ID Thats very irritating I think ME Yeah thats right ME Yeah PM Yeah but Mm ID Well ME Right continue ME Sorry UI But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed and as you say at the thumb ID No UI I think thats a good idea and uh and that the less important uh buttons like the the the different channels uh the numbers one two three four five as well should be uh yeah well not in reach because uh they dont use it uh all the time UI Well its uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said ID Yep UI And I have some pictures of the inside workings but uh I dont want to get too technical because uh thats not uh very uh useful for you ID Mmhmm ME Yeah thats right ID Thats your part of the job UI So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside ID Yep UI And uh well thats about it I think UI Oh yeah I still have this UI Oh I had to delete this but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time but uh dont uh dont look at it please ME Alright ID Okay ID Well we understand ME Alright UI I I think its its clear uh how it works ID We understand ME Yeah its clear UI Alright ID Oh right no UI Thats the most important thing ID Nice UI Alright ID Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation UI Uh Right ID How late is did we start his presentation uh ME I dunno ME I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ID Wha Yeah ID Well then we have still the time so But we do have to come to a decision right later on ME Losing time losing time ME Yeah right ME So I dont think so ID So Oh yeah PM Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing but obviously thats not the case UI Yeah uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages with different links PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah right ID Uh PM For instance you couldnt see this ID Okay yeah well PM Um Yeah PM Well Im Mike User Interface Designer ID Mmhmm PM The the method PM Well I used my own experience with remotes took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website which are these two ID Yeah PM Um Yes these are from from another uh manufacturer ME These are already in use ME Alright okay PM Um This one is engineeringcentred so this one has the most functions and um things PM This one is usercentred ID Yeah UI Mmhmm PM Um I like usercentr centred uh uh also the best ME Well Yeah me too ID I like usercentred ID Yeah ID We also do that PM Um Well I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the DVD also and teletext and that kind of stuff ME Mm PM Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one ME But we have to reject that because of the requirements PM But Yes ID Yeah PM Th thats why this mm is not relevant any more I feel ME Alright PM Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh well need ME Yeah right PM I um I kinda like the shape PM I think this is what we talked about PM But No Ive Well I showed it somewhere ME Yeah UI You cant really see uh the differ from different sides UI But I think uh Uh you can draw it if you Yeah PM Um Oh yeah PM I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front PM So we can can uh yeah customise the Mm ID Mmhmm ID Well absolutely but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company ID So we cannot just uh make someone w No but thats th the side they look uh look at is the front PM Yeah PM Its a front PM Its not the the whole remote that changes of course ME But it Yeah thats right PM You can Mm ID So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it then uh our recognition is totally gone PM Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote ME Yeah thats a must PM So l like Ericsson does every uh S something like this ME We must have that ID Yeah we must UI We can put it on the on the back side ID Yeah well and and Yes PM Its recognisable ID Kay ME We can make a symbol of the company right here PM Um Yeah ME And if you put a front on it theres a hole on the front ME So the symbols always on Yeah UI Yeah so that you dont replace the symbol yeah PM Yeah yeah ID Yeah yeah yeah PM Something like that in the Yeah ID Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isnt changed by the front ME Yeah yeah UI Mmhmm ME But lets not focus on the front PM Yeah ID Those kind of things ID Yes ID Okay PM Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought wed wed use more function PM If we we had to include more functions PM But we dont PM So um Yeah ID Mmhmm ME Alright PM I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need PM Maybe some less PM Like eject we dont need and some other buttons we dont need PM I think uh Yeah I will UI Mike uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file UI In Map PM I think uh for the remote um uh less is more PM The less buttons the better the design PM Um We should go with that concept I think ID Yeah ME Yeah I agree PM I know ID Alright ME Ive Ive got another point ID Yeah ME Um there are two target audi audiences and weve uh chose for the younger one ME Um research has shown that um its a high interested uh in features PM Mm ME They are high high interested in feature ME But they are more critical ME Fo Yeah critical UI The younger uh Mmhmm ME So The younger audience ME So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people ID Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top and the bottom side of the front has a little clip a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people dont use but s some do do ME Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually But Yeah I think m most Most uh Mmhmm ME Clip arent used much ID Well but because you say they their features are important they want m um a lot but not Yeah ME Yeah right PM Yeah but what kind of features PM Like LCD screens and voice recognition ME Yeah but Yeah PM But Ive Yeah thats nice ME Here look at these numbers ME The newest features are like I said are uh LCD and uh speech uh control ME Our audience these people are very like these uh features ME You see ME So we must build in something or they will to uh go to the concurrent UI Uh UI Yeah ME The concurrent UI Our competitor ID Competitors UI Yeah ME Competitors right ME So I do think we have to uh have some features ID Yeah ME Even though they cost a little more ID Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little LCD th that you can click on or something or that you can click uh out uh of the remote ME Right ME Right ID And if if thats gives you a little bit of sta status information ME Like a tickertape ID Yeah ME Which programme you are l watching or something ID Those kind of things uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V VCRs ID And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also you they can display which programme youre currently watching ME Yeah right UI Yeah ME Yeah right UI Yeah UI So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your LCD screen ID Yeah ID For example ID It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it PM Yeah we should keep that simple too UI But should it uh really be uh clickable uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy PM It will No it should be uh integrated ID Yeah ME No not clickable ID Well maybe ME Nah no no no PM I think Yeah something like on um some radios in car ME Yeah just at at the top ME So when you s you sit like this you can can watch ME I think it should be at the top ID Yeah ID Yeah PM You Where its yeah walking to Yeah ME Yeah right ME Its a tickertape idea ID RDSs or something UI But thats of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design with the scrolling text and that kind of thing PM Wa Yeah ME Well its just one script ID Well I think its you got It just means its a script thats uh keeps it uh rolling and its not uh Thats five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah ME Yeah five minutes of ja ja for programming ME So I dont think thats the issue ID No UI Alright ME Alright we go with the LCD screen ID Uh well I think so yes PM Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost ME Kay ID Um Were g No but were well have to look into that ME Right I dont know if I can find that but Next time PM Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah ID Um we can use this board again I think ME Yeah right ID Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want th the issue ID Where is my presentation ID Uh Uh Well I mean were all here now I think ME Yeah I understand what youre saying ME We should have a general idea of how its gonna look ID These Ive already given you ID So we have to decide on the different remote control functions ME Right ID So we want to have a small LCD screen thats special ME At the top UI Shouldnt we start with the most important parts PM At the top or at the bottom ID Yes UI The LCD screen alright but we should start with the power button ME I think the top is more uh When you s How do you zap UI Uh Huh ID Yeah PM Yeah but Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural ME You just sit in your chair ME With the remote ID That thing is terrible PM Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom ME Yeah but thats where your hand ball might be ID Uh Well Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom ME Yeah I dunno PM Yeah no Mm UI And then uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here ME Well draw two and then well see uh No Um he thinks Yeah right UI I dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something ME He thinks its better to put the LCD at the bottom and I think its better at the top UI Uhhuh UI Why do you think its better at the bottom PM Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody ME But your Yeah UI But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down so that theres room for the for the interface PM I c Well I d I think thats thats ugly but I th Yeah ME The the ticker The LCD is like like small ME Its its wide ME Its not not high UI Uhhuh ME But Yeah right UI And and we can Bottom PM Power button always Yeah PM Yeah ID So and and I I like to use the ones on the top PM Yeah y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah ID So when I u when I have to have an LCD s scr window Yes but we we we we dont want that ME But Were making a remote with with a few functions you know UI Well thats a bit exaggerated UI Well I agree with you UI Its its also more recognisable ME We Hightech UI It looks more like a calculator to people if you have the l the the the thing on top PM Yeah you dont want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote ID We dont want them to look like a calculator ID We want to look it like our original but familiar Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White UI Yeah w well but uh you dont have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away uh because I think its uh I think its still important to have it at the top because its uh its more familiar that way PM Yeah ME Width ID Width ID Uh format yeah format ID Line width ID Width ME Th thats not a problem ID Yeah ME When I draw here it Oh ME Huh ID Its a bit off ME Yeah its off ID Well UI A little a little bit ME It it needs to be calibrated again ID Well uh lets uh talk about that later uh Its special pen ME Well Where UI Maybe you should another pen UI Maybe thats uh better UI You e you only have one pen for that screen UI Yeah ME Alright we have to make a decision now because we dont have much time ID Yeah ID No ME Um I think we have uh a few functions and we can put uh the LCD above it and still have lots of room at the bottom where you can put your hand UI Yeah UI I I agree ID I think it should be at the button bottom UI Well Im the I Im the designer so um Yeah PM At the bottom ID Bottom ID The LCD PM In a few minutes Oh yeah oh yeah I totally agree ME At the bot So We are two uh VS two ID Yeah PM Yeah ID Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions and then look at the design PM Hes the boss ME Right ME Great UI Uh we uh we were busy with that ID Because we have to decide this UI Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing ID Yeah UI So we have the power button ME And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the LCD s ID Yes ME Its uh your its your job UI Yeah of course UI Uh its uh PM No its our job UI Yeah ID Well we have a power button UI W wh While you have to agree I can say its like this and you must agree ID Guys PM For all of us I think ME Yeah right ID Guys ME Alright lets keep it central UI Yeah ID We have a power button setting buttons LCD window the number buttons Uh Yes PM The ten numbers PM Yeah UI Channel yeah PM Volume UI Volume control UI Um Well lets look at your uh design ME Mm ID Uh the mute button UI Uh Uhhuh ID I h love that one PM I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ID Yes PM Yeah in circle you know ID Yeah ID Yeah yeah yeah ID Well thats thats also design PM And and a volume control also in it ID Yes ME Right ID Um Well h ho Yes UI Yeah UI But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else a DVD player or something ID Yes PM Yes as I already said we could drop some of these buttons ID They are for some uh video uh Apart UI So Yeah its its also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand ME You should put that uh power button channel and volume should have the most uh importance PM Yeah PM I think these should be in one big circle in the middle ME Yeah but what he said about RSI was t kinda true ME When when you uh put them all in the same place the most used buttons youre doing the same thing all the time and thats just what RSIs all about ME So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other ID So people have to move their hand ID And they get less uh complaints of RSI UI Y Yeah ID Thats what I always do because all my i important buttons are the same place UI Its good to move uh from time to time UI Yeah PM Yeah but people dont like it when their buttons are all over the place ME Um Frequency of uh button use ID Yes PM They they need to be centred UI No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ID Well not Yes ME Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour ID Uhhuh PM Volume hardly ME You can see ME So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart I think up and down UI Mmhmm PM No I dont think UI Oh ID Up and down far apart from each other UI Far apart ME You thinking uh about RSI PM Yeah but Yeah but No ID Well not too much ME Y look at uh look at the frequency ME Nei not too much but Nei nei nei n I I totally agree PM The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important PM So Well they are used four times an hour so Power bu button should be left at the top UI I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together but you dont have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together ID Well for example the power button you can If someone is constantly z zapping its not going to miss that it that the power button is not right beside it ID Because I have someone But the buttons is way ID So that one can be put away ME But just Yeah ME Right ME Yeah ME I agree ID The power button can uh be uh uh Yes ME And should and should be red UI Yeah ID Oh man five minutes ID Yeah well five minutes left ME Right just make some decisions ID Yep ME The most important things we have to uh I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now ID Um how are we going to do it with those numbers UI C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now I think UI Uh it it doesnt work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing ID Well I have it here ID Yeah well thats going to take too too much time ME Just uh you decide that you decide that and ready PM Mm ID Yes PM Yeah UI Mm ID Yes UI Alright ID Well the LCD ID Um you are Industrial you are User Interface ID So I think its going to go to Mike ME Yeah ID But you will have to make consensus with ID Well Well its a bit hard because we are going to be uh individually PM Well consensus um We we can put it in the middle so Alright ME Nei ME Were No Were deciding now so Top or bottom ID Thats a bit uh Yes UI Well uh yeah I I still think its its quite important though to uh to have it at the top so Yeah ID Yes it is UI You say familiarity isnt important but Yeah d Yeah ID Well what if were going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round ME Okay ID Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ME Yeah right ME Okay ID Alright these functions UI As we we we we agreed we do have a LCD ID The number f Well yes thats alright UI So thats thats enough ME Yeah okay ID W the number function UI Yeah ID Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mikes screen with uh one button that says Im going to do a t two number digital PM No ID How do you want it to do then UI Theres one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero PM Well just when you push a one one and No if you On most TVs if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other d it Yeah ID It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more UI Oh like that UI Um Theyd recognise it ID Yes UI Th thats the most That thats very easy ID Alright so no button for that PM Yeah PM Yeah ME No UI Yeah ID Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote UI I think these are the the most important functions ME Do you still have the pictures over there PM Yeah ID So No wed uh just said we didnt uh Well uh Um well because we cant integrate it with any other uh remotes all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant ME Yeah thats about it ME You do need the uh multi Or did uh No like this one ME You do need them ME Yeah I know ME But are we Alright alright uh Now okay ME Right ID So just for a television is that all we need ME Yeah its most useable this way PM Yeah UI basic function ID Teletext is gone ID So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing ID Well have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones were l f forgetting ID Uh theres um screen ID You can make it wider and less wide ME Yeah ID And the button that you can go to AV for your video ME Right ME I do think we have to put that underneath a clip UI Oh yeah ID Those two ID But its just two and we make a clip UI Uh just two just two under uh under uh I I think uh But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section ID Th thats a bit uh waste PM We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here ID Yes ME Yeah ME Okay right ID Or at the top ID Your LCD screen is going to go PM Or at Yeah alright then UI Uh thats thats too complicated ID Yes UI You can just put it somewhere They they arent used much not as much as those other so you can put it somewhere Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom ID Yeah Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote PM Oh they can be small or round like buttons UI Yeah UI Yeah or at the top yeah UI What do you think uh those those buttons UI Above or down UI And w where UI Well we design it later UI We have it and we design later where everything goes ID Yes ID Yes UI Yeah ID Yes ID Well any other uh Go to video thats always on your remote control ME Well if you you take those th If you Yeah but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah but when you zap down zero you get to AV PM Why go to video ID To AV uh to AV AV AV UI The the video channel uh PM Thats just zero PM Yeah ID Well l n no not at not at my remote UI No no not always UI Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel ID Yeah PM Yeah but you can can zap down Yes I think th No then you press ninety nine ID Yes ID I dont ID I go to ninetynine ME Ah uh well whatever PM I think go to video is an irrelevant button but Yeah well y you must have ID Th thats the button uh No UI But its easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel you do you have to push a to to get below zero ID No you can ch push zero UI Its more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button ID Yeah ID Yeah I I think that one button is uh I use it uh Yeah ME Yeah but if were choosing to uh incorporate these buttons you have to have uh channel setting if you wa if you have a new TV ME You have to set the channels ME Right all th these uh different buttons you have to Ah I do ID These buttons I dont have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote UI Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width ID Its its incorporated with p m plus and down uh those So we still have one uh four PM Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh Yeah alright ME Right ME Thats the only one we put uh in there ME For a screen uh fu uh channel setting ID Ch ch Okay UI Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah ME Programme right ID Oh the Okay button ME Uh Ah ID Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button for your menu UI Yeah ID Menu button UI You should Yeah UI I think thats important UI Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast ID Channel setting menu ID We have to go ID Okay UI Channel yeah ID So um Save UI Chief UI Chief ID Yes see UI Th the menu menu button is also important UI Then you can uh Where ID Yes I have put it in UI I dont see it ID Here UI Oh Menu alright PM I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu yeah UI In the menu UI And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something PM Yeah the Or the volume or something like that UI Because uh the zapping buttons arent used then if you are in the menu ID Alright ID Guys UI Yeah UI Or the volume yeah ID Were going to uh go to our uh rooms and uh well have to decide s things on our own I think PM Your pen ME Great ID So Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime by the way now uh so uh Lunch UI Yes chief ME Alright PM I thought wed uh lunch uh right now or not UI Yeah this is this is your thing ME Ah PM Yeah lunch break ME Okay UI I am hungry ME Get into my belly ID Ah UI See you later mate,"There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 30. It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting."
ID Okay ID Uh door is closed ID Well lets begin ID Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting well have to hurry up ME Im listening ME Right ID Um well Ill start with the presentation again the agenda ME Great ID Yo ID So ID Uh This one I think ID Uh yeah ID Well alright ID Um well Ill show you the notes ID Its not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting but Ill show them ID Well get your presentations again on the conceptual design ID Um Then well have to dec decide about the control the remote control concepts UI Mmhmm ID Ive put a f uh a file in the project management folder which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take ID So this time we exactly know what to decide about ME Alright great ID And then well close again UI Alright ID Uh Well these are some examples but well talk about them later ID Well first look at your uh presentations UI Mmhmm ID Alright ID Walter will uh start again this time ME Yeah great ID Yo ME Alright Trendwatch ID Kay ME Right ME I will speak about uh latest trends trends latest fashion updates and uh things we must not do ID Kay ME Uh the trends ME Its very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling ME Uh this because of our last model was very functional but it uh people didnt like that so our new mo model must be very goodlooking ME Thats uh something you uh have to take a look at UI Mmhmm UI Alright ME And uh the feeling has to be very great ME Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great UI Alright ME Um theres a minus uh two times here because this is the most important point ME This is uh two times as less important and uh same for this one ID Less ME Um technological technological innovations thats uh regarded very highly too ME Uh such as an uh LCD screen uh speech uh acknowledgement as we uh talked about earlier ID Well yeah ME So we have to have uh something like that like we uh Right ID LCD and our uh our fronts ME Uh the last point is easy to use ME Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself ME I dont know whos uh whos going to look at that UI Easy to use ID Well easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue and then easy to use ME Yeah UI I think thats your ta Mm ME Yeah I know ID Well we have to choose one of them ME I think we have to go for the first one ID Yeah ME Its the most important one ME So we have to uh take that one ID Okay ME So it it it isnt very important that that it works easy PM Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use ME But it has to look great ID Yeah ID Well well look at uh ME Well see UI You Yeah UI Yeah yeah you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway so ease of use Its not a very comp complicated device ME Yeah right ME But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow thats real great uh great concept UI Alright ID Kay ME Alright ME Uh these are the new colours of this year ME So it must be very bright very colourful ME People like this ME So we we have to think uh in this direction ME So i set your mind to it ID So Well Yeah well Yeah ME Findings ME Fashion update ME Fruit and vegetables are cool ME I am told UI Uh you think ME The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables ME So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way PM Bananas ME Uh furthermore uh material thats your part should be very strong ME I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it maybe in a colour or something that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong UI Mm ME And thats uh also for the younger public ID B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year ID Th this year its fruits but next year its its something totally different ME Yeah thats great PM Yeah ME But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin ID Yes ME So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily UI Mm ID Yep alright ME Well the donts ME Older people like dark colours and simple shapes ME Well we dont want uh older people we want young people ME So uh were gonna turn that around ME Were gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours UI Alright ME Right ID Wood is popular ME Okay ID Aha ME We dont want wood UI Yeah among the old people yeah ID Yeah yeah yeah ME Old people ME So thats it for me ID Alright ID Nice uh well show us UI Right I am going to tell you something about the components design UI Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties UI This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device UI And the materials UI Um I have heard several things so I uh Ill have to change that on the way UI But uh the case UI Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic UI But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong ME Yeah we should change that UI It should feel strong UI So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient UI We should move to uh something Well yeah ID Well maybe it it it is but it doesnt look strong ID So maybe But we still have to look at our price of course UI Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough but it doesnt have a really really tough look ME No no no UI So Yeah ID Because uh if we want an LCD uh window etcetera uh Yeah UI Also Yeah UI Mmhmm UI But well return to that UI Uh the buttons of course rubber I think everyone agrees UI And electrical cables copper is all pretty basic stuff UI The chips made of silicon I guess UI I think thats the best uh way to do it UI And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb UI Then Ive uh had a few findings made a few findings UI Uh the target audience product style UI Um its uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like as you said uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that UI They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style UI But of course thats not our uh things this UI So this is things we must not do ID Yes UI And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people which is of course our uh group the people we aim at UI Um under forty five years old UI Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours UI Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking ME Mm ME Yeah UI But they like soft materials uh so we might uh we have to consider that PM Yeah UI And also they like curved round shapes UI So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want UI And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices gaming devices should define the characteristics of the device UI But uh since we dont have a really a sports or gaming device so we dont really have to consider that ID Sports uh theyre uh that uh are accessible on on your LCD uh window uh Huh PM Soccer fronts PM Mm UI Mm ID Thats nice PM Hmm UI Well I also have um several examples of uh styles so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean ID All the results ME We keep coming back to the fronts PM Yeah ID Yeah UI Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples stuff ID Yeah ME Yeah UI It was not very uh interesting uh very classical looking but thats n thats not what we want ID Mmhmm UI We have these kind of things PM Hmm UI I dont know what exactly they are UI It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes its very primary colours uh bright colours and uh round shapes ID Nai ID Uh no UI You also uh see uh this device its not very round and Fruity of course ME Fruity ME Fruity UI Yeah it uh Thats true ID Its t terrible ID Alright UI And uh well round shapes primary colours UI You can see it all here UI And of course uh this famous device ID Hmm UI I think as you know something uh some devices like this ID Yeah alright UI So to give you an idea of uh This has a strong look ME Well its got a strong look this UI Although its plastic its its grey to to to give it iron look ME Yeah ME Yeah it still has a strong look ID Yeah ID And its round UI Thats uh Yeah ME But then you are losing your fruity colours UI Well we have to make a Well we cant really make a round uh a round remote control ID Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour ME Thats true ID So uh those kind of things you can you can combine UI I dont think thats very practical but But uh its important to to uh to think about the colour ID No it isnt ID Okay UI Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger ME Yeah but the But it doesnt have to look strong ID Yes UI Cause if you look at this it it doesnt look very very strong becau But this is plastic and and this too but The feel ME The the results are the feel of the material is expected to be strongy ME The feel UI Uh alright UI Well Mmhmm ID So if you ti Well You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something PM And it it doesnt have to be strong also ME Nah yeah the feel Right PM Only the feel ID So it it looks pretty but it feels strong PM Oh ME I agree UI And I Then I have some more findings UI Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery UI I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course UI But solar energy is not very practical inside a house because you dont have a have a lot of uh sun UI And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical I think for uh for a simple remote thats a bit oh thats a bit uh Thats a bit uh much ID No titanium UI And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case UI Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium UI That thats the information I received UI If you use the curved case uh a curved case double curved then you cant use titanium ID What do you exactly mean with double curved UI Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look UI And uh now the the shape yeah a curved case UI Um yeah I think uh sort of triangleshaped bottom or something UI Uh a more modern look not plain long box style but Ill draw it but maybe later ID Double curved ME I dunno PM Yeah ID It it mean Yeah well okay PM Yeah UI And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape than if you have uh UI Um anyway Um f as uh for the buttons simple push buttons UI No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that because it makes more complex and expensive UI And uh as we agreed we dont use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device ME Yeah right UI Because it makes it also more complex and expensive UI But we do use an LCD screen so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip which is more complex and expensive UI But Its worth the trouble I think because Uh rubber is a soft material I guess ID Well This soft material thing from uh Yeah PM The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material PM Because people like that ME Yeah UI Uh soft enough PM Yeah ME Right PM Right PM Yeah UI So thats uh basically what I want to talk about ID Alright ID Okay ID We will take that ID And then uh Mike ID Okay PM Yeah PM Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier PM Um an LCD s screen will be implemented PM Um we must decide where this meeting PM Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines PM And um well theyre cheap so we could use them now ID Oh Thats interesting PM Um its not really speech recognition its more um like you can um talk to the chip uh record the message and record an answer and then once you uh talk to the remote then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left PM So if I say hi Mike and you have recorded uh hi Mike back then you will get that UI Oh yeah I understand ME Oh okay UI Yeah ID Okay ME Right ID But you can also say that when you say something it does some function PM No it doesnt does not do anything ME No ID Oh PM But i its just a Yeah its its cheap ID Thats a bit uh Yes ME But that that makes it cheap ME Its its just a an extra function and its cheap UI Yeah ID I understand ID But it has no functionality for our remote at all ME No but Yeah right PM No but thats the gadget they want or the gimmicks UI But it its n nice for young people ME Young people love them PM Yes we we should really uh include that one I think UI They like gadgets ME Yeah ple Right UI Yeah UI If its cheap ID Hmm PM Um Well as I said uh earlier I think the uh LCD screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote UI Yeah PM Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the LCD screen uh instead of uh extra buttons ID So you put a menu in the LCD PM I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that PM Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a well conventional remote I think PM For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable PM A voice recognition can be uh implemented PM And uh I drew an example but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do ME Alright UI Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ME How How How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the LCD screen PM Hmm ID Ah PM Well I have the I can draw it again and I know what I did wrong PM I didnt tick the note bo box in the UI Mm UI Alright PM Um Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen ME Alright ME So you have a menu button and then you can go up and down ID But then we should also have an uh an Okay button ME Yeah right PM Yes PM Um I shall draw this UI button yeah PM If it uh works ID Just uh There is already a blank ID Yes ID So Yeah ME Yeah PM Mm so have I PM Nah ME You have to push hard UI I suggest a banana shape UI Because of the fruity uh fashion ME Yeah ME Yeah ID No m Next year thats out UI Yellow and Yeah alright yeah UI Just a hunch PM Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct ID Yeah UI Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course PM Yeah just uh the numbers UI And then below is the LCD screen PM These these will be bigger in the the real design UI Alright yeah PM This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the LCD screen UI Mmhmm PM And with this you can uh yes go to through the menus and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button because you want it to uh t yeah to use it fast within one uh click ID Yeah ME Youve Right ID Yes ID And whats the menu button ME And you you need a you need a speaker PM Um its Hmm ME For the Yeah PM This button can also be the Menu button we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here but Yeah ID But how did How do you get out of the menu then ID Yeah ID Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay UI Uh by pe pressing the menu button again UI By pressing the menu button again you go uh out ID Uh Yes well but bec because when you push Menu you get in and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice ME Yeah UI Its usual the the the d kind of the way it works UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Ah right UI Yeah PM Well you you No no we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button ID And Well thats also the Okay button UI But you can men you can press menu again to get out ID Thats you you should have uh Or you can put in the LCDs uh window an option Get Out UI No ME Exit ID Exit PM Ah once you have an extra Menu button you dont need that that extra option ID Well its just a choice PM You have uh redundancy ME But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part ME Or dont Right and spea speaker at the back or something PM Yeah if we decide to uh to implement that maybe we should UI Why would you put it uh then and where is the recording uh the microphone UI Where would you put it PM Well they that could be anywhere PM Thats very small PM It could be uh down here UI Uhhuh PM Um PM Well not here PM I yeah I suggest here PM But thats just a little gap UI Microphone yeah PM Yeah PM Well the speaker and the microphone I think are the same uh little hole thingy UI Yeah I understand PM Yeah UI Uh but uh we could uh d do but its perhaps more expensive uh the speaker on the back or something ME Alright PM Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines so they wont be uh very expensive PM But This is my suggested design ID Huh UI Alright ME Alright ID Yeah ID Okay ID Well okay alright PM Um Yes ID Um then lets have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make PM And oh I think as you can see so the LCD screen does look better uh at the lower end or at the bottom ID Id I agree ME Yeah fine PM But Oh um I had some uh examples ID Fine ME Move on UI Well yeah yeah yeah ID Yeah UI I can live with it PM You can uh But I did not like it very much but Well these are quite obvious very ugly remote ID Yes ID Too big ME Yeah UI They do they dont look fruity enough PM Um No well th Yeah ME Nei Theyre n theyre not trendy ID Theyre all black PM Well not all ID Hey that one I like PM Uh this is for children but th No UI Tho Yeah those But it doesnt uh the Yeah ok Yeah ME It doesnt look strong ID No PM W but with the colours i its a bit the way were going to ID The remote ME Yeah right PM Well this is a terrible Um this looks Yeah ID Terrible ME This is just crazy ID Its its all too much buttons UI But it it must not look too childish of course huh ID Too many buttons ID Thats Well thats too expensive I think PM This uh these are the LCD screens PM I think we should if its um possible uh one with colours but I dont know uh Too expensive ME Nah th Its too expensive ME Yeah PM Alright PM Well Nah UI But it Yeah ID Alright ID Yeah ID Okay PM Ha even more ID Huh PM N Well Yeah this is what weve just done ID Mm no ME But are we going for a strange uh form ID Kay ID No not very strange ME Cause people like that UI Not not too strange ME Not too strange UI No ME You can make the the underside you can make it more round where the LCD is ID It still has t Yes ID Th a a kind of bridge ID So it f falls over the hand ME I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms s something like that ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah ME You know ID Well I have at home a remote with a bridge ID Its just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand and thats very nice ID Thats It feels comfortable ME Yeah but people like something uh new you know UI Exotic yeah ME Yeah different UI We have t Yeah yeah ID Yeah UI I will design it we design it later ME Y yis Alright UI So well get to that later I guess ME Great ID Yeah alright ID Um where did I put it UI The specific shape ID Um conceptual phase I think this is it UI The Our sources ID I got this from our friends ID So Uh yeah the conceptual design ID These are a few examples which we have to decide about ID All the the materials from the case uh the electric cable thats all your uh your side of the story ID Um Yeah ME Your bag ID Um now from the user interface your uh package ID Um where No well thats more like the buttons where they have to come ID And um B a bit of yeah well a bit of uh design UI But uh we should decide now ID Yes but we have to decide about these now PM Right PM Ah right ME Yeah ME Materials are the most most impor Yeah ID And uh the trendwatching ID So as you said fruity is in well sells good ID Wow ID Uh these things UI So we have to uh put it in one uh document ID Uh yes ID Um so if we uh go through them Yeah well uh Why should I uh Yeah UI Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document and then uh put the answers after the subjects UI Yeah PM Not everything UI Well we have to decide all these things PM Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine UI W we can uh override them ID So What what kind of properties should it have UI Well a case UI Uh thats me UI Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ID Well we just listened PM I think we Why dont we um use uh titanium or or a hard yeah some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front UI Uh s solid yeah UI Yeah ME Do you know the new uh No no The front is the most important PM That Just like um most cell phones are UI Yeah I understand UI Yeah UI So we have titanium UI Yeah but the nonremovable elements of the of the remote so not the front could be titanium to give that uh strong look PM Yeah ID You know what UI And then the front is made of plastic UI And you can put that on and off and switch it PM Yeah ME But the feel of plastic isnt strong UI No but you have titanium of course PM No but you you have this Yeah UI Uh you have the best of both worlds ME Yeah alright alright ME Kay PM Yeah you have the re remote in your hand like this PM So you feel titanium UI And of course yeah you have the the the plastic front end UI But you also have the titanium ME Yeah ME Fronts are are cheaper than when theyre from plas Yeah but it its expensive PM Yeah UI Yeah of course but yeah you have to make a decision PM And I dont know if you can make steel just any way you want it to UI I guess so UI Uh titanium I sh I think uh Huh PM Yeah ME Bendable ME Bendable UI Well well the According to my sources uh its its totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it if we want PM Well any colour Yeah then you you paint it in the colour you want it ME Yeah UI Mm PM The plastic is is the colour you want it ME Paint spray UI Mm ME Yeah alright PM So Yeah ME So were going for a titanium back and a plastic front ID Alright ID Ive uh Titanium back plastic front UI Yeah I think thats a nice tradeoff PM Mm ID Okay ID Um well I am going to put it in here uh because we can uh look ME Yeah great PM Yeah ID I Um solid feel and trendy look UI Alright ID So material um hard plastic for the front UI Yeah for the front and then titanium for the back ME Yeah UI For the nonremovable uh part ME But then you have the problem when you have a titanium back you cant switch it ME When you want an other colour on the front it doesnt match UI Well but The titan titanium isnt isnt v very Yeah i it doesnt uh curves ME You know PM Well titanium is neutral UI No uh I nei ME I understand UI Titanium is very No no no but you know b Titanium is very basic colour and it doesnt really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front ME Yeah yeah yeah PM Hmm ME Yeah PM Yeah ME Alright UI I dunno if if you disagree but I think its doesnt matter very much PM Well Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours and they dont use uh wood ME Yeah ME Alright UI And even if it does uh doesnt match it will uh People like mm colours that dont match ME Funky customers PM Mm PM Yeah ME Alright ID Okay ID And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh UI Cop copper uh material PM Yeah UI Excuse me PM The electrical cable uh does No we dont use an electrical cable ID Its uh from uh our coffee uh Of course UI Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh Yeah in Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh Oh external PM Yeah inside but this is for the coffee uh machine PM Yeah but thats not whats meant here I think ME Nei ME So external ME Yeah PM Yeah UI Well A coffee grind doesnt have Na ja UI Never mind the coffee grind ID Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work ID So The chip is normal silicon UI Right ID Uh the buttons are normal etcetera ID Okay UI Alright ID So thats just easy UI Mmhmm ID Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes ID The conceptual specification of the user interface ID Um well we have our beautiful drawing PM Well I got a better one here and I will um The shared folder ME Alright ID Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder and then Ill put it in our end report PM I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting ID Yes you can Mm yeah ID You can uh put some uh which button is what PM Yeah yeah yeah ID Okay ID Um the trendwatching included these days ID And what do we ID We thing that fruit and bright colours are Yes UI Yeah the the the front w Mmhmm ME I think we can launch a couple of packages ME You can buy a different kind of of of machine but its the same thing but with another front PM Yeah ME So And you can you can Yeah right ID We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot PM Yeah thats the whole idea of the front UI Yeah UI Yeah ID Uh those kind of things PM Yes PM But thats for later on PM The fronts y you can do anything with them ID Yeah ME Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini Yeah PM Yeah right For the uh initiative uh launch UI For the for the launch yeah ME Its good marketing PM Mm ID Launch different lines at once UI So e th then a c couple of basic colours UI Not not very uh sim Not Yeah ME Yeah n not too heavy ME You can always take another pick ID We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time ME They have to buy it later on PM Oh yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah right PM Yeah UI Yeah ID Come on ME More basic ID We still have to make those fifty million yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah UI Very boring yeah PM Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more UI The most boring fronts possible ID The most ugly ME Yeah right ID Two UI Yeah but you you can have some basic colours and then we come with the special patterns on them and and uh And uh Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design PM Yeah PM Red red blue and green you give them or something and then you can give them uh other ones ID Yeah ME Yeah ID Yeah ID Alright ID Um well the buttons etcetera we get from Mike ID Uh this fruit and bright colours yeah well I think well have to in the next uh half an hour well have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch when we uh well introduce our remote UI Because yeah we have the sketch but Alright yeah ME Yeah ME But we we must remember that fancy lookandfeel is the most important thing ID Yes ME Else it w wont sell ME So Lost my mouse ID Yes ID Well Ill have to before I get another warning for five minutes Im going to get Where is my mouse ID Uh where is my mouse ID Oh yeah ID Um this is it ME Unbelievable ID Well um this we have ME Yeah ID Uh basic stuff ID Interface we have ID Supplements LCD ID Maybe a a cheap voice recording ID Well Yes PM Yeah we should do that UI The price ID Alright ID Individual actions UI We all agree on that UI Yeah PM Mm ID Industry designer ID User Interface Mike ID Youre going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard PM Yeah we can do that UI Together or uh Yeah together ME Yeah togeth You can take the SMARTboard UI How Yeah yeah but how do I Some Some non functional tasks ID Thats what I got uh to hear PM But bu we stay we stay here or something ID Yes well well get it to hear that I think ID But I think so ID Th theyre saying SMARTboard and thats it This is the SMARTboard so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype and y Well thats includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera PM Ah right PM And take it to our rooms and uh Ah specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach ID Yeah ID So youll get it on your em on your laptop ID Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation ME Have fun ID So um what are you going to do ME Kay ID Uh I dont know what product evaluation exactly means but uh youll get uh the specifications ME We dont have produ product yet so kind of difficult ID Yeah ID Thats why I uh But uh How long do we still have UI Youre fired UI No but Well can we talk about something else UI Uh Uh no I dont know anything but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah ID Yeah PM Yeah ME Ajax PM Um Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ME Nah ME Um round UI Round I think ME Yeah PM Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah ME Round UI To make it as uh as round as possible PM And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangleish shaped with a square one in the middle ID Why does Ah f fuck you ME Curvy ME Yeah ME So you can see you have to up or down PM Yeah PM Yeah UI But now I see the Well th th th th th that depends uh ME And this must be uh volume I think and this programme ID Heh PM Mm PM Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume I think ID We cant get Ts It doesnt work any more ME Yeah PM Yeah it depends but If you turn up the volume you always see this thingy go up UI Well we uh We we j well just give them an uh Well design it and then they can give comments on it ME Yeah thats right PM Yeah PM Yeah alright ME Yeah ME Okay ID We cant save them ID So well just have them uh standing there ME Yeah I noticed ME You cant uh click the corners ID No ID Its a bit uh bit a pity ME Its a real real great thing ID Well we still have uh more than five minutes ID Um So what are we going to do ID I as Project Manager ha dont have a clue ME Lets start the design ID Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote UI Well yeah PM Mm UI Um I think um a logo our company logo and the slogan should be or could be Yeah why not ID Also the slogan ID On the We put the fashion in electronics UI If theres enough space you can put uh Well well Well our slogan is not very long PM Uh I Id say only the logo ME O Yeah ME Me too PM Too much text and it gets too too busy UI Its just a simple What is it PM Well its quite a long phrase ID We put the fashion in electronics ME But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts UI You c But you can put it on the back on the titanium part ME So Yeah right UI The logo and the and the Yeah they do PM Ah the logo should be on the top I think ME The logo Yeah ID On the top ID Yeah ID Well in in in the right top corner UI Well yeah PM Right corner yes ID And well you c On the back you can put uh h At the bottom you can put the logo with the Yeah UI Right corner or maybe here in the middle PM uh the text PM Yeah ME But the logo the logo shouldnt be exchangeable when you get off the front ID Just just small PM Uh yeah at the back UI Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board and you can remove the front PM Well you c Well uh Yes ID Yeah well Carved into the material ME Yeah PM You can The logo can be on on every uh front ME Yeah ME Yeah but you can scratch it off or something ME Its better if you have it uh Yeah PM Yeah but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something ID No you you can carve it into the titanium at the back UI I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing UI But am I the only one or uh No not on the front but on the backside PM Yeah on the backside ID Well management would like it PM Well n n not not on the front side I think ID The front side no no l no slogan PM On the back Yes you you can yeah push that in so that it is always be there UI Uh I think its a nice idea to make it more recognisable that the next to the logo you have the slogan ID Sorry PM Yeah ME I agree UI To make more uh of an impression ME But not too big ME Just uh Yeah UI Not too big UI No very small UI Not on the entire back but uh just very small UI But readable enough of course ME Okay ID Yes slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh UI But well uh well take that uh with us into the design PM Yeah I think over here the logo UI Lo Uh yeah UI Or maybe here in the middle but well decide later ID Hmm ID Uh when changing fronts ID Alright thats decided UI Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ID Five minutes left UI O on the front UI Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium the front is the the upper part and the the bit with the with the LCD screen PM Yes we could No they have two fronts that UI So Yeah ID So a bit of titanium between ME Yeah UI No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front two fronts that This enti entire bottom ID Thats a bit Oh that thats thats pretty cool ME No no no no ME You have to make this titanium too PM You you can Yeah ID No PM Yeah ME Else you you get problems with the LCD PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Yes ME Like dust in it and so things like that PM Yeah ME When you exchange all the fronts and its open ID I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile PM No you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something UI And then the lower part is titanium PM This is titanium UI I think thats nice yeah ME Yeah PM And this is uh F front ME Some some kind of wei weight in it ID Yeah ME Yeah ID Round forms UI Yeah UI I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone PM Yeah ME Yeah PM With the with the curved edge ID Yep UI Maybe you can show it PM Yeah UI It also has the those two distinct uh Mm bit like this PM Yeah PM Tada PM Yeah ID Yeah ME Yeah you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is UI Uh its uh Yeah yeah ME Because it has to be uh there all the time you know ID What PM Ah UI That uh Yeah ID So round where ME So uh a little corner of titanium UI Maybe a nice touch yeah PM Yeah thats nice finishing touch you need ID Oh yeah ID Yes that also sounds uh pretty uh neat ME So this this is the exchangeable part UI I think Im going to buy it ID We want it PM Yeah this is the front ID And its only f twenty five Euros ID Come on PM This is the My design UI Thats a bit too much but No no no no but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually ID No thats nothing ID The Phillips remote uh costs more UI Of course because its my design but No our d our design alright ME Right ME Taking all the credit ID Well uh you two are going to work together ID Youll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop and then uh you uh Well I think we can I just Its Yeah o Oh Oh we have a one PM Yeah PM Well stay here I guess ME But theres a problem ME We cant uh take a blank one ME Or can we PM Well we can uh erase an animal I guess ME Yeah PM Uh the fourth one ME Nah thats alright thats alright UI But dont erase my cat PM Uh the fourth one is empty isnt it PM Yeah UI I want to preserve it ME This one is empty PM Yeah ME You have to empty one huh UI What are you doing chief ID So you can uh draw a Yeah ME Alright PM Yeah I think we have to wait ID Well Ill get a Ill get the message UI Yeah until the until the beep goes ME No Yeah UI But I dont uh Do we have to stay here or I think we have to return first ID No I think uh Well youll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here PM Maybe ID Or get your mouse ID Because its little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates UI The high powers from above will have to tell us yeah ME Yeah ME Its not relaxing ID I always have a mouse next to my laptop ID I hate these Ugh ME I I dont have a laptop UI Yeah touchpads yeah UI We can uh do a touchpad on our remote ME Yeah right UI No just kidding PM Yeah ME Dream on UI Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too because it becomes too too too too stressy ID And in your remote control ID So we put a touch pad on it and say ha ha PM Aha PM This has no function ME Half No ID Yeah ID We know youll youll youll hate it but But they do want some gadgets UI But uh th youth doesnt care about functio functionality so Yeah ME Its all about cool things ID So thats wha what were doing ME And it will sell ME We will be rich UI Bless you ID Well we wont ID Our bosses will be rich UI Mm PM Weve done too much in the previous meetings UI Too much PM Yes weve got nothing to do now UI Well they uh I think thats good ID Well thats not bad is it ME No UI We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing on most uh on things ID Mm PM Its the best remote ever ID So Oh PM Pinball ID Oh hes totally off again ID Well But when I start here its here ME No man ME You just have to push harder UI Yeah you have to push harder UI Mm ID So is it Nope ME Yeah PM Yes but you you get really close to the screen with your hand and I dont think thats Hmm ME Mm ME Recalibrate it UI Wheres the good old chalk board with the the green board with the how do you call it chalk yeah ME Yeah PM We can better uh draw a design on this UI Yeah maybe PM Yeah but we cant UI Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated we can draw a thing quick and then before it uh goes off again ID Yeah ID Lets go PM Well Well stay here ME Finish meeting now ID Finish the meeting now ID Alright now we know what to do so Um Message ME Yeah ME Oh PM Or well get the email UI Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ID No get away UI Huh UI Yeah PM Yeah UI Guess so ID Um I Im not sure ID Maybe you Yeah ID Well youll have to work on this one PM Well well wait a few seconds and then well get an email ID Yeah ID Thats a good idea ME Alright ME Have fun lads ID Well Good luck PM Yeah UI A happy hol happy holidays,"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. The team drew a provisional prototype. They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched."
ID Uh fourth meeting PM We have to do what ID Some extra deciding UI W what UI Alri alright PM Oh ID Well Ill show you the notes again UI Well see ID Very interesting ID Well youll you two will uh present us your prototype UI Yeah ID Then um I guess thats your bit ME Yeah ID I I didnt s see anything about it so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that ID So the youre uh ID Ill show you how were going to do with financing this uh design PM Mm UI Yeah thats important too UI Yeah ID And then well evaluate after after we have redesigned it PM Bit late ID Because uh well well see about the costs ID Um well uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close UI Alright ID Well the finance uh well do later so um firstly uh Ill show you the notes ID I dont think its very interesting PM I think it is ID Oh nei ID Uh no ID Alright ID This is copy paste ID So Of course UI From me of course yeah ID You had some very strange layout UI Well from us all yeah from all of us UI Yeah UI Its a nice chorus yeah ID Well um We ge we went through the agenda and well we had some uh some presentations from you three ID And uh I summarised what you said to us ID So uh I dont think its very interesting and go through it again UI Repeat it yeah ID So uh This is what we decided UI Alright ID Its also copy paste from what we made together ID So we still know that ME Okay ID And then uh we can we can uh use the time better ID Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us UI Alright we both uh will ID Yeah UI Or one of us will PM Alright UI Uh Alright PM No you go and Ill uh supplement you UI If I make mistakes uh youll uh Right PM Yeah ID Correct UI Uh well this is our design UI Uh its pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting UI With uh the different uh perspectives of it UI Uh well begin uh with the front UI We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape UI Um with uh the upper part being the front UI Th So theres this part um which is made of hard plastic the front UI And uh were were using different colours UI Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours and later well put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything ID Yeah ID Mmhmm UI But basically different colours bright colours not black too dark UI Fancy colours UI Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device UI Uh which is of course um part of the back actually because its also titanium UI You can see it also on the on the on the side view that only this part is the front and the rest of it the under uh the under side uh of it yeah the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium and has the titanium colour of course the look UI Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back part of the titanium uh titanium part ID Mm PM Yeah its a double R but Its a double R UI Yeah UI Its a double R UI Yeah the logo Uh uh its difficult to draw so small but its our double R uh logo is in there PM But its very difficult to to draw that in Yeah ID Yeah alright ID Okay ID Yeah UI Um so thats the logo in the upper lef uh right corner UI Then we have the buttons UI Uh its difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons PM Oval yeah ID Alright UI So uh oval n those are here UI And then we have the m The m Yeah the the con the the the yeah the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here PM Channel up and volume UI Um um with kind of arrow shapes which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons UI And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on UI We have the Okay button UI Oh nei we uh the Okay buttons here in the middle of the of the operators of the channel and uh volume um changers PM Yeah ID Mmhmm UI And then weve here the Menu button and the And the video button ID Alright PM Menu for the LCD screen UI The Yeah ME Mm right ID So Kay UI And of course this low part this is the LCD screen UI Uh this is what we made of it UI You can make uh suggestions uh if you want ID Well if I look at it the side the side view Oh yeah alright PM Well at the back Yeah UI Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions UI Maybe I I dont want to I dont want to suppress you but n Ill uh finish this uh quick ID Yeah UI Um okay Ive had everything I guess on the front PM No the back PM With the logo and our uh l uh No I dont think And the And about the side view um This the front wont be as thick but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Well it wont be visible UI Yeah the back UI Yeah UI We thought about Yeah uh the back is of course totally titanium UI And we thought about the logo big in the middle ID Mmhmm UI Just so again the double R UI We have then the logo on front and on the back ME Mmhmm UI Maybe thats too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way ID Okay UI And the company slogan we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo ID Yeah ME Yeah UI Thats basically what we were thinking about and Oh and uh before I forget ID Okay ID W Well I see but Well UI Yeah the the voice of course the voice recorder is uh at the bottom ID Yeah I see it ID Yes UI And you can record it uh using yeah the the the back of the f w device ID When I look at uh when I look at this side view I think w when I have that in my hand its terrible PM Mm ID If if you look if if this this is thick and this is thin th th then it that it lies over your hands UI Why UI Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand mean uh the the the the In the middle in the Thats the question ID But Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker so th then it falls over your hands PM Yeah ME Yeah I agree PM If y If you handle a remote you you usually dont have your hand straight like this PM You you have it a bit uh Yeah ME It depends on the size ME If its kinda small this is is great ME But if its its larger then you want to grab it ID And how large is it PM Yeah ME Yeah thats the question UI Uh well Yeah UI H What do you suggest I mean we do UI This was Mikes prototype and y you seemed to agreed on it ID Well uh Well the sides I havent seen yet uh UI But now you have a totally different PM Well they lay there all the time UI The size UI Yeah well the size doesnt really matter w I mean Side ID They the the the the the side view we didnt uh Yeah UI Uh oh the side UI W we we he drew the s the side but you d you werent paying attention as usual PM Yeah yeah UI Well any case well discuss it now UI Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea ME Yeah I agree with the LCD screen ME You have it in your palm like this and you can watch uh watch the screen ME And if you have it li in the middle your hand might be over it UI But you you hold it like this PM Yeah you you dont you dont grab it you you Yeah UI Youre not holding it like this or something UI You yeah y How do you call it UI Yeah UI Well y y y you dont have it like this UI You have it more like this ID No no no UI You you youre using buttons this way or if youre righthanded this way ME Like youre holding your telephone ID Yep UI So you Yeah ME Because if you have a screen on it you wanna look at your screen UI So Yeah well And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher so Well Well the the Well thats a reason to to to put the LCD screen uh of course on the upper side but If necessary PM Hmm PM That way it it falls into your hand PM I think ID Okay ME Yeah I agree on this ME No I dont think so ME Thats not uh the point And you might be uh You might be target customer PM No but but Well f for as far as I can see three of us agree and only Nils But youre the Project Manager you can make the hard decisions ID Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then thats it ID Yes ID So uh I c I c Well well we well do it like this UI But uh are d Can you live with it UI Uh Y Yeah y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable PM Yeah ID Alright if you think that thats the way it should No No when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh No not totally UI But do you But d you dont think this is completely unusable I guess UI I think UI Not totally well Yeah but of course y you are also human ID For me I I wouldnt buy it ID Lets say it like that UI We have to take uh every everyone into account ID No Yes but Yeah we dont know but thats uh thats thats thats more market research UI So Yeah UI Well uh who who else thinks like you PM Mm UI We dont know UI Maybe a thousand people or a million people ID So let it be like this at uh at this moment UI Let it be UI Alright ID Okay UI So thats that UI Uh any other suggestions ID No I think its great ME Yeah PM But what about the redesigning ID Comes to that later PM Okay ID Um you ID Uh c You can uh Walter UI Youre very personal again ID You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ME Alright ME Great ID Thats more useful than just speaking ME Well this is just a short intro ME Im going to do uh the ev evaluation ID Yes ME Thats gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria ME So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends ID Mmhmm ME And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly ME Well I put some questions in a Word file ME See if I can find them ME Uh uh uh uh mm ID Kay ME Well I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation so uh I dont have to explain it PM Hmm ME Uh the first question is uh is the device goodlooking ME Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly ME Seventy five percent of them ME So what do we think UI Well d we designed it so of course we are very Yeah PM Mm ID Yeah were were not quite uh objective about this ME Yeah No I know but I have to uh evaluate it PM Well we designed it to be goodlooking ME So I have to take this questionnaire UI So and we ha we have answer now ID To the customers ID To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ME Yeah Yeah but I cant can s Yeah but uh you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect UI Yeah ID Nei ID Oh no PM Hmm ID I know I know I know ID But um Well we can go uh because of the time uh pretty quick through this ID Uh do we find it goodlooking ID Well we think so UI I Yeah I think it Well l well lets start with the beginning just one by one ID Uh Yeah PM Yeah PM We designed it to be goodlooking so Hmm ME So But we have to be critic critical about it ME And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end ME So we we know where we stand ID Well one ME Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten ID Well so its point four ME Right so Right ID Easy to find t Two ME Uh is it goodlooking UI Well I guess uh I think uh its uh its its um pointed towards the youth of course uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything UI That was our target audience of course UI But its also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess UI Uh its its not f a device that Yeah thats thats uh for older people its its more that classical look ME The titanium might be uh f for older people ME It you put uh put a black front on it or something UI So Uh no UI I think Yeah they like black of course but I think theyll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think its also good for them so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people UI So I think its very goodlooking and not only for youth uh young people ME Right PM I think we shouldnt discuss any points points that long because I dont know how how many points there are but uh Yeah ME Right ID No ID I totally agree UI Yeah the fourteen yeah ID We we have to get get on go through this ME Right a number please PM Yeah UI Is it easy to t change channels UI Yeah well I think so ME So the last one is seven ME Easy to change channels PM Um no its uh With two huge buttons ID No not false ID Its one ME Oh sorry ME Yeah right ID Well uh two ME Change channels ID Y Well we have to go through it UI I think its uh as easy as uh can be made UI Uh So I Yeah ME Right UI You How can you make it any easier ME The power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible UI Yeah huge is a Yeah ID Yep ID Two ME Two ME Alright ME The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ID Well no UI D we d we dont we dont have uh that s Yeah ID We didnt implement anything about that PM Well its easier to find than a a normal black one or something because of the colour PM But We have so few functions so Yeah ID Well six then ME Yeah ME Six ME Right UI Well we dont have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so but um um Yeah ID Are the functions easy to learn ID Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an And the device RSI sensitive ME Yeah I agree PM Well I should I think two because the voice recorder is n not self learning ID Yeah ID Ah ME Yeah UI Yeah ME Alright UI Mm ME Two ID Yeah but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming ME Yeah Yeah I agree UI Are we take too much time ID Uh not not towards you but towards this all ME No ID Th this is We you have to put it to the customers ME Yeah ME Right R RSI sensitive ME RSI sensitive ID Uh well well a bit so four ME Four ME Um Yeah ID Yes UI Yeah very much UI One ID One ID And features included also one ID And One ID Uh those uh nine uh is the fancylooking ID Uh we still think so UI Yeah ID Device fancy feeling UI And I think fancyfeeling too because of the titanium back ID Yeah cool man PM Yeah UI Yeah ME Right ID Are there enough technology ID Yeah well also we have two PM Yeah ME Yeah thats great ID Is the device easy to use PM The Two two ID Yes we have not many buttons UI So well maybe two because of the voice recorder ME Well with the uh Three ID Two three PM T Yeah ID Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented UI F Yeah ID Well in our covers in our fronts ID So yes one UI One or two ID Is the material attractive PM One or two another two UI Yeah ME Nah f four I think UI Four ME If you look at this No UI Well it doesnt really resemble any fruit uh thats true UI But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course ID Oh okay PM Well three ME Three alright ID Okay UI And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it ME Yeah thats true ID Is the material attractive ME But Right PM Mm ID Well the titanium is strong and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft PM Yeah ID So I would say at least two ID Okay ID Well Yeah PM This is the last meeting ID Yes but we we have to design much more because there was some irritating account manager coming to me ME The average will uh come later PM Yeah UI I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly ID Um Oh UI There had to be some kind of trouble along the way ID Uh Yes PM Yeah ID Well look at the costs at this point UI My god ID I had to fit it in ME It has to go to twelve right ID I twelve and a half ME Twelve and a half ID So Well what costs a lot ID The sample spea costs four UI The what UI The Yeah w tha thats uh thats a bit an optional option ID The sample speaker the s sensor ME Out ME Thats easy ME Kick it out ID Kick it out PM The what ME Yeah ID We have to go to twelve and a half ME The speaker ID The speaker costs far by far the most PM Oh ME Thats some wrong info man ID It it isnt worth it UI No ME No UI No d th No ID We could make two different versions one with and one without ME Its uh Its just extra ID But for this So zero ME Kick it out UI Yeah ID Then we go to fourteen point six ME What more ID Well the titanium I dont want to lose actually UI No ME Batteries are uh quite Uh no no no no ID LC three ID Yeah hand dynamo ID Y t come on w a remote control has a battery PM Um Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip UI N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think UI Because uh the LCD screen ID Well be for the LCD uh you had said UI Yeah PM Yeah ME Hmm PM Cant we do that with a regular chip UI No PM Why not UI Because uh that uh y because my information says it ID Well what whats the difference between simple and regular UI Huh ID Whats the difference between a simple and a regular chip PM Yeah PM Regular is normal ME Yeah ID And simple UI Uh well yeah I I read something about it but Yeah I I read something about it but it wasnt very clear PM Simple ID Nothing PM Elementary ID Well ID Your part UI I d I didnt in include it in my report ID What happens if we do How much do we win UI Single Well you have to use a chip UI So Well you have to use the advanced chip if you have the LCD screen PM We we we Why ID One PM We have very little options furthermore for the Uh well we have to put that in UI But if you have a regular chip you cant have the LCD screen ID Yeah ME Yeah we need to have the the LCD screen UI That thats a fact ID Well we could say well this special colour that isnt that that isnt there because the the fronts they will buy it UI Uh Yeah but its only one half ME No Yeah but No thats n Its not relevant ID The special colour PM Nah UI Uh it d it doesnt But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen ID Yeah then you s then you only have one half left PM Yeah you must change the chip uh back PM You must change the chip back Nils ME Yeah ID Uh yeah ME No Then the whole concept is uh You You can make you can make it cheaper UI Yeah I know but thats what my information says UI I di I didnt uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun PM Hmm PM No we oh You you we have an advanced chiponprint and we have an LC display UI You have to use it ME But if you dont sell No no no no ID Yeah PM I think thats a bit double ID Yeah PM Y we dont need both ID No the advanced chip is needed to have an LCD display UI For the LCD screen UI Yeah UI Yeah PM Says ID Says his Uh that was in the second meeting I think UI Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again UI Because we you have uncurved Yeah ID Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved uh he because uh I thought its a b a bit cheaper already PM I ID We can also make it flat UI Well But what what did what do n Sorry but What do they mean with the curves ID But Curved UI Is th Is this a curve ID Yes thats curved UI One curve UI Yeah this is actually two curves yeah ID Yes UI Its how you Its how you look at it ID No its one curve PM One curve ID One curve simple UI Well then we have a huge problem I think UI W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half ID We have a big financial problem PM Well we make it more expensive to buy ID Well then we have two dollars less profit ID Come on if we if we if we make this fifty million they wont hesitate to uh congratulate us so uh By the way we also have this one ME If if you make people brandaware they are willing to pay more ME But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back UI But uh I Hey but uh I think youll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen its its very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing ME If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy PM Yeah or we could replace it Why why dont we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium uh titaniumcoloured plastic ME If you if you make it cool to have Oh thats just great ID Oh costs nothing ME Oh alright ID Thats nice ID Plastic is Yes but I just got it UI Well thats pretty uh l N not very practical ME That is pretty stupid UI Well But Im n I dont agree ID Who ID You want to dump the titanium PM Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper ID And make all plastic then we ha then were there PM But then we weve got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again UI I think I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that ID Th then you have a ugly stupid l ugly looking dumb remote that that noone would buy PM Ah no no PM Its not ugly looking PM The looks remain the same ID No I dont think so ME Y Yeah I agree PM Well I do think so ID Yes ID And the feel and th that it is strong and We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group but not lose the one Why cant I Ill put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for thats trendy d these days PM feel UI And because i Alright its not our target audience but its its useful if its uh important for old people UI Yeah UI I think the titanium is very important PM Yeah alright but then we we wont get there UI Yeah we have a problem yeah UI W But you can better yeah dump the LCD screen then PM We can dump the special colour PM We l we use plastic PM And plastic is already in colour I think ME I dont think you should dump the LCD screen UI Well what else UI W I mean uh Yeah PM No nothing ME Or you shou Its Or change the titanium or dump the LCD screen PM Amen ME But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the LCD screen PM Yeah ME Because you have lots of functions in it too UI Yeah well yeah PM Yeah UI Alright UI I agree with that PM But No no no no UI So we u we use uh Unfortunately UI Um UI Titaniumcoloured plastic ME Yeah I agree UI So titaniumcoloured plastic for the back ID I Ill talk to the managers PM W Titanium stays there ID Titanium I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote UI Yeah this is good but it its not good enough ME Osl If you dont have the money you cant make it ID But Ah those those account managers what do th d what do they know UI So we have to use the ditch the titanium Im afraid PM Well No because we did not know anything about it ID Come on UI What do we Well what do we know ID Riot UI All we want is a is a fancy design but we dont really consider the costs ID Yes yes UI So Yeah al alright yeah ID One and a half Euros UI But we have to deal with it now ID Hmm ME So s If you dont have the money you cant make it UI So So Titanium gone and add plastic ME So this is too expensive ID So ME So we have to make it cheaper ME Right PM Yeah but then weve got money left UI And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ID Well no its just uh all plastic UI No No yeah well Oh six ID Well alright ID Huh UI A lot of plastic yeah ME Its just free man ID Four ID So But then we can add the special colour UI No two for the to make it clear PM Yeah ID As we have money over uh left PM Yeah ID And we still have money left PM W Well I think uh the case is double curved then ID What do we want guys UI I want gold plating UI No no um We have we have to uh fill W we ha No no no but th thats not f um Well you can you can double curve if you dont have titanium ME Yeah right ME I want chrome ID Yes PM Because you y have that curve and you have that curve ID Y Oh no PM Yeah well uh Well y we have curves in all directions ME Well th that that is the problem ID Alright ID Safe UI And that we dropped so it it can be done ID So alright UI But its pretty funny UI We we do want to reach twelve point five UI But it isnt bad to to to stay at eleven ID Finance PM I mean this this aint titanium but it looks like it UI We get more salary if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half ID Well guys ME Yeah ID Guys ID We have to dump our titanium and well hate the managers for that but now were going to evaluate our project of uh project project ME Shoot UI Objection PM Pro project ID Well satisfaction on for example are we satisfactory about our creativity UI Well I cant get no satisfaction but uh I think its uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best yeah ME Yeah ID I think its terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment PM Yeah PM Yeah ME Yeah me too ID Thats really bad UI Its its uh ridiculous actually but Which isnt very practical but thats the way ID But that that thats that yeah thats a reason but also for our creativity PM And uh unrealistic ID We had um nice design and then you get the cost and you had to dump all your creativity PM Well we we we used our creativity but we just had to adapt it to the costs ME Right ID Yeah PM Nei PM Uh no ID Well alright UI Uhhuh ID Uh leadership next PM Terrible ID Uh teamwork ME Leadership PM Leadership ME Well its It was very democratic PM Well Yeah ID Uh yeah well I think so also PM Yeah ID I al I Ive uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time so Well the managers were terrible ME Yeah yeah ID So with their all their useless requirements ID But o alright the teamwork UI Well uh they they didnt think of the requirements UI Its the requirements of the user uh I guess ID No they said oh we wont d uh we wont uh use teletext uh we wont use the DVD UI Yeah UI Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications ID Alright teamwork ME Well Yeah think so too ID Well great I think PM Right yeah ID Uh well what do you what did you think about the SMARTboard UI It was a complete disaster UI No Uh it it it uh it is uh No its other way around ME Yeah I dont like it ID Well Its also a Its both the SMARTboards PM No thats a SMARTboard and thats a digital pen ME Yeah PM Or not UI Thats the SMARTboard UI Thats the digital panel ID I liked this

television PM Oh theyre both SMARTboards ID No ME You u you use the Yeah but you ca This is just a beamer function ID Its both a SMARTboard but this one is used for a desktop and that one is used to to draw ME And here on this one you can uh draw the pictures and things like that ID Well wi w which one did you like ME But That one UI Yeah UI Left or right PM Yeah ID That one ME That one isnt accurate ME It just doesnt work ID Yeah ME You can Yeah but I think theres a big distinction between the these th I dont need a SMARTboard PM But I I think this is meant by the digital pen ID Yes ID Th that is so UI Well I didnt use uh Nei It its much m But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now PM Yeah ID Were now talking about the SMARTboards PM Well we we used that one and we needed it ME Yeah but give me a beamer PM I think ME Thats uh thats much uh much cheaper PM Yeah alright but Yeah I like that one but that one is terrible ID Or install a laptop to a beamer or have this one standing here in an I I like it ME Right ID Okay alright UI Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing ID Yeah ME Yeah ID Yeah it is UI The simple uh sch school board ID So And uh the digi the digital pen ME I agree ID Did uh did you like that one ME No UI I I didnt use it UI I wrote things down but I didnt import it into my laptop ID I used it uh just to check it out

our accountants ME Do that ID Yeah thats a nice title ME Yeah UI But we couldnt yeah ME Very catching ID Oh UI Well I th Yeah ME Im sure management would like that PM Shes on the move ME Oh thats just great,"The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. After the presentation, the product was evaluated. This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design. Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings)."
ID So welcome ID The first kickoff meeting ID What shall we do ID First the opening then the rest ID What are we going to do ID We m have to make a new remote control ID It has to be original trendy and userfriendly ID So we will get back th on that ID First we have to make a functional design ID After that we have to make a conceptual design and then after that a detailed design ID So well discuss that later ID First we have a look at ID So first to we have to make a small painting ID What have do we have to do ID First you can save the documents ID We have to do that every time we make something ID You can print it ID No ID And we have to use the pen and the eraser ID So Now ID We all have to use this one ID You have to make your own favourite animal ID So Ill make an example ME Yep ID First dont touch that things ID You can use the pen ID And then you can make um something UI Nice ID Um you can change some things ID Um format line and change it ID And you can change the colour UI An elephant ID So thats it ID So So and after it you have to save it ME Okay ID Now we can make a new one ID You have to paint now ME Oh ID So youre next UI Kay ME Well we will try ME Where it going PM Hmm PM Thats uh strange ID What is going on UI popups ID What are you What ME Hmm UI What is this Pictionary ME Uh Mm ID Um Is a It is a It is a A duck UI Uh a bird UI Bird ME So Now save UI Yeah ID Yes ID Hmm ME Now uh blank ID Blank yes PM Yeah ME Yeah ID Okay next one PM Okay PM Lets try this UI Whoo PM Uh Um ME Yeah yeah PM Mmhmm PM Mm UI Oh not UI Oh ID Oh UI Okay UI Okay UI Yeah UI No problem UI Shit happens ME Im not getting anything uh on my screen now ME Okay UI A parrot ME Wow UI Ish ME Oh UI He did it before PM Uh No no PM Yeah PM Okay ME Nice UI Oh ID Very good PM Uh blank UI Thank you ID Okay ID Very good ID So um you can always go back ID So Thats it ID So that was two ID Now next ID The budget ID The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros ID And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it ID So now we have to think about what we will make ID First I wanna hear from you ID Uh what are your experiences with remote controls ID So F first UI Uh I will start UI Uh Big one they are uh not easy to use UI Um I have one set and uh a remote control when I dropped it uh it broke UI So that wont be uh our goal I think PM No UI And uh g big buttons m uh thats easier to use than uh I think UI Not all the small buttons you dont know Big buttons positive ID Is this positive or negative that uh big buttons ID Positive UI All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control you wont know what theyre working for ID Okay ID What are your experiences PM Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that its it it has an influence on the TV set PM And that it controls the channels and the the volume ID Mm PM And uh I I I think its positive if theres a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote PM So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it PM And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light and uh and you see that its working PM And uh yeah PM Uh Yeah but No no no ID So and do they always have that PM But I my my experience is that it it its convenient to have that ID Its easy to you PM Yeah ID Okay PM Yeah ID Kay ME Uh at home we have a TV a video uh recorder a DVD player and a satellite receiver ME We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that UI Thank you ME Thats not really ea easy UI Help also ME So it would be nice if we have one for all UI Thank you ME And we also had a remote control for our radio set ME But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it and you didnt know which one was what ME And it was uh uh v not easy to use ME So we n barely used it ID Okay so they have too much ID So next PM Hmm ID For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it ID So what ideas do you have for it for the new remote control ID What what does it have to have UI The weight UI Not not too heavy ID Not too heavy UI Not much buttons ID Yes ID Yeah UI Bustfree UI That when you drop it it wont break UI Like uh some kind of rubber on it UI Or hard uh hard plastic UI Uh buttons not too small UI Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control sometimes it happen ID Yes UI Uh it between the couch and you cant find it UI When you push a but a button on the TV then you hear some uh some sort of bleep ID Like a phone UI And then you uh hey there theres remote control ME Yeah ID Okay PM Yeah ID So thats UI Next PM Yeah well thats that are good ideas PM Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner that that indicates that its working PM If you push a button PM Um Yeah PM And looking on the budget not too expensive uh material PM So probably plastic or something PM Uh Mm no ID Okay ME Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view it also has to look nice ME Or you wont sell it ID Yes ME And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have ME And it should work with as many uh as possible of them ID Okay ID This is It has to be compatible with other things ME Yes ID Okay UI I have one more idea UI Just popped up ID Yes UI Uh it it wont take a lot of batteries UI So you dont wont have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks ID No battery use ID So more ideas ID No okay ID Its only the first ideas ID So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour ID Uh Okay ID Next meeting half an hour ID Um what you have to do ID Well look on your ID And Next instructions youll get in your email ID So This is the first meeting ID See you later in half an hour PM Yes UI Okay ME Okay UI Thank you,"For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries."
ID Okay ID So welcome back ID What do do we have to do ID So first ID I want to say Im the secretary so I make the minutes ID You find them in your in the map in the From the group ID Theres the minutes from the first meeting ID Youll find the next minutes also there ID Then I wanna hear from you what youve done ID And after that I have some new product requirements ID So And after that we have to make decisions what we will do ID And then were ready ID We have forty minutes for this meeting ID After that well have lunch ID So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did UI Thats my task ID So Yeah on your computer or the Whats the name UI Okay UI Uh Ive Where have I put it UI My Documents or not UI Hmm UI Ive save it on my computer my presentation UI But where UI Uh uh uh It was about the working of the remote control ID Whats the name of it ID Its the technical function or the functional requirements UI Nope UI Not a of Wait UI The working design UI But Ive saved it ID Working design UI But now I dont know where it is UI Hmm ID Working design ID What is this ID Product documents UI Yeah UI And I import this until One more ID On the desktop ID Up ID up ID Up ID Up ID Up ID Yes ID My Documents ID Nope UI What the fuck is this ID Gone ID Well you Um Nah ID Nah nah nah ID PowerPoint ID Working design UI Yeah thats the empty one ID And Presentation of working design UI I had one UI Uhhuh UI Open it UI Okay here it is ID Save as ID Uh its Project ME Desktop UI Project ME Yeah ID Save UI Okay ME Okay ID Very good ME Well UI A little later but here it is ID Okay ID So Now have ten minutes to tell it UI So okay UI Its a little difficult what Im gonna tell you UI Its about the working of the remote control UI I just had an half an hour j to study it and I dont get it ME Make it UI Ten minutes to tell it UI Okay UI I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings what I discovered about the remote control ID Okay UI The working bout it uh of it UI Uh then Ill have uh some kind of map and its the top of the remote control UI With a little bit of science uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes UI And then uh what Ill think about it UI First the findings UI The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who havent seen a remote control uh inside UI Uh theres a lot of uh plastic on it um because its uh not so expensive UI And there are uh a lot of uh wires uh which um connect the components in it the battery and there are um switches and things like that UI Theres a lot of small uh electronics UI So it wont be um uh too expensive to build it UI Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it UI Now And here I have the top of the remote control UI Uh heres some kind of chip UI Uh on top of this there are uh the numbers UI Uh you have all on your remote control UI And uh the teletext uh button UI And uh heres the battery UI And when you push the button it will uh will be sent to the chip UI And the chip will um send it to all kind of subcomponents UI Thats what I said its very difficult UI And after that it will be sent to the infrared UI And that will send it to your television UI Thats a short h uh how it works UI Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult but we all we all dont get it UI My preferences UI Its uh it wont be uh We shouldnt make it too big UI Uh also for the cost uh we should only put one battery on it UI A longlasting battery UI Uh also for the cost uh use only plastic UI Not other materials UI Also because of the cost uh not too much buttons on it UI We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button UI And then um that that you will see it on the TV UI And on the TV you can uh switch into the menu UI Thats I think its easier PM Mmhmm UI And the bleep signal y uh you told us UI Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something when the batterys empty then there is a bleep UI Then youll have to change it in a in a week or something UI And also the bleep when what I told you about uh when you lost it and you push a button and then you hear bleep bleep and we will find it UI This is uh just uh Yeah ID Oh oh ID Two questions UI Yeah ID The battery ID You say one battery is cheaper ID Why UI If we w if we use only just one uh small penlight then it will be cheaper than when we use two ID Yeah but when you use two you can use it two times longer UI Yeah but then well have to make the um remote control uh long lasting ID Okay so its the size of the remote control UI Just Yeah ID Okay and the buttons ID When you use it on the television youve you need the television wh which can use it UI Yeah UI But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ID S Okay UI Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ID I think we have to use it also on other televisions though UI Then this is an option ID So Yeah but I dont I think it They are two different things though UI Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions UI And then we make it easier uh for our televisions UI And on the other tele televisions you can also use it but then we wont use the Yeah ID We have to choose one ID It has to work on o uh all televisions PM Mm UI Okay UI Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions UI And we will uh look forward and dont make a remote control which for the older televisions ME Hmm ID Okay UI And I just uh have one more idea UI Uh maybe its one of your tasks UI But Uh to have a trendy remote control we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones UI To change covers UI So if you have uh a trendy half with all red uh yellow and something UI And then you can put a red cover on it ME Hmm UI And also different things ID Yeah ID Good idea ME Will this will this add to the cost UI Yes UI Uh then it wont be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one UI And then you can buy the covers ME Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it ME D does it make it more difficult to design UI I think it will be a little more difficult but not too much ID Mmhmm ME Not much ME Kay UI Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones ID Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones UI Just one UI Yeah but then well have to to just um put five covers on it and see if it works UI If it wont works then well get something else UI Then we uh wont g uh go further with it ID Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost UI Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China it it wont be I guess so expensive I think ID Yeah but there are also design cost ID I dont think When you have a remote control do you change the cover UI Maybe ID Would you change the cover UI I wi I wont UI But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it and uh the the children think oh this is my remote control uh I made a picture on it ID No ID N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit UI Uh Yeah ID So Yes it is but I dont think we have to do it UI Okay UI And the other people ME Um Mm UI What do you think about it PM Yeah its a good idea PM But If if it Yeah I dont Im not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But its uh yeah its uh original idea UI Okay PM No UI Okay UI Youre the Project Manager ID Okay UI Yes UI Thats it ID Thats clear ID Okay thank you ID So now the User Interface Designer PM Oh PM Thats me PM Uh Come on PM Ah ME Yeah PM Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design PM Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the TV set PM Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way PM No cords attached PM And uh well it all by pushing a button on the remote PM That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting PM Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web PM Uh well the same idea here PM Uh message to the television PM And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off and uh switching channels and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that PM Uh well these are two uh remotes and thats our uh our dilemma I think PM Uh We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is PM But uh shall we make a basic remote control uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more PM Or uh uh more functions on the remote PM Uh maybe more devices you can influence PM Uh a radio or a v a video recorder uh VCR PM Yeah well thats our dilemma PM Um any ideas about that PM Basic or multifunctional ID Well got back on that later PM Okay yeah PM Yeah well the that was just on my mind ME Yes PM So uh I didnt know what uh what way we would go PM Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk UI Kay ID Kay thank you ID Then its your turn the marketing expert ME Okay ME Uh um m Yeah ME Um yeah okay ME This bit too far ME So So Im uh gonna have a presentation about um the market about um yeah what people think ME Uh we did a usability labtest with a hundred persons ME And we looked at uh several um things ME Uh among them design uh d d how d did they like the use of it uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls ME Uh well what what will be our market ME And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features ME If um that would be a good idea or not ME Well our findings ME Uh our users they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls ME Um uh they especially found found them very ugly ME And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it ME Uh well they also zap a lot ME So uh zapping uh should be very easy ME And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons ME So a lot of unused buttons ME There is more findings ME Uh on the buttons ME Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ME And how much would they use them ME Well uh the most used button is the channel selection ME And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are ME The power volume and channel selections are very relevant ME Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important ME Uh not important they found the audio uh thats not the volume but uh specific the the pitch or the left or right ME Uh the screen and the brightness ME And uh channel settings ME Uh th and they also are not used very often ME Then we have a few um graphs about the market ME Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups ME Um as you can see most users are uh between thirty six and forty five ME Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big ME And to come back on the the swapping uh things uh I dont think uh I I think the younger will be most interest in it ME But uh they are not a very big group ME Um in the we asked them uh how would you like a s a new feature ME If you have an LCD on the remote control what would you think of it ME Now you can clearly see young users say ME I will that would very nice ME And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think ME And they wont like it ME And another thing how would you like to have a speech recognition on it ME Well here we see the same ME Young users uh think thats an interesting idea ME And old users not ME Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim ME Uh the first are the younger the age between sixteen and forty five ME Uh they are highly interested in the features as you can see uh here ME And um they are more critical on their money spending ME Uh the second group is the older group ME Aged between forty six and sixty five ME They are less interested in uh new features ME But uh they spend their money more easily ME Now if we look back at this graph we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent ME And the second group about forty percent ME So the the first group is bigger ME Well then I come to my uh personal preferences ME Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at ME Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesnt say that old people wont buy it ME But less of them will buy it ME Um well I uh Okay ME What I thought um even young people say its hard to use remote control ME So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use thats especially aimed at this group even uh the young group will also be more interested ME And um we can make special features ME But uh I think it looks nice in the first time ME But when use it uh I dont know whats uh good thing of speech recognition PM Mmhmm ME Um well th uh thats my second point ME Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control ME Its about discussion we had earlier ME Um You can find most functions on a TV set ME So uh you dont have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness ME And such things ME Um well the design is very important ME One thing I did not say I think is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one ME But they found most remote controls very ugly ME So the design of our remote control is very important ME And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly as most users use it for that ME That were my findings ID Okay thank you UI Yeah UI I have uh one question UI If we aim for the younger people um and there will be uh a lot of features like LCD or the the the speech uh f recognising uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher ID Yes ME Yes PM Mmhmm UI Uh I think we dont have that in our budget PM No UI Do you think ME No PM And I dont uh I dont think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something UI Like No UI No PM So its Yeah its hard to uh get the younger group UI Uhhuh ID I think uh the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition ID So I think that can be an d good option PM Mmhmm ID LCD PM Just the LCD ID Yes ID Only the LCD PM Mmhmm ID So But well come back on that ME Okay ID Now Oh go on ID What d d d um Um Uh we go back on the decisions later ID Now we have a few new product requirements ID First teletext ID We have internet now so we dont need the teletext anymore ID So not necessary ID Next ID Only for the television ID So we dont look at the other things like the radio or something ID Only the television ID Third ID We look at the age group of forty plus ID Uh no younger than forty ID Is a g big group and like you showed n not very much people buy our stuff ID Fourth point ID Our corporate colour and slogan must be used ID Very important for the design ID So you can see it on our site ID Next ID Um no ID We have to make our decisions what we want to do ID So like you said we need the ID Maybe its good to put it in a document ID Now we have to decide what controls do we need ID So maybe you can tell us ME Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said ID Sorry ME The the requirements you just said maybe we should first have a discussion about that ID Yes ID Yes its okay ME I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option ME Uh not everyone um who is looking TV can go to internet when they want to see the latest news ID Yeah but we dont use it ID Its a new requirement ID So its not my requirement UI Kay well just have to do that ID We have to do this UI Okay ME Okay UI No discussion about it ME Okay sorry ME Then uh Mine ID No UI Okay UI Unfortunately ID So what controls do we need ID Who first PM Well a power button ID Okay ID Uh power PM Uh the well um I think separate channels PM So But then both the the separate channels ID Uh mm channel PM So so uh zero to nine or something ID Channel Zero to nine PM Uh volume ID Volume ID Maybe its easy to pick ID What was w your one ID Techno Okay ME Its the functional requirements ID We had w uh no no no no ID Where was that example of the Johan PM Oh mine ID That was the the the the the technical Hallo PM Technical ID Okay ID What do we need ID Onoff ID Zero to nine UI To change to the next channel just one button UI To move up move down ID Yeah thats the channel ME D Yeah ME Do we make a menu ID Menu ID Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus ID Uh M Menu ME Uh I think it will be um q quite easy to use to have uh uh four arrows ID I think um the only one or two numbers PM Mm yes ID And Hello ID Thats ch Yes ME Updown for channel selection and leftright uh for volume ME And uh a menu uh button ME And if you press the menu button you get into the menu and you can use the same buttons ME But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options ID On the LCD screen you mean ME Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the TV ME Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control ID Think its better to have it on the remote control cause it it has to work on all televisions ID So we need N Yes ME Yes UI But then we come to the costs ID But if we have this So now we dont have a lot of buttons ME Kay ME But well if you aim at the younger market um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control ME And also to find the easy to use uh part very important ME So if we have a LCD sh uh screen and uh not too many buttons I think that will incre uh uh even when its a bit more cost it will still sell ID Is this enough PM Mute ID Mute ID Maybe in the menu PM Um Yeah but then its always uh more than one uh thing to do ME Mm ID Mute ID Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Okay ID Maybe more ID No ID Well ID Then thats all ID This will be the buttons ID And I think thats enough for the next phase ID So we can go on to Yes UI But now we have only the buttons UI And uh we dont yet have to decide what the remote control would look like UI Or Okay ID No thats for the next phase ID Um Phase two is the conceptual design ID So then well have the concepts UI Okay UI Okay ID Thats for the So uh next point ID Now we have lunchbreak ID After that we have t thirty minutes for work ID And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons ID No ID Your individual action you can find them in the email ID So now its time for lunch UI Okay ME Okay ME Good idea ID Thanks for coming,"The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material. He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this. The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional. The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study. The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them. The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed. The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute."
ID Okay ID Well lets start ID What are we doing ID Oops PM Hmm UI Ah pinball ID Okay ID Okay ID Not doing ME Mm ID Uh Very good ME Ah PM Oh ME Hey ME Ah ME Now I have my screen back too ID Okay ME Yeah ID we have presentations ID So first its your turn PM Mine PM Oh great ID Yeah UI Huh ID Isnt it amazing ME Yeah ME Very interesting PM Uh Yes well uh lets uh talk about the interface uh concept ID Industrial Designer ID Interface concept PM Uh first Ill uh Ill uh discuss the buttons we just chose uh show you some samples uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe already PM And uh my personal preferences PM Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off PM The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off PM The channels buttons one to nine and uh off uh uh zero to nine and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine PM Uh the volume and channel quadrants uh left and right up and down arrows to uh do the volume and channel PM And the menu menu button to man manipulate the LCD uh display PM Um I found some uh interesting uh uh samples PM Examples PM Um well uh whats pretty standard is uh that its that theyre all pretty uh uh high uh Yeah ME Large ME A lot a lot of buttons buttons PM Yeah PM Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long PM Um power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right PM Um well we see the the the same uh arrows PM Like there PM And uh Yeah well arrow b buttons can be blue PM And whats interesting is the the the icons on the buttons PM Some buttons have icons like the play and stop but we dont use that PM But uh these we we have to choose the right icons or or letters PM Uh this is the V for volume but theyre both uh a V PM So its its not really very uh clear whats the function of that ME Yeah PM Um Yeah PM So thats Uh well Yeah ID Can you go back one page ID For the uh menu what do we use for that ID We dont have buttons for the menu ID Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel PM I thought that was our uh idea ID Okay PM So uh how Like this ID But uh You have to put it on the Yeah PM Or or this PM And that the menu button is okay ID Yeah but has to be clear that you can use the arrows PM Yeah okay ME Yes PM Uh so the The icons on the arrows as well you mean ID Mmhmm ID Yes ID The second one PM Yeah PM Uh well thats something to uh think about ID Okay UI Uh maybe Ill have something in my uh presentation UI And you will see it PM Okay ME Okay PM Um well I dont I dont know if we have to discuss this already or in the next uh meeting PM But uh as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo I would uh recommend a yellow case PM Uh round edges PM The logo at the bottom PM And uh well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour PM So its good PM Uh recognisable PM K so I think ID Not too much colours PM Uh no PM Not too much PM But uh No no no ID No its not flower power PM But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and Uh yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion ID S okay ID Okay PM That was that ID Thank you ID So youre next UI Im next okay UI Yes UI No UI Here we go UI Uh at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to ME Okay ME Mmhmm UI And then Ill discuss what my opinion is about the costs about uh what battery is in it what kind of buttons also UI First uh the younger people they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours UI Like totally yellow totally red UI Uh so its visible UI Uh the shapes are curved and round like uh you also said UI Maybe its nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones straight and uh flat and long UI But to give him the shape of your hand so you its easier to use or something like that UI But thats just an idea UI And then Ill have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control UI The battery there are few options UI Uh I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery UI So everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket UI Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch UI When you uh shake it a few times it its loaded UI Uh the the form of the remote control I think its also nice have it curved UI And maybe like its handshaped UI Uh so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons UI Uh material you use plastic UI Hard plastic uh because uh it wont have to burst uh like in the in one time UI And also rubber because the younger people like that what we see in the research UI Uh the pushbuttons UI We have one new thing uh discovered UI Its a scroll push uh thing like a mouse UI Maybe its uh easy to use uh for the channels UI When you want to go m move up you just scroll up and click on the button if you wanna see the next uh if you wanna see that channel UI And also for the mouse uh for the volume its also uh easy to use UI Just scroll a bit up scroll a bit down UI And thats also easy just w when you have a thing like this and you get it here UI You can do it with your thumb UI And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one you can see channel one ME Hmm UI The electrics um with a scroll push uh button we must use regular uh chips UI There are also uh simple chips UI They are uh cheaper UI Um but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control and I think there are a lot of those uh things and people wont buy it any more UI They have seen enough of it UI And you have also advanced um chips UI But thats with the LCD uh screen UI And the costs will increase a lot more UI And I think our budget is too low to use and an LCD and the chip who is more expensive UI And maybe its also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control that we then use the primary colours UI Like you get a yellow uh remote control red one blue one et cetera UI You have any more questions about this UI I think the main thing is we look at the costs ME Yep ID Hmm UI And not too basic not a basic remote control who everybody already has ME Yeah ME But thi i uh This is with an LCD ME No not UI Not with an LCD ID No isnt UI No ID But the LCD is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons ID Then you can scroll you see what number and then you push UI Yeah UI But then what I say the costs will uh get a lot higher ID But then its not easy to use scroll uh wheel UI Th then youll see it on the television ID If you dont Hmm yes ID But then ID Yeah then you go one down one up ID When you scroll UI Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television its like you see uh one to twenty you go uh uh s scroll up and push number tw twenty ID Yeah but like we said before it has to be used on every television ID So you may not be uh No ID The television must do that UI Mmhmm ID So Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room UI Yeah I think the younger people will have newer televisions which can provide our uh remote control ID And mostly they are smaller UI Yes ID So Most the times that are not advanced televisions UI But that wont be a problem UI I think UI No but then well get to the regular uh remote controls UI And I think what I said everybody has them uh has them already UI And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros UI Uh and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing UI And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news ID Okay ME Uh can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with LCD or without UI I got it on my screen and it was uh higher UI But I dont know uh how much higher ME Cause it I think if we have an LCD it will also sell a lot better ID Thats important UI Thats true ME And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh UI But then well I think we must discuss who uh what will be better UI If we have a better shape of the um remote control or better options on it UI With a scroll menu a w scroll thing and a LCD UI And then a flat um remote control UI Or a more handshaped remote control with scroll without LCD ID Yeah ID Maybe you can look how how much it is for the LCD UI I can uh look on my uh Uh Note that the pushbutton requires a simple chip chip ID Its very important UI A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip which is a higher price range UI The display requires a advanced chip which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip ID Yeah more expensive ID But how much UI Doesnt say ID Oh PM Hmm ID Okay UI Thats from my manufacturing division ID Okay ME Kay ID Well thank you ME My turn UI Yes ID Next ME Mm ME So So Yeah ME So my uh presentation is about trendwatching ME Uh I did some trendwatching ME Its very important to uh keep up with latest trends ME Cause if you dont you wont sell ME So well how we did do that ME Uh well we made an investigation of the market by Trendwatchers ME They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan ME Of course well known for their uh trend uh trends ME And well uh what did you find ME Uh we have two groups young and trendy and the old and rich ME Well th and the young and trendy they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes shoes and also uh products ME And um material ME That should feel have uh a spongy feeling ME And to get a feeling for what it is uh here is an image of it ME Then the old and rich ME They like uh dark colours and simple recognisable shapes ME And um they also like uh familiar material uh especially wood ME Now another picture ME To get a feeling for this ME Well uh then already come to my personal preferences ME We uh aim at the younger market ME So we should also be uh look at their uh trends ME However with trends its always if theres its now ME It it it might last one year and next year it be uh can be totally different ME And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year ME So we m must not just only look at what the trend is now as it might be totally different next year ME So thats uh one thing to keep in mind UI Changing covers ME Yeah ME Any questions UI Nope PM No ID No ID Its clear ID So now its uh Ah lets see ID Now w we have to decide Well we have to decide on the concept ID So we have to look at S next ID Components and user interface concept ID So Now we have to make some concept ID Maybe one of you can paint it on the board ID First uh user interface UI Uh uhuh UI How w how we how we make it UI Uh Shouldnt we first discuss about like what w we all Yeah but if I paint with More like something M like Yeah I cant dr I cant draw it ID Yes a concept on uh Just Yeah but maybe we can paint it ME Yeah ID Uh what do we want ID Ill paint ID Okay ID Well Something like this ME Mm ID Or Shapes or What do we need PM Mm yes ME Can make several uh concepts PM What ID Yes okay ME We have this and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand ID Okay ME Yeah I I I uh yes UI Uh I have to ID And you have to ID Yeah UI Im not a designer UI Its more three D UI Like um when you have a part here UI This is the remote control UI And then you have something like th this under it UI So its easier to get it like this PM Mm PM Yeah ME Yeah UI Its like a gun ME A g Mm ID So it has to be soft UI And it has to be soft yeah ID Okay UI So you can squeeze in it and Sorry ID And uh the buttons ID Buttons UI Buttons on top of it UI And here UI The scrolling UI You can do it with your thumb PM But but i thats the only scroll uh button on it then UI But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here ID No it wont UI One till uh uh zero till nine ID But well there one for the sound and one for the channels PM Yeah okay PM But but how Yeah ME Yeah UI And the b Yeah PM How Okay UI Or two buttons ME And i if we go to uh But if we have uh a me Yeah ID Uh two scroll uh wheels UI If uh Kay c If we do If we use one then well have just a switch on it and youll just switch it and now its the sound to switch back with the menu uh button PM Mm ID Thats th thats more difficult ID Its better in But if we dont have a LCD we dont have a menu ME If we have a menu uh how do we uh choose other options UI And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it UI Just not like all the other ones with uh this thing and uh here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow ME Yeah UI Because uh from h hundred uh remote controls ninety nine have it PM Yeah UI Uh then we have it on the TV the menu ME Uhuh ID Yeah but again maybe th How do we know the TV can handle it ID You dont know ID So theres no menu UI I dont know UI Its like some sort of uh teletext option but we dont have teletext ID No ID So you cant use it UI And if we put an LCD thing on it then the costs will uh be much higher ID Okay we make two concepts ID One with LCD ID One without LCD UI Kay UI But you all like this kind of thing UI Uh With the scroll button ID Good concept ID But Thats one UI And and this one has to be soft ME Uhuh UI And this has to be harder because when it falls it mu mu must not burst UI Or some kind of rubber around it PM Mmhmm ID Its one ID Two ID Number two PM And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger PM Like uh Just to uh Oh like a Yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah UI Ah thats nice UI Here UI Trigger ID No ID But when you handle it you put it on and off ID Its not good to use ID Yeah but Ill zap ID Fuck ID Out ID No its not good ME Yeah ID Now second concept ID One with LCD one without LCD ID Then uh Paint it UI Paint it UI With the scroll thing on like this ID One with two scroll buttons and one with without ID Yeah ID Uh one with a with a menu and one without a menu UI So ID And the one with with a menu has an LCD UI Draw it ID Unbelievable ID Do I have to do everything ID Blank ID You have Not so difficult PM But if you put push the the menu button Yeah wh what Yes but you dont know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose ME Yeah ID Uh thats the menu ID There for the LCD screen ID You have to For the menu PM Yeah ID Mmhmm ID One that way ID And one that way ID So Then it depends on the cost ID S On and off UI But is it easy to use UI When you have it on your left side and Separate more separate h yeah ID When its not too big ID Just like a a phone PM Mmhmm ME M uh yeah maybe its better if the uh scrollwheels are um more separate yeah ID Yes okay ME Like you have the menu button in between uh Yeah UI Yeah UI On the left a scroll button and on the right a scroll button UI But would it be easy to use then UI If its like you have a big uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for ID Very good ID Is it better ID When you uh the menu you have to go there there there there UI They were like round curves uh different uh Okay okay okay ID Yeah okay ID Thats thats the outside ID But now the First the buttons UI Mmhmm ME Think we have we have now two buttons missing ME The uh um The mute button ID Sorry ME We have two buttons missing ME The mute button ME And um the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay ID Mute ID And the other ID Yeah ID Not so difficult ME But uh Okay UI Personally I think two scroll buttons uh arent easy to handle ID But how do you wanna solve it UI With the switch button ID Yeah but on the menu thats not uh easy ID Then you go down you switch you go into the right you switch you go down UI No like uh Oh you mean like that ID Yeah UI Uh then you can also have like uh th um Yeah and joystick I think ID A joystick ID Yeah ID But is it uh Does that break a joystick ID Or a small one just like in a laptop UI Yeah like in a laptop s uh s some sort of thing UI A little bit bigger with easier thi I dont know ID Mean its better ID But how expensive it is ID Oh ID Why do I pay you for ID Um well um Better ideas UI Or no scroll uh things UI Just a shape UI And No no ID For the young peoples I think scroll buttons good UI It wont work UI Yeah UI Uhhuh ID So Think we have to keep them UI Or a remote control more like joystick ID Yeah but is it Thats not expensive than uh Joystick is better ID A small one UI A small one like this like a Nintendo uh k Playstation thing ID No just like in a a laptop ID Small round ID Then its not so big UI No no no UI I mean the the shape of the remote control ID Oh the sh Yeah but then you can You have to use t with one hand UI Just like a Playstation thing UI Yeah ID So Maybe if its possible its not too expensive I think a joystick is better ID A small one ID So please look at it UI No thats okay I got Uh theyre not uh in details ME And on the LCD how much it costs ME Uh it costs extra UI Its more expensive or less expensive huh ID Yeah we I think you get it ID So after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it UI Then I have to come with it ID Yes UI I got my personal costs UI I I dont I dont know the costs ID Your problem ID Not mine UI Then Ill uh make something up ID Okay ID So do we have other concepts ID Then for the components we use a normal battery PM Mm yeah ID Then its Ch cheapest way I think UI Yeah or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery ID No no kinetic UI Yeah I think its uh yeah more expensive ID Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive UI Yeah ID So we use a normal battery ME Yeah PM Yeah UI Okay ME Yes ID Chip ID Depends on the LCD UI Depends on the scroll ID Scroll UI If we use a scroll then we have the uh regular chip UI If we dont use a scroll then we can use the simple chip UI And thats Uh the most expensive ID Yeah ID And uh we If you use the LCD we have to Yes okay UI Yeah ID So depends on the LCD and the scroll UI If we Yeah ID Okay UI If we No okay scrollwheel UI So I have this UI So it will be uh the advanced chip or the uh regu uh or the regular chip ID Okay ID So uh the shapes of the design depends on the LCD and But it has to be small ID I think UI Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing UI And then just put also on LCD on it ID If you have pistol it LCDs not easy ID Y y Yeah but If you use a phone UI Just use your thumb UI If you Yeah UI I use my thumb ID k Yeah but but then you have it ID Like th if you have pistol you have it so UI Yeah ID And the screen is Well then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen UI If you have a joystick on No if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller ID Yeah UI And you move up f forward down left UI Then you have uh just yeah a little bit curved UI Its not just uh straight ID No ID No no UI Thats how we use it ME Uh Uh yeah but Yeah UI Thats why they make joysticks like that I think ID Yeah but then you look forward ID And then you can y N well if you have to look at it UI Yeah ME If you If we have uh then something standing here with the LCD UI Kay UI Heres our designer UI Yeah ID Then it goes like this UI Yeah why not ID If th n well Yes of course UI Its for the younger people UI Its something new PM Its uh Or you can uh turn it inside ID Thats good good ID But the um it may not break UI Now we put uh rubber around it ID Okay ID If thats possible ME Um Yeah UI Hard plastic uh the shape and around it hard uh around it rubber UI And the uh the hand shape is also rubber ID Okay ME I cant see the ME But uh the easy of uh th the ease of use wasnt uh the most important uh aspect of it PM But thats No thats true UI Huh ME Uh for us its about to sell it ME Uh One ID Yeah of course UI This is something new ID Okay ID Then this is the design ID And the buttons are on the next page ID So depends on the cost ID So um we have one minute UI Costs are okay ID I think ME No ID No ME You have more ID More ID Seven ME You have still ten ID Next meeting ID Thirty minutes ID So hurry up UI Oh thats us together ID You two stay here ID Paint it PM Okay ID Now you have to ID So I think its clear ID Check your mail ID So It has to be ready in the next meeting ME Yeah UI Yes ID So Next meeting is called the detailed design ME What PM Cookie ME Okay ID So Everyth everything has to be ready ME Okay ID Thanks for your attention UI Kay ME See you at the next meeting UI Bye bye,"The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls. He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons. The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber. He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used. The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision. The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products. The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board. They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs."
ID Okay ID So now um last time ID Can you uh push the button ID One time please ID So Im still the secretary ID Now uh I ask you to presentate the prototype ID One of your you two UI I dont care PM Oh this you mean UI Huh ID Yes ID The prototype PM Yes well uh this is it ME This is it ID Well thank you ID Uh now Yes PM Its uh its uh its yellow PM And uh this is rubber PM And and and this too PM The the sides PM And the rest is hard plastic PM And uh We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside PM And then it covers the these buttons until here or something ID Okay ME Yes PM And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick ID Mmhmm PM So you can still operate uh all the things PM Because you dont always use the menu PM And then it can break ID Okay ID And the buttons PM Uh well uh Big buttons UI Big PM And everything is blue except the power button PM And the mute PM Of uh yeah and the mute and the the other button PM Yeah PM Channel higher channel button ME Yeah ID And the joystick is for the volume and the channels PM Uh yes UI Yes PM Yes thats uh Very obvious UI Up is channel up UI Down is channel down UI To the right is volume up UI To the left is volume down PM Yeah ID Okay so if joystick and LCD ID Whats the RR d Okay UI The RR PM RRs the l the the the the company uh logo ID Very good ID So we have So what they say on the side is put fashion there ME Thats on the rub rubber part PM Uh yes PM Yes PM Thats about here ID Yes ID Its good PM Oh ID So thats it ME Yeah ID Thats prototype ID Now the finance ID We dont know if its th it if its okay ME Alright ID So Im gonna look ME Do we Do we change the Do we change the the order ID We have Sorry ME Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ID Finance is um Yeah its No first uh Yes ID We have to evaluate the product yet ME Okay ID Sorry ME Thats uh um That can be none ME Um we gonna do the evaluation now together ME But I have uh a introduction how it works ME So it will come up ME Uhoh ME Okay ME Um yeah ME Well we uh uh I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias uh based on um our marketing strategy on uh the latest trends on user preferences ME Uh we have a seven point scale from uh true as well ME To false seven ME And on base of each c uh criteria we need to um give a rating ME We can uh Well it look like this ME But we gonna uh do it here they said ME So you hope found out how to do it with a Word document ME Yeah ME Okay yeah ME Yeah ME Um well uh we have the Word document You So we open up that blank here ID Criteria ME Um Think I can Uh what this just an example ME So this not very important ME But um if I can get a number in here ME Hmm ID No its okay ME Well uh we cant do that UI Ill get it ID Oh its okay ME Um so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative ME Uh and then we have to uh agree on the rating together ME And in the end we will c uh count an average of all rating ME The first uh on each item ID What do you think ME Yeah I think its uh Uh well technologically using its not uh it doesnt contain many new features ME Only the LCD ME So it Um I think I will give it a yeah yeah yeah a four ME Hmm UI I think the scrollbutton is something also uh new UI What uh not anoth uh not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have UI I think technologically Ill give it an seven UI Si six six UI Sorry six ME So now i I think you uh see it um its statement ID Yeah ME And you true or false UI Oh true or false UI Oh uh Ill Ill give it uh a t a two ME And true is one ME So yeah ME Yeah ID Two UI Sorry ID You PM Three ID Me too ID So its a three ME Kay ME Um well Its a one ME The first item ME So okay the second item ME Um this product is for all sorts of customers PM Mm Mm four ME Well its a statement which uh I disagree with because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow its not uh really aimed for all customers ME It doesnt look like that ID So its a Yes its for the younger g group ME Thats uh a six UI Five PM Yeah but its its Yeah ID So its uh half half of the people ID So I think its four PM I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons PM So I mean the colours are for young people but older Yeah UI Mmhmm ID No ID Yes ID So I think its four UI Maybe version uh three point O uh has other colours PM Yeah PM Maybe ID Okay ID Give it a four UI Four ME Four ID Yep ME Uh okay ME Mm ID We put the fashion in electronics ME Thats uh the motto of our company ME Yeah well do we do this with uh this product ME I um Yeah ME I think if we do this as its uh uh c uh its really orientates on the design ME Um so I would give it a two UI Me too a two because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard UI But the rest of it is UI So I think a two PM Yes PM Two ME Two ID Uh I say uh a five ID Its not fashion its new ID It must be a fashion ID But it isnt UI It it will be fashion ID Yes ID It w If its not a fashion we can put it in it ID So it must be a fashion ID I think its a five ME Uh Okay PM Then make it th three ME Okay ME Yes Ill think of that too ID No UI Kay ID Oh UI Three is okay ME Yeah agree ID I use my feet though UI Oh well wait outside ME A three ID Okay ME Yeah okay ME The next element um is the product looks good ME Well personally I do not prefer a um remote control thats fully in yellow ME So I would give this a five UI I give it a one PM Yes a one PM I like it ID Well I say three ID So counting then is two and a half ME We have to do our uh Two or three UI Say two ID Okay two UI Two ME Two ME Okay ME So well we gonna do the next part ME Uh yep ME Uh uh the next statement ME It has not too much buttons ME Um yeah I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better ME And in the end we calculate an average ME So um thats why its a negative in it ME Um well this one of our aims not have too much buttons ME So um uh did we uh do that ME Well uh if we go to uh this fashion I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers ME But you can you can go for that ME And um that way you dont have a lot of buttons over ME So I would give this a two UI One ID You PM One ID Me too ID One ME One ME Um but where where is the ID Next six ID It does not get lost easily ME So Yeah did we implement uh the sound UI Uh Just a small thing PM Yes ID No we did not PM Yeah but uh Yeah ID So but can it get lost if its such a thing UI Ah ID I dont think so UI Yellow UI Looks like a pistol ID Yes ID Not a not a normal shapes UI Uh It wont get between uh the pillows uh on the couch ID So No ID It wont get lost ME Yeah ID So A one UI Uh Yeah o one ME It wont PM Yeah ID Okay a one ME One ID Next ME Okay um well we aimed for the younger market ME Uh yeah did we achieve that ME I think with the way it looks and um it is designed I will give it a two ID Yeah me That was our target UI Yeah UI Me too ID Two UI Two ME Yeah UI Yeah ID Yep UI Yeah ID Right ID Theres a fancy lookandfeel ME Uh yes ME That that was uh yeah one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said ME I didnt uh say it in my presentation ME But um well does it have that ME I would say yes ME So um Well lets also give this a two ME T Yeah UI I gave this a one because of the rubber UI It feels soft UI Uh it looks like a l uh uh b uh a bit like a joystick UI Its Yeah UI Yeah f very fancy trendy ID Okay PM Yes a one ID I say a two ID Its a a bit personal ID If its fancy ID So I think s two is better PM Yeah okay ME Okay UI Two is okay ME Two ME And um then the last one I could think of uh it goes with the latest trends ID No its new ID Innovation ME If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people and they ate uh fruit and vegetables well it has a um a nice colour uh well compared to food but we didnt uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that UI Oh ME So I would did not give this uh a one or two ME I Well go for a three UI I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round UI Uh the latest trends are soft things you know like uh I said in my presentation ME Yes UI Uh But the the colours are um basic like yellow red um blue UI Something what also younger people want UI Its also a trend so Ill give it a two ID Okay PM Mm three ID Me too ID Three ME A three ID Yeah ME Okay ME So um come back to the presentation now ME So we find yourself there and now we have to calculate an average rating ME So we will do that ID Effort is three ten and twelve ME Yes ID Thirty forty fifty ID Twenty one ID So its uh two and three nine two and one third ME By nine UI Two ME Yeah ME Um uh okay ME Two ID Yep ME Come on ID Uh nah ID Okay ME So uh thats a pretty low rating I think PM Yes ID So its good ME So according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job ID Okay ID Thank you UI Yeah I think ME Oh ME Nah ME How am I doing ME Yes ME And I closed your slideshow ID Okay ID Back to my uh Yep ME Which one was the last for you ME Uh dreaming ID Next please ME Next ID So now uh we have a product ME Finance ID Very happy ID But uh is

really a s Yeah its this one UI Joystick uh thing ID Now uh button supplement ID Special colour ID We already Uh thats the from the for the buttons ID The buttons are regular colour PM Mm yeah ID So then uh then then then then then then Then Uh no UI Were not gonna make it ID Its too expensive UI Yeah UI Wh What what are the costs ID So we have to change something ID Fifteen Euros UI Fifteen ID Yeah well uh when we lose one scrollwheel its okay ID Cause we cant lose the battery ID We cant lose the advanced chip ID We cant lose the double curve ID We have rubber special colour ME We would have uh n For a remote control UI A special colour UI Uh I dont think its a very special colour ID Oh no we No its uh Sorry UI Yellow UI Uh is it a special colour ME Ive For a remote control I think it is UI What UI Yeah ME If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick ME For up down left right ID Um then we uh lose two Euros ID Then we have thirteen Euros ID Half a Euro too much ID Exactly the special colours UI And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber ID So Thats one Euro UI One Euro discount ID So I dont think thats good ID Mm I think we have to keep the LCD ID If Yes UI If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up button down button right button left ID Then its only thirteen Euros UI And then well lose fifty cent in what ID So uh yeah ID Yeah ID Then you have Or you have to cut this off UI Uh uhuh ID Then its not good anymore UI No ID So wait ID Okay ID Ill have a look ID We Yellow rubber UI And if you say its just a r uh normal colour its a normal colour wh No one will see it ID Yeah normal UI Normal colour and the the joystick away and put the button up button down right left ID Uh One minute please UI And its twelve Euros I think ID Uh Is it maximum ID Um Yeah its normal colour ID But if you lose the joystick its still uh an advanced chip UI No UI Uh no no no ID Or its then a regular UI Uh Oh wait wait wait ME The advanced chip was for the LCD wasnt it PM Yeah UI Oh yeah ID So the advanced is for the LCD and the regular for the joystick UI Oh yeah UI Yeah UI Yeah yeah ID And what if we lose the LCD UI If we lose the LCD then we have an uh regular chip and no LCD ID Yeah regular chip ID But Is it a good design UI Uh yeah UI Then youll have to m uh see the menu on the television UI And you dont have the LCD ME If uh If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons we would have uh we have thirteen Euros UI So the TVs has to uh have to be uptodate UI Yeah ID Mm yes ME And then uh we move the the colour ME What will that be UI Yeah ID Then its okay UI Huh UI No knew that ME Yeah ID Okay so no joystick ID Oh no but we then we get pushbuttons from half a Euro UI Yeah then its twelve Euro fifty then its okay ID Uh yes yes yes yes ID No joystick ID Pushbuttons ID No special colour ID Twelve and a half Euros ID Then its okay ID So we have to change that

have to be the same colour ID Yes UI But then the print on it will g um change it UI Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is UI Uh l How you call it PM Recognisable UI Recognisable yeah PM Like what Yeah ID Yes PM Mm yeah ID So So Well Now we have to change that but thats okay UI Yeah PM Okay UI Okay ID Rubber ID Whats the normal colour UI Oh well thats clear ID So And Wheres ID Yeah ID So now its Yeah UI And the joystick away UI And its buttons ID It is ID But then it will be just that ones UI Yeah ID Now its Very good ME still he waited at the No ID Now uh project eva evaluation ID Well What do you think of it ID Uh About the project UI About the process ME Project UI Went good UI Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough UI We have a gun instead of a remote control UI Um Uh leadership UI Yeah you were the project project manager and uh had the final vote UI So yeah that was clear UI Teamwork okay UI Everybody uh has something uh to say about it UI And uh no uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult UI But nah UI New ideas found UI Nope ID Okay ID And you PM Yeah well the same PM I I espe I especially uh liked the the means the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it ID Okay PM Yeah ME Yeah I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices ME I think um Well the laptops if you have them out front of you you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation ME Um well uh the drawboard well you can draw things ME But it not really going very convenient PM Mmhmm ME Uh maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there ME And with a normal mouse ME Um and uh the project ME Yeah I agree on what was said uh mainly ME Uh yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others ME And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking ME To tell their opinion ID Okay ID Well what do I have to say ID I think it was good ID Not too many discussions UI No ID So its good for the speed PM No UI Yep ID So I think were ready ME Yeah ID Good price ID Evaluation ready ID Ready UI Beer ID Thats it UI Yeah ME Okay UI Okay then,"The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen. Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria. The overall rating was two. The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros. The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful."
PM Good morning Flores ID G good morning PM Marketing Expert ID Oh yeah PM Right ID Are you ready ID You should put the laptop uh right into the square PM For the cameras Alright ID For i for the cameras yes ID Good morning Sebastian UI Good morning Mister PM UI How are you today ID Im fine UI How was your business trip to Boston ID Um well actually I didnt go didnt feel like it PM Geez ID So Do you want to open it as readonly ID Um I guess I should close it here PM You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um sen oh standby PM Close the the window ME Okay ID Okay the waiting is for our Marketing Expert Ruud PM So Thats right PM Ruud ID Um project kickoff UI Is there a schedule for this meeting ID Yes there is actually ID Um I will li list the agenda for today ID For this meeting ID Good morning Ruud ME Good morning ID Uh its important um yeah great UI I shall close the door ID Its important that the laptops are um exactly on the square um for the cameras ID Okay ID Okay ID Um were here to develop uh a new product ID Um Im sure youve had a mail from our account manager about it PM Mmhmm ID Um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it ID Um you are here in a specific role ID Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer ID Is that correct UI Thats correct PM Mmhmm ID Okay ID Um were going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here ID Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan uh and we will have a discussion ID Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes so we should keep that in mind PM Alright UI Okay UI Um is there any room for a little presentation UI Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ID There is ID Yeah there is UI Okay ID No problem ID Um okay this new product we are are g are going to develop um its a remote control a television remote control ID Um and first of all it should be original it should be trendy and userfriendly ID Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals um and Im sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop ID Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things PM Okay ID The market we should have a look at the market ID Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development um which consists of three different design stages ID Uh the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work prepare and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions yes PM Progressions ID Um the first stage the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements and we will um make a specific uh specification of that ID Um the second is the technical functional design um what effect should the remote have ID Well in this case control t the the television I think PM Its for the vision PM Yeah ID Um and the last one is the working design ID How exactly does it work in the technical sense ID Um the other design stages uh we will discuss that later ID So well kop it keep it with the functional design ID Okay um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here ID Um as you see now I can give a presentation ID Um its also possible to use this one as well ID You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to ID Um to um presentate to show us uh a file youll need to uh place it in your project documents folder which is on your desktop at least it should be ID Um then we have this electronic whiteboard system ID Um yeah I will show that now ID Um you can draw on the board using this pen ID There are little um uh sensors so do not grab it here but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end PM Sensors ID Um well it its on the um eraser now so we click the pen button ID Okay so not too fast writing ID Um you can insert a new um slide or or whiteboard uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button ID Its quite the same ID Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file ID So do not m make a new file ID Just use this one uh during the day ID Um you can use the eraser to make something go away PM But we all use the same whiteboard file So we can work together on it while were or should we only use it in the in the meetings ID Yes ID Yeah ID Yeah in the meetings only in the meetings PM Yeah okay ID Its really like like a regu regular whiteboard PM Yeah alright PM Yep ID Um you can choose the format um sorry ID Uh Let me see ID Um Well I guess its maybe because Im not s uh pen selected ID Yep ID Current colour you can choose another colour ID And um for example black and you c I can choose the line width ID Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour ID Okay ID Quite easy if you uh do have any questions just c ask me ID Um to um oh well Im I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us ID Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected ME Okay ME Um green ME An animal ME Okay ME Um Uh a wee rabbit PM Its a bunny ID A rabbit UI Alright ID Okay well great ID Um Roo could you do the same please PM But of course Flores ID But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width PM Blank ID Sebastian is thinking about the animal UI Im just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal ID Okay PM Yeah Im think about it too PM Format PM Well it looked more than a bunny than a cat but it works right ID It it should be a cat ME Yeah ID Okay UI Well Ill give it a try UI Mm ID Im guessing a horse UI Very good PM With a very small legs UI I was very good in drawing PM You should feed that uh that animal UI Well I guess you uh get the idea ID Yes okay UI Beautiful ID Beautiful ID Okay so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to ID Um any questions well just just let me know ID Um okay back to our project ID Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros ID Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros which is quite a number ID Um we uh we will focus this internationally so the product will be sold um if there is market uh interest uh in in more than one country ID And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development um because uh well those are important numbers ID Um then the discussion maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation UI Yes um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion because uh there might be some uh influations influences ID Limitations ID Okay PM Okay UI Okay ID Okay great UI Okay UI Um first about my role role of the Industrial Designer UI I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities UI So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas uh Ill try to translate them in technical functions but uh there might be some impossibilities UI So thats one UI Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that but well these are quite the same UI Sorry about that UI Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product PM Okay UI I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion UI One thing about uh interopera operability UI Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment UI Uh for instance uh DVD players cell phones video and audio equipment UI So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment PM And for a cell phone UI Well there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them PM Yeah okay PM Yeah UI I think it could come in handy UI We should discuss that UI Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other UI Were not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore so infrared is not uh is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore UI But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth PM But Yeah but the infrared its uh well a little bit oldfashioned if you would call it like that UI Mmhmm UI But its costeffective PM But all the TVs are uh equipped with infrared so y you you can Most of them UI Yes UI Mmhmm UI Well not all not all UI So thats the point UI So Maybe but thats uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it PM Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote PM Yeah UI So thats just my role Ill just uh give you uh everybody some technical input and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look but take these things into account when you start the discussion ID Yeah ID Okay so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability and Okay and and uh Okay UI Yes so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment and the way of communicating with these equipments ID Okay good UI Okay ID Um that was your presentation UI Thats it ID Okay okay ID Um okay ID Great ID Um Ill go back to my own presentation ID Um Mm ID Okay ID Um I I do think its time now to to discuss uh mm some things ID Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications ID Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruuds uh role ID Um the way how it should be controlled by the user which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part PM Mmhmm ID Um so lets start with you ID H how do you think the remote should um function for the user PM Well I had a few uh things in mind PM Um well the interoperability just like uh Sebastian said um the remote should work on different TVs or even different uh um Yeah uh what is it devices ID Yep PM Um so i i I think its a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store UI Yes I think it should be something like that PM Its not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right ID Okay so were were going business to consumer not were were its not a No PM Yeah I do I dont know that PM Its no I have uh dont have the information for it UI Were not developing this product for a specific vendor are we UI No were just developing this product and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public so it should fit to every device ID No PM No okay PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Uh Ruud y do you agree ME Yeah I think I think theyre right yeah ID Okay ID Okay PM Um Well the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the TV PM Thats just the basic f technical function ID Yeah PM So that was my really my part for uh this session PM Um Well thats just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device ID So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um Okay UI Yeah UI Mmhmm PM It just should change the TVs state PM So thats it PM Um but furthermore Yeah UI And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this UI Or are there any o other controls PM Yeah with buttons UI Are there only any other cont Well I Ive seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward sidewords PM Yeah or maybe you want a touchscreen or But Yeah ID Uhhuh UI You know these things UI And um its very easy for a user to to switch w yes to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a CD on on a chapters you know on a DVD player PM Theyre very vu vulnerable PM Yeah UI So maybe thats an idea I dont know PM Yeah PM And for other user interface I had um well its more industrial thing PM Uh point at a TV I think its its quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the TV so you must point everywhere so maybe infrared is Yeah just dont even point it so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that UI Mmhmm UI Okay ID Maybe not even pointed ID Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Okay Uh Okay gentlemen um uh just a reminder we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay UI Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range the operating range too UI So when youre not able to point at the device um the range is very limited PM Yeah if you g if you go to radio or or yeah PM For TV youre always in in the neighbourhood of a TV so I dont think think the range should be a problem to that but if you want to uh get it working with a radio and youre in outside your garden with just one uh speaker then maybe the range should be uh But Yeah UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Okay PM Two more things PM Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand PM You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever I think ID Okay s yeah ID Yeah PM And of course you dont always know where all buttons are so it should be visible al um in dark too PM So when its dark Those are two really uh user interface Yeah ID Okay ID Uh Ill write down glow in the dark PM Thats perfect ID Is tha Okay UI Okay ID Okay um uh I just want to hear uh Ruuds um input for this meeting UI Do do you Um well yes I had uh about three minutes ago but Ive seem to forget them forgot them ID Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ID Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ME Uh I think most most things have already been said like uh control multiple devices ID Mmhmm ME And uh yeah infrared might be an issue ID Because ME Uh well he said about n abo what he said about pointing ID Mmhmm ME But uh lots of devices already use infrared ME So well probably have to implement that ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay Sebastian did you have any other ideas UI Um oh yes I remember UI Um you said something about visibility in the dark UI Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control on which you can see functions PM Yeah UI Which makes it easier to operate it PM Yeah PM Well maybe I um but it it can be quite simple you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it UI I I dont know UI Mmhmm UI Okay PM The uh the the digits in black UI Mmhmm PM Uh then its already visible in dark UI Okay PM So it it dont have to be a lightning or or a fancy well it can be for design of course UI Okay ID Okay ID Yeah yeah okay because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product UI Yes but theres a cost limitation too ID So Yeah twelve Euro fifty yeah UI Well thats more So thats a big problem I think ME Yeah UI I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that its not going to be a high highend product UI The cost price is very low ID Okay UI Um Okay PM Just remind something PM The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade ID Okay okay PM You have a m uh Always have s the soft buttons always uh clear the the the paint on it UI Very good point UI Yeah PM The marks UI Okay ID Okay um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now ID Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power UI Mmhmm UI Okay ID Because its very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week PM Yeah UI Okay ID So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah PM But um Necessary yeah ID I dunno its uh thats more Sebastians uh um Well does it PM Yeah UI Hmm PM But then Bluetooth uh might be problem PM Cause I think Bluetooth uh Yeah I know it from the cell phone UI Its use uh a lot of uh well Well cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and well its it seems to work uh quite okay ID Im not sure ID Uh Yeah UI So uh technically it will be possible PM But you cant you cant use Bluetooth all the time twenty four hours a day UI No you cannot ID Okay PM Does it Its over ID Gentlemen Im afraid we do not have any more time UI Okay ID Um so we will go back to our own uh work UI Okay ID Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um well you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it ID Um so this was it PM Okay ID See you in thirty minutes PM Great,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. The project manager then went over the project budget. The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow. The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. The project manager closed the meeting."
ID Welcome back PM Hello ME Hello ID Uh let me see PM Theres one of mine ID Okay ID Roo welcome back PM Hello Flores ID The waiting is for Sebastian ID There he is PM We have a slight problem UI Is there any time for a cup of coffee PM I opened uh the CD ROM box uh guys ID Sorry UI Can I get a cup of coffee ID Uh no UI Okay ID You cant sorry PM So just cancel it UI Well during my work I have no time either UI So I think so too ID Well this is life ID Sorry uh Roo PM Yeah I opened the CD ROM box ID Okay PM Accidentally ID Okay PM But its alright ID People welcome back with the second meeting ID Um for now on the schedule are a few points ID Uh first of all the opening which we are doing now ID Um second I received um some new project requirements ID Im not sure if you received them as well um but I will tell you about it PM Mmhmm ID Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation I think ID Sebastian ID Roo PM Yeah ID Ruud ME Almost ID Almost okay ID Then well do your one uh uh as la uh the last ID Um the top goal of this m Um we will figure that out PM But you cant upload your presentation from here I believe PM Okay ID Ca can you try to Yeah w we will see ME Uh if it if it if its wireless I could just uh put it in the PM I dont think its wireless here ID Um it is yeah UI It is PM Or it is UI It is PM Yeah PM Okay great ME Uh okay ID Yeah ID Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control so keep that in mind ID Um we have forty minutes ID So its now Yep ID Okay ID Um the new project requirements first of all um we didnt speak about it but we should not um support teletext in the remote um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext ID So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product ID Its a board decision ID Um the remote control should only be used for television because its not uh f uh feasible its not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with PM Yeah PM Time yeah ID Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty which is important for you uh Ruud and as well for uh Roo ID Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty ID Um then for Roo as well uh important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product ID So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product PM Yes ID Is that clear ID Any questions on these requirements ID No ID Okay ID Um the individual presentations I th um Roo or Sebastian who of you would like to start PM Yeah Ill start ID Uh uh yeah UI Yes ID Okay great PM Um Oh how can I uh Geez and sli and show PM Um Just uh press it PM Uh yes PM Alright PM Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion PM Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set PM So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do ID Yeah PM Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls the multifunction uh remote control with many possibilities but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion ID Mmhmm PM And the easeofuse remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons ID Yeah PM Um but um yeah PM My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control because uh the userfriendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design PM But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old ID Uhhuh PM So maybe um the multifunction can be implemented in uh in our design PM But it should b I think it should be a combination but teletext buttons are not uh in our design PM So it should uh take out well eight buttons or so PM But my in my opinion the the easy to use RC is uh the best uh possi possibility for us ID Okay ID Uh Ruud did you get that ME Yeah uh b uh most PM Yeah ID Okay so the important thing here is In the market yeah PM And its also i indeed uh uh Ruuds uh insight in the in the topic ME Oh userfriendly PM Yeah what what does the market want PM I I dont know ID Yeah okay w we will s we all uh Yeah PM Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control ID Okay ID Sebastian UI Okay UI Excuse me PM Scusi UI Um Okay its still the right thing UI Okay UI Um well there are some changes in the design requirements so there are some changes in the method also UI Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set UI And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set UI Well I th I tried to uh implement a picture here but its hardly readable PM Energies and uh Yeah UI Can you see it ID No its not visible UI No UI Well Um theres a energy source here UI And um basically there its connected to three things UI The user interface connected to a chip which is connected to the sender which generates messages using uh infrared light which are sent to the receiver UI Thats basically the idea UI And theres a little picture just for your imagination how a device like this should look or can look UI Okay UI Um what have I found UI Usually these kind of things consist of a battery infrared diode buttons chips and circuit board UI Thats all UI Its cased together nothing more than that UI Its almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every TV set is controlled infrared UI There are some exceptions but most of all have uh infrared controls UI And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons UI And I think thats what we w yes PM The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed UI In the and its a little more a little bit more fancy also UI So maybe we should consider that ID Yeah ID Okay UI Okay UI I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented UI Um basically this is all there is UI Theres just one chip UI There are a few buttons connected UI Uh the buttons are lit UI And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode and there is not a power source here UI So thats basically the total design of this piece of equipment UI Theres nothing more to it ID So its fairly easy UI Its fairly easy UI Its been done many times before and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this ID Okay PM Succeed in it also ID Okay good UI So Okay so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every TV set UI So I think that uh should be clear ID Okay UI Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse friendly components UI Uh there are specially uh designed um energyfriendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components UI And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energysave design we should really implement them UI Um for costeffectiveness we should really use a very lowcost uh circuit board um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment ID Okay UI And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff UI I think our uh users will really uh will really like that PM And whats the um if we use the LEDs i does it use much more energy or Okay UI No theyre p f uh power friendly LEDs also UI So we can use them UI So thats no problem PM For the same costs its can be uh in our Combined with the lowcost circuit board so its uh Yeah UI Uh no theyre uh theyre a little bit more expensive but by uh um um making We can we can make its I think ME Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most ME So the channel switching ID Yeah ME Or Hmm true ID Yeah but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques I guess UI Okay PM But I think Yeah I think its the same as in the cell phone just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons and not for Yeah but not for each button one LED I think UI Hmm UI Yes UI Well its not one light it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device UI No no no no UI Thats right thats right ID Okay UI So well this uh should be it ID Okay UI Um have a think about it ID Yeah ID Okay Ruud ME Oh mine is already outdated ID Okay well we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product ME Since uh Okay make Well Uh then Im sure the target market is uh ten million units ID So any income is welcome ID Input ME Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million PM Could you step a little bit more to the right ID Okay PM Yeah thank you ME But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market ME But uh since uh the requirements changed thats uh not a good idea ME Uh well skip this ID Yeah ME Well its this till true of course ME That they only use ten percent the buttons ME The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times when uh the power button is only used one time ME And the volume buttons only four times ME So theyre obv obviously uh the most important buttons ME And uh lots of people complained they kin cant find their remote control UI Mm ME So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them ME Some uh audio signal ME Like uh home phones ID Okay ME Or Yeah ID Well thats interesting UI Or a find a finding function you know PM Yeah ID Yeah thats definitely interesting UI Thats quite a yes ID It uh it separates our product from others uh as well PM Sound signal PM Yeah ID Okay go on UI Yes ME Well I just said that ME And uh well this obvious and he also said it ID Okay ID So thats what the market tells us ME Uh thats about it yes ID Yep ID Okay PM The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used ME Uh mo uh zap buttons most PM So Yeah well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons ME Volume they are uh use a lot ME But more than all the other buttons ME So Yeah thats uh a problem UI Yes PM And first um Yeah UI Yes we should focus on that I guess ID Yep UI Well the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties UI Theres no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment UI So um I dont think we have any hiccups there UI So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs UI So maybe its a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal PM Yeah the sound signal PM Just one thing Im just wondering the sound signal from where do you execute th the s sound UI Well Yes UI Th thats a bit of thats a problem PM Another device is not a solution ME Yeah ID Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands like um turning on and off the the the lights UI Usually Oh yes PM It should be uh uh Yeah but maybe youll uh get some new technologies for it UI Yes UI Well there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already UI Um there are video sets and um they have a special button the find the remote control button UI You press it and your TV set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound and your uh remote controls then start to beep ID Reports rep respend response to it UI And um Yes PM Yeah just like uh the phones the But but TVs dont have all uh uh buttons UI Yes thats it UI Yes same thing ME Yeah ID But uh th Yeah because we do not have a a a a a home um Okay UI No so we we should use something else ME And you Yeah and usually And even if the TV set would have such a button uh you would have to walk to your TV and its And b So if if youd be watching a movie it would constantly beep PM Uh But I believe you will have an Im convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us UI We do not control the TV set so well UI Yes m yes UI S and we b we want to make so its is easy as possible for our customers so we should think about Its quite complicated ID So what about the clapping technique ID Um because you se Well you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh Yeah a peak UI Well its quite complicated UI Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds UI Yes yes UI Well basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time ID Yeah ID Yeah UI But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control ID Yeah thats true UI Yes so we dont want that PM But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the TV UI Maybe we can Something like that PM Just a little antenna or uh something PM Well if you lost th I dont think people would bother walking to the TV and press that button because they lost the their remote UI Well is there not something f something more easily Well I dont think uh ID Well uh Yeah PM Uh thats just uh just a base station next to the TV is the best possibility UI No and y the the most important thing for people is that theres a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh UI And then uh the remote control uh reports itself so w we should use have uh we should use something like that UI You do not want another device which can be uh everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control UI Yes something like that UI But that will be very costly I think UI So thats not a good idea ID Yeah m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function if its possible within the costs and all that kind of things ME Yeah UI Mmhmm ID Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution because thats his his field of expertise UI I will PM Yeah UI Yes UI Yes UI But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also ID Mmhmm ID Yep UI Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used UI And there are some implepe imp Well I I think so because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control you cannot see it PM And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs the lightning uh function PM Its a unique item uh It will be an a unique feature of our remote control UI So Okay ID Yeah its a distinction in the market ID Its a different exactly ME Yeah ID Its an uni an unique feature and um I think um its worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights PM Yeah PM And just about uh the user interface I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control ID Yeah PM What should we choose in in design ID Yeah ID Well um according to Ruud um people do not use um all the extra features very very often PM Well the extra functions ID So Okay ME I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here ME Well t uh we wont support teletext which which was the thirdmost the secondmost used function PM Used option ID Okay ID Well we we do have a wise board so Im not questioning that ME Uh well yeah channel selection is obviously the most important ID Yeah ID Okay so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext ME So Yeah ID Well we skip that ME Yeah ME So Nope PM Well so it just th the basic functions ID Okay PM And we dont have to use it for DVD players uh and all kind of stuff UI No no ID No PM So Yeah UI So thats out of the question ID Yeah UI So I think also PM Just through uh the easy uh design ID Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one PM We can make uh a nice design when when theres not mu uh much buttons in it UI Yes PM So Uh just a few buttons trendy design nice lightning effects wh and the sound UI Well we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and Yeah thats right ID No ID Yeah ID Okay Ruud how do you feel about that ID Uh do you agree do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple Mmhmm ME Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might cause young people uh like new features ID Mm yeah ME So And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection you have the m two most important functions in one uh button ID Okay so this is is kind of uh Yeah UI Mm UI Okay UI Well is it maybe theres another possibility UI You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment but its quite elaborated uh because it has many functions UI Maybe its more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly easy to catch piece of equipment but um nevertheless Mmhmm ID But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons no display um I mean uh I guess its l its working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is UI Mmhmm UI Ok like that UI Well I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by by these kinds of sticks or something like that UI I dont know if if its userfriendly UI Thats your field of expertise PM Yeah I dont know yet ID Because we do not implement uh a user history UI Mmhmm UI Theres no but theres no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system ID I know but but if we use uh like a stick for example um Yeah UI W Mmhmm UI Well maybe we can use a light for that UI When you move the stick to a to a position maybe uh a light next to it can lit up UI So you know Ive just uh pushed the button or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume UI Something like that UI Yes ID Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions PM But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick uh like many cell phones just a round m well should we just use a Um its already uh oh we have a blank ID Yeah draw draw it on the board PM Oh UI Oh yeah something like that UI Its not really a stick but Yes PM Its just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions UI Yes PM Instead of a stick PM A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when its falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick I think UI Hmm ID Yeah it can break down UI Yes yes ME Yeah UI And Yes and this also looks more fancy I think UI I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public I think PM Yeah ME A younger uh Huh UI But youre the marketing man ME And its also quite easy to use so itll it uh attract younger people because well new and it might attract older people because its easy to use PM Geez PM Well volume and something uh like that ID Uhhuh PM The programme up and down ID Okay yeah PM And the vol yeah the pen doesnt uh really does what I want UI Okay thats good ID Okay but w we still were still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options ID Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques ID Um however uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things ID We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the userfriendliness UI Mmhmm PM But I think our our next step to look at is just that PM So I dont think its um we have something to do PM Uh we cant discuss it right now because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that I think ID Um well for we do have to uh decide this this meeting PM Yes ID Yeah ID We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience PM Mmhmm UI Okay PM Kay but teletext is so uh is just scrapped UI Okay UI Do do you want a list of functions UI Do you want an explicit list UI Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ID Um well I do not want a full uh its not necessary to to have a full list but I want um the kind of functions for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting UI Okay UI Okay UI Mmhmm PM The ten digits ID Well for example that thats what we should think about ID l how is the remote going to look PM Oh and just one function ID Not not in the user interface but Yeah PM The the the the programme to programme button the switch to uh two channels when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six just one button which which can uh change yeah UI Mmhmm UI Yes ID A bit of a split mode UI Change ID Uh l like Yeah UI Yes yes ID Dual channel watch UI Yes PM Yeah ID Okay well um m maybe I should write that down UI Well youre the secretary ID Uh Ruud um whats your last name ME Mielsen ID Mielsen because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen ID Right ID Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder ID So if you want to have a look at it you know where to find it UI Mm okay but make a s make a subfolder for it because its starting to fill up already PM Alright ID Um Yeah thats thats if you want to do it Sebastian ME Yeah UI Sure PM Our BSC uh W uh The ten digits ID Okay um Okay so so um uh Volume ID Programme ID Uh dual channel ID Uh And and do we want um the ten digits UI Yes thats important PM Yeah I believe so UI Well are are you sure ME Well if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button UI Im not so sure PM Yeah UI Well thats complicated but is that so relevant ID Yeah UI Because I dont think but you should uh shou you should know that PM I wouldnt buy it personally UI If it were so PM A remote control without the ten digits UI Okay I can imagine when I can imagine when youre when you have a satellite decoder and and you have well about six hundred channels I can imagine you want this PM Uh and I think the most Just elder elder people would would buy it but Yep ID I agree actually ME Well But Yeah and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience they will probably watch more channels than the older people UI But if youre uh a regular TV user and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks well you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons ID But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels UI Thats enough PM The older people only use five of them UI Well but how how often do you watch all these channels ID Often ME So Well And And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it UI No youre probably right PM Yeah UI Okay UI But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull UI Dont you think ID Well it depends on the on the on the looks on the on the You c you can d make them very fancy by um I mean Nokia they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy UI The design PM On the design UI Okay UI Well y then there should be should done be done something specific with it UI Mmhmm PM Yeah ID So Im Im I do not agree Uh Exactly exactly UI Okay so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour that kind of thing UI Okay ME Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement but it would be a solution uh for Yeah ID Okay speech UI Well maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control PM Yeah UI So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control uh its very easy to change uh the channel ID Yeah UI Thats one thing UI And its very easy uh to find your remote control ID To find yeah UI So maybe thats a possibility but Im afraid it will be a bit costly UI But maybe when we uh Mmhmm ID Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume because maybe people do not always want to use their voice um Yeah UI Okay UI Okay okay ME Especially elder people uh dont like voice recognition ME So then we should implement such a but Yes ID But we do focus on younger people ID We d it its a board uh decision UI Okay UI Well UI I I think it should uh should work it sh we should manage that PM So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition ID Okay UI Yes UI Well the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage UI Its mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function PM Mmhmm UI So thats thats a big advantage I think ID Okay ID Okay g good ID Okay UI Theres only one disadvantage uh by implementing this UI Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult UI So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries ID Mm UI But maybe can we we can think something smart about it ID Yep UI There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries ID Okay UI So when you just leave the device in a in a light room it charges itself ID But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs UI You have to do nothing for it ME M And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge then there wouldnt be uh a big problem ID Because it seems like a very Is a cradle very cheap PM Twelve dollar fifty UI Maybe maybe not UI Ill have to find that out UI Yes UI So No thats very cheap ME Cause when Yeah UI Its Oh its very cheap UI Thats no problem UI Its just a a case with two uh metal contacts ID I know b uh but there should be an adapter as well UI Its Yes but theyre theyre mass production UI Theyre very cheap UI So it will cost us p practically nothing ID Okay ID Okay ID We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting ID Um I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about yeah but that are important ID Uh Ruud you you came up with the voice recognition uh data ID Uh are there other things about the market we should know ME Um I think we dealt with the most important information ME Just that the younger part of uh the market isnt the forty percent we uh want to sell to ME So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people ME But with uh buttons like that which are easy to use we uh might attract them too ID Okay ME So I dont think thats a big problem Yes ID Okay UI Yeah ID Okay so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable UI Profitable ME Yeah profitable ID We we yeah we still need to take in account the the bit older people ME Yes ID Okay ID O okay ID Um Roo PM I have nothing uh nothing to add I think ID Nothing to add ID Sebastian UI Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities ID Yeah ID Great UI Um so uh basically weve decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design UI So on the outside it looks easy but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside UI So thats one the those are the choices we have to make UI But I think theres a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques uh voice recognition that these kinds of things ID Mmhmm ID Yeah UI Um it makes it also more uh attractable I think to our uh audience UI Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques which uh I think our customers will like UI The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime energy saving ID Yep UI Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons UI If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition uh our circuit board will become even more cheap UI So thats another well it wa it w it was an issue but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible ID Yeah and that was the main issue right ID The the board Yeah UI And this even uh makes it more cheapy UI So Mmhmm PM But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ID The board PM The circuit board UI The circuit board PM The fewer buttons you can use on it UI The fewer buttons you have the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board yes ID No its th yeah PM Yeah okay ID Its the other way around yeah PM Yeah UI And its very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit a chip UI So thats thats another advantage ID It shouldnt be a big issue PM Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition UI So Yes because I dont know Yes UI I d I really dont know UI So It can be costly PM No ID Okay UI Maybe not ID Im not sure how how well f uh determine the costs I will have a look at it ID Maybe you will get some information on that UI Yes ID Um Im not sure how how that Yep UI Yes I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it ID Okay great ID Um well I think were qui quite done PM Were done I think ID Um for now we will have the lunch break UI How nice ID Um Im dont know how long the break will be but well find out PM Me neither ID Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work uh and Im sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it ID Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder ID If you want to look at it um well just do ID Um the Interface Designer um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept ID Uh Roo um from you I would like to see Uh Im sorry yeah Im sorry PM Interface industrial PM Yeah ID User Interface Designer uh Roo I would like to see the user interface c uh concept UI Well we understand ID And um Well i it should be easy thats w w what we concluded PM Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes UI Well Mm yes PM About the voice recognition PM Well Yeah ID It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons ID S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one ID And um um yeah some some fancy lights ID I think thats what we decided UI So we drop the voice recognition ID No no no we didnt but it shouldnt be integrated yeah its of course its user interface but um i I was talking about really the design of the No UI Or Oh UI Okay UI Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ID We can decide the next meeting UI Okay ID Yep UI Because Ill have some updated info on that uh Adapt ID Yeah ID I guess all of you have i updated info ID Im sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching PM Yep ID And Im sure the market will um uh uh will change adapt and um so we will see that ME Hmm PM Adapt ME Left ME Hmm ID Um yeah thats it for now PM Thats it PM Kay ID Any other questions or can we have the lunch UI We can have the lunch ME Yeah ID Yeah okay PM Ill take the lunch ID Good,"There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design."
ID Do you need to change anything on it ME Um Mm dont think so ID Because otherwise I will already open it ID Okay ME Unless uh things have suddenly change again ID Is it much changes ME Uh dont know ME Maybe uh youve got new information like uh last time ID Uh I didnt No no ID I do hot have Only the same information ME Okay ID Hello Sebastian UI Hello hello Mister PM ID I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well in the control room UI Well thats where the thinking goes on ID Oh its that Roo again always late ID Bongiorno PM Bongiorno UI I think you should punish him UI Youre the PM ID Hmm PM Punish ID I see some interesting okay UI Possibilities yeah PM You wish ID People welcome back PM Welcome ID The third meeting PM Uh Yeah ME Oop ID Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out ID Um first of all um if you make minutes yourself as well uh like Sebastian does um could you put them on the shared folder ID If you do not make minutes no problem but its easy for me to see what you uh wrote down so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report ID Um the second thing um I was th uh s thinking to myself I have this little remote control and Im talking to it but I still need to point to the television because it works with infrared ID Thats quite strange UI Yes ID Okay UI So Not at all ID Well come to that later I g I think ID Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any prediscussion questions PM No ME No ID Okay ID Um we wi we will have your individual presentations uh then the decision on the remote control concept um and uh the closing ID Forty minutes in total for this ID So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations um the progress youve made UI Okay ID Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruuds um information first because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation ME Kay ME Hmm PM Alright ME Oh UI Just press the okay button it works ME Yeah Okay ID Um yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah ME My method UI How surprising ME Well findings ME Uh Ease of use is important but uh innovation is more important and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important ME And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes shoes and furniture and that they want spongy material ME Probably watch too much Sponge Bob ME Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours ME Simple shapes uh m material ME But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group Kay ID Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide UI Oh wait uh wait up ID Um because Im taking minutes and it Um were the important themes enclose ID Yeah okay ID The feel of to be spongy Okay so so yeah it might not be t uh it it shouldnt be too hard UI Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ME Well uh one example given was this so um I assume they just want something colourful ME Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something UI Not something dull UI Okay PM But they like dark colours you said in the p Okay ME No uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects PM Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow ME But Which one PM I had Or we could make oh UI But can you can you go back to that slide UI The uh just one slide back no no no ME This UI Yes UI Okay and the feel of the material has to be spongy ME Yes UI Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also do you think ME Uh well it might ME But personally I wouldnt like a sponge as a remote control ME But Maybe soft material or something ME But not a real sponge ID It it maybe it rubber or or yeah ME Yeah exactly ID Okay ME Yeah and like uh the older group likes familiar materials but that doesnt mean we should use wood So Well this this is an example of what they would like UI Okay ME But since were conten concentrating on uh the younger group I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones exch exchangeable covers ID Yeah ME So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like ID Well thats interesting UI Its quite interesting ID You could make a few v very colourful ones and uh a very traditional co cover PM Yeah o o Im thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens UI Yes PM The yellow uh rubber telephone ID Yeah yeah PM Its the its the rubber uh cover ID Yeah it is it is i yeah PM And its uh colourful PM It looks likes a banana ID Yeah PM We have the fruit we have the colours ID Do you know the phone PM We have the simple design UI I dont know the phone but I can imagine it ID Its the Siemens uh C twenty five I believe its its the one the Postbank uh gave away the very You kn you know Ruud as well PM Um thirty five UI Oh that one yes PM And the b the light blue and its also in yellow UI Now I kn uh oh I know I know UI Yes I Ive seen it UI Ive seen it ID About th Okay ME Ive seen it but Kay ID Okay ID Um uh okay ID Do you have uh thit that was Okay ME Uh thats about it ID Okay so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group ME Yes ID And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials ME Uh soft material ID Okay UI So So ease of use is important but technology is twice as important UI And what was even more important ME Uh the fancy look and feel UI Okay UI So thats the most important thing for our customers ME Yes ME Apparently ID Okay Roo could you do your presentation PM Yeah PM Mmhmm PM Well I dont ha really have much to add um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion PM Um Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume ID Okay well its good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about PM Well a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these PM These are both with uh with voice recognition but theyre very advanced and very hightech and just um well a weird um shape ID Shape PM So I suggest I couldnt uh I had a small uh mockup uh sign on the on paper PM But it didnt work PM My pen didnt load um the information PM So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint PM But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control UI Mmhmm UI But its its kind of uh its kind of o organic so thats very good PM Uh yellow ID Yeah ME Yeah ID And what Im thinking about maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control UI Yes ID Um it shouldnt be too uh glatt too slippery s because um Yeah UI Slippery PM But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone its rubber UI You have to grab it PM So its easy in your hand Uh indeed ID Yeah exactly ID Yeah UI Yes UI There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in so you can get a really good grip on it ID Yeah ex for your fingers yeah PM Yeah UI So you you dont have to um attain much pressure to it UI Its its a lot easier ID Yeah UI So m Yes ID It grips automatically ID Yeah okay UI But Ill Ill go into that deeper in my presentation ID Okay good PM Great PM Oh and um to add on um Ruuds information in this um interface we can have uh hightech with the voice recognition and uh well the the fancy colours and uh and so on and still have the ease of use because we have an easy interface PM And all the other remote controls are hightech in buttons and uh and so on ID Yeah ID Way too much I think for our goal yeah PM Yeah PM So if you have the voice recognition you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it ID Okay b but I think well yeah UI Okay but Ill Ill go into that because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities UI Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design UI Uh these are the things weve looked at UI And of course I used the web to uh find my information UI About the casing we have three different casing possibilities UI We have the uncurved or flat case UI Uh thats the most common uh remote con control form uh were used to is just a it ju its just a box UI Im sorry I I dont have any pictures of uh of this thing UI We have uh a curved one UI Its uh curved in two dimensions UI You have to imagine its a bit like a wave form UI So its uh a little more advanced in its in its shape ID Okay UI Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape which is curved in three dimension UI I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation PM Yeah UI The the big remote control something like that PM Right UI But its quite uh advanced and its its quite daring to to use I think UI Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing UI We can use plastic which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice but you can give it any colour uh which is the same for rubber but its not slippery UI We can use wood and titanium UI Well um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases UI And these latex cases theres theres just the plastic ones uh wont allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source UI Which brings me to the different energy sources UI Um well we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls UI You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d It would be very new but its a kind of a retro uh style I think PM Great ID Well it would be very new to the market but Yeah UI Uh Well this is quite interesting UI Uh theres theres also a kinetic energy supply UI So um when youre watching TV uh or when youre you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall whatever you wish PM Like the watch UI It have it it has to move thats the the sense of it UI And you can store the energy in the in the thing ID I think um if if I can hook on to that um the kinetic thing is very funny UI Mmhmm UI Its very funny indeed ID I mean solar is of course its nice but its well your uh your calculator has a solar panel UI Mmhmm UI Indeed ID Um hand dynamo Well maybe m Yeah I know PM But if youre watching a movie how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also UI Mmhmm PM You you walk and uh but uh you youre sitting on a couch UI Yes ID Yeah UI But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy UI the the shaking of your body which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake uh it charges it UI But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy UI So I think uh you have a problem when youre watching a movie and uh you havent moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time and you want t to switch uh the channel or something well m it might not work ID Yeah ID And wha Okay UI So thats something you have to keep in mind UI So but maybe maybe theres a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries so we can save on the batteries and um when theres enough kinet kinetic energy use the kinetic energy and otherwise use the batteries ID Yeah ID Okay because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power UI Uh yes it does ID Yeah UI Ill come to that later ID Okay UI And we of course have the traditional uh solar power which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity UI The user interface controls um of course we have the pushbuttons and uh we also have scrollwheels UI And these scrollwheels can also be integrated with buttons UI So its just like a mouse UI You can scroll em you can also push it UI Um uh in the indicators we have the LCD displays which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scrollbuttons which are just two of these things PM Mmhmm UI So we dont really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting the the thing with the the round with the four Yes PM Mmhmm PM Oh we can just make four pushbuttons in a form of a round UI That is possible too UI Yes PM But I th I dont think uh the scrollwheels I had some I had some information about it too UI Mmhmm PM I dont think theres any possibility for us to use scrollwheels ID Well This will be the remote right PM I d I cant see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scrollwheel with a button on it UI Well mayb uh well m me neither UI Maybe when you integrate some functions PM Yeah ID Um with uh maybe a channel selector ID What about integrating a scrollbar on this side PM Yeah uh thats a possibility but But Flores think about a scenario where y where you would use the scrollbutton for A volume okay UI Uh its do its done before ID Because this is how you keep it Volume UI Yes UI Its quite quite good yes UI Well its it well i what he means is theres an button integrated in the scrollwheel UI Theres no scenario where you use uh the button in the scrollwheel UI You just use the wheel ID Well what about mute UI About mute UI Well yes ID Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button UI Okay UI Yes ID And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device UI Well okay UI Well that that thats one possibility okay UI Well okay ID And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market UI Its quite goods ID So Im looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones UI Mmhmm UI Yes ID So maybe um I guess that thats something you two uh need to think about PM Yeah ID Uh Ruud wha what do you thing about uh a scrollbar ME Um Uh well its obvious obviously new ID Uh scrollwheel PM Wheel ME So it might attract uh the young customers UI Hmm ID Okay UI But its done before uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio pocket radios UI We use this ID Yeah UI And Well its its been done years ago and I dont see it anywhere now UI So maybe its not no ID Well all the Sony telephones use it for example for volume ID Nokia has a well okay its not really a scrollwheel but on their side th the the volume button is on the side because you gri grab it like this UI Hmm UI Yes but it uses two separate buttons ID Yeah ID I know its not really a scrollwheel UI It doesnt use a ID No ID Yeah UI Well UI Uh something for uh Roo here ID For you too yeah PM Yeah I believe uh if you have uh what weve earlier said um the grip uh places in in the remote control PM You have your hand on one place on the remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb UI Wi within reach UI Yes you have to PM So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect UI Yes UI yes UI Yeah yeah ID Okay UI Okay ID Sebastian ID Um Yeah UI Okay um we have to know if you want to use uh these rubber doublecurved c uh case um you must use these push uh pushbuttons UI Theres no way you can integrate LCD displays UI Theres no way you can integrate scrollwheels because its all curved UI Theres there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things UI So thats a limitation UI About um the components uh just the hardware UI We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal UI Uh we have a simple regular and advanced chip UI And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which is a little cryptic uh to me UI But I think thats the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about PM Yeah yeah you can um I have some information about it PM Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up UI Mmhmm UI Okay UI Okay UI So so okay PM Of mute lets say mute PM Um you programme it you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that thats really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control it repeats uh your saying UI Mmhmm UI Yeah PM So thats the sample sensor UI Okay PM So if you say mute it says mute again and then its um well I believe its uh Yeah and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is UI Mmhmm ID It performs the action ID Yeah UI Okay PM So you say mute he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute and then goes to the mute function ID Yeah UI Okay UI Okay so thats basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for UI Okay UI This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip I thought UI Um no op Im not very sure UI No its not in here UI If we want to use the LCD display we really need the advanced version which is a bit l little bit more costly UI If we want to use the scrollwheels we need the regular version UI And if we dont want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip which is a bit cheaper ID Okay ID Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display UI Okay ID To No UI Um no but I think thats something for uh Roo here to think about PM Yeah PM Well I dont have um I havent looked for uh for information about it but I dont think information uh y I dont think you need it on a display PM Especially when when we have to look at a cost I dont think uh cause uh uh all any TV can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen yeah UI I I dont think either UI No UI I dont think you need it ID On screen display ID Yeah UI Okay ID Okay th Okay UI Okay well my conclusion um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought UI I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing but they seem to like natural uh stuff UI So maybe we should think about uh wood finish UI Um Ive chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy UI Its more reliable its cheaper UI So I dont think we should use the dynamo thing ID Good ID Kineti okay UI The kinetic thing it its its a possibility ME Hmm UI Its its more advanced but Im I think you should combine it with batteries ID Okay its maybe a bit too too flashy too yeah UI Otherwise it will not too advanced uh well UI Its in in in some way it can give us an advance because you will save on your batteries UI But Yes ID Yeah but that thats the same with the solar cell ID Thats no different UI And I think its more robust UI Its more uh Uh its more functional ID Yeah ID Okay PM But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs PM So if you use titanium Okay ID No no but the uh um thats what Sebastian said UI The titanium thing uh we have to skip it ID He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference ID But but yet I understood that the market is different PM Oh sorry PM Yeah ID So um No r rubber with colours UI So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff and we should uh use wood or something like that PM Yeah ME And yeah the yeah the older people liked wood PM And I would think And they can be implemented with a regular chip UI Oh okay sorry UI So it it needs to be rubber ME No the Yeah the younger people liked soft material ID Colourful and Yeah UI Okay UI Okay spongy materials ME Yeah UI Okay um well um these scrollwheels I think uh they they can be they can be handy UI So Yes they can UI But they really need the regular chip you cannot use the sa simple Well Im not very sure PM Okay but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh evalu But most infrared uh remote controls dont have to be pointed at all UI Maybe thats an uh a different I think so if you if you stick with the the simple uh straightforward uh not curve design i uh its too dull ID But but do we want the curved uh uh design or I its too dull ME Yeah ID Yeah UI I dont think c our customers will like it UI And um if you uh take the doublecurved uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scrollwheels ID Yeah UI So I think this is the best of two worlds ID Okay ID Okay ID Okay what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ID Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue UI Yes ID Because it its of cour Yeah UI Its its uh I uh I can imagine its very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device UI Its very unlogical UI Well the there has to be some pointing at ID Well It depends also on your on your Well it depends on your walls actually UI But All lights get absorbed yeah PM Well if you if you take your hand before it okay it wont work but you can point it just to the other wall ID If you have uh have um smooth walls it it it probably youre probably right PM Yeah ID But if you have carpets on the wall which our natural loving friends probably do have then um yeah th th it might be a bit more of a issue UI Yes because the walls they they reflect the infrared light ID So Yeah UI So it has an its easier UI Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample UI Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker UI Um with a with a regular chip PM And the regular chip UI I think uh it gives us the advantage of Yes yes PM And and the scroll uh scrollwheels PM Yeah ID I like the scroll wheels uh idea UI And uh skip and skip the LCD part ID Yeah UI I dont think it its any uh value added thing PM No UI So Okay PM Think so too ID Well it looks uh yeah well um according to Ruud the the the market likes um new flashy technology and I mean LCD is well ok I know but its m its less um s standard than than Well we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part UI Technology UI Yes UI Its not very flashy and new ME Standard ID Thats the problem UI Mmhmm ID Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance I would say do integrate it because it it adds a little ext extra hightech feeling to it UI Mmhmm UI Yes PM But we already have the scrollwheels the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition the rubber the fancy colours ID Mm yeah UI Uh I think our customers will go insane ID Okay okay UI Its its too much ID Yeah ID Okay I I agree ID I think i Ruud do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or No ME Nah um n no I dont think so ME M Hmm ID Sebast uh nee Roo ID Roo do you have any other Nothing more PM Um no PM Nothing more ID Um Sebas Well we we need to describe uh decisions now UI Okay UI Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f Flores UI Okay ID So um on the energy well we decided UI So i Okay ID Chip UI Okay ID The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve UI Okay okay ID User interface um Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product PM Uh but uh cant scrollwheels uh work with one uh onecurved case UI Yes they can work PM Yeah okay PM Sorry yeah UI They cannot work with doublecurved PM Oh sorry UI Thats thats problem PM Yeah UI Ill check it for you ID I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian ID Uh you talked about it before the colours grey and yellow PM Yeah ID Keep it in mind ID And um the buttons well we talked about it now ID The next phase um Sebastian um is um the design of the look and feel UI Yes UI Mmhmm ID The user interface design ID And for you the product evaluation ID Um Im sure your personal coach will give you more information on that ID Um and uh the ID and the UID need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard UI Okay ID And Im going uh to plan my holidays UI Okay UI So you will be on the Bahamas PM The project drawing is for the next Yeah right UI Uh Okay ID Yeah its its uh when we come back in thirty minutes uh you will have a uh prototype ready UI So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions weve made ID Yeah ID I can ID Um maybe one of you could write it down UI Ill do ID Great ID Um Uh you you need to help me ID Um The casing is curved singlecurved UI Okay UI W start with the casing PM Singlecurved UI Okay singlecurved case UI Okay UI What about the energy source ID Traditional batteries uh and solar PM But can there be uh wor can they work together PM Or do we have to choose between them PM Cause if we have to choose yeah ID No they can be complementary UI I I think they can ID Uh al al I uh Every device Yeah UI Yes PM Okay UI Well uh It it should be PM What if not UI There should be really no problem UI They can be supplementary PM Okay UI Thats no problem UI So So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar ID Okay um th Battery and solar yeah UI Okay UI What about uh the finishing of the case UI We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ID Yeah with colourful rubber PM Yeah ID Uh if its possible with uh different um covers but Im not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish UI Okay and I think we should use the company colours UI Something like black and red UI uh black and yellow ID Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow PM Grey and yellow UI Grey yellow okay ID Yeah PM Yellow case and grey buttons I think ID Yeah although I dont think thats very colourful ID Except for the yellow of course but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours UI Oh I think its uh its not very dull UI Its quite modern actually UI Dont you think ID Well I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before PM I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button PM And um Well well Well there is ID Well it it doesnt have to be red ID Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for ID Um so maybe it shouldnt even be two colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group I guess UI Hmm UI Okay ME Or black and yellow ID Black and yellow yeah UI Okay but uh Im afraid its not possible to print a picture on uh the device UI Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself UI But Oh Ive read PM Just a week ago a keyboard manufacturer would print with and uh No ME Yeah UI Yes UI Yes but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques UI Theyre actually very slow in its techniques ID Okay so we have to deal with wh whats possible here UI So So Im afraid its not possible ID Yeah ID Okay ID Um more f more more decisions we made ID Um Um The scrollheel PM A scrollwheel ID Yes the voice recognition we already decided PM Voice recognition of course UI Okay so scrollwheel UI But there will be some additional buttons I guess ID Yeah UI And th the they should be spongy also because theyre theyre rubber too ID Uh Im going to leave that up to you two PM What what did you say UI Well uh you can use well when you use the buttons theyll theyll be made of rubber too UI So it has th the spongy uh feel also PM Yeah ID Yeah UI So I I think thats okay PM Yeah or you could use plastic buttons PM In the rubber ID I think rubber is nice ID Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button and what do they want spongy uh uh devices or or i PM Yeah b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually PM What I said in the in the first uh discussion uh the digit six on the button it will disappear when its from rubber ID Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so PM It is not uh something uh its no information I read about it or so but its just from No but but uh it Yeah b yeah ME Uh didnt did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ME Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button ID Yeah ID You could place a um uh this this would be the button ME There the icons ID The scrollwheel I mean ID And you could place the indica th th the signals the No no theres no painting only uh yellow or But its into the rubber UI Yes ME So you dont touch the icons that much UI Thats okay PM Yeah thats possible but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case PM So still then if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you rub on the painting PM Yeah PM Yeah but but the the plus or the minus UI Yes the signs PM You have to draw the Yeah its on the cover ID Yeah but this is on the pla yeah I know ID Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean PM So if you uh You just move the problem ID What about um making this rubber and making this plastic UI Uh I see what you mean UI Well maybe thats possible because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing UI So maybe they can combine these two ID Yeah ID Well actually we should have it the other way around I guess ID A plastic cover with rubber finishing ID I mean this is this is the finishing ID This is um whats on the edge ID What you feel UI Yeah ID But the front on which the the buttons are doesnt have to be rubber UI Mmhmm ID I mean I know but do you touch this or do you touch this UI Well Im Im not so sure I think it c should be Well Im not sure I have to ask with manufacturing but Im Im not sure thats what you want because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and thats what you get with rubber PM Y uh can you separate these uh these I do UI So if you want the spongy feel you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber ID I mean I I never touch between the buttons UI I think both UI I do PM Or the s uh the sideways UI I think Okay PM Or the the back ID Yeah the side exactly the sideways PM Or the back ID The side but do you touch between the the these buttons PM I think Yes especially when there are l a few buttons on it you have uh a lot of space to touch PM So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it ID Okay ID Well we do not have very much time uh left ID Um I guess you two have to figure that out PM Yeah ID Im going to leave the decision to you um because you have to make its prototype and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers the possibilities and uh so Im going to leave it the decision with you PM Yeah ID Um Sebastian did you write enough decisions down UI Um not quite UI Um what about uh the chips UI We use the regular chip PM Regular UI Okay ID Yeah UI And Well no I think thats about it PM Use with UI Yes ID Okay ID With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions ID The chip is is not really Okay well UI The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports LCD UI Thats all UI And weve decided not to use LCD ID Yeah UI So Okay ID Okay ID Um okay then I think we are uh quite finished ID Um Ill see you guys in thirty minutes and um Yeah PM For the finishing touch ID Yeah um if you write wrote anything down uh could you put it on the shared folder UI Okay PM Uh yeah ID Yeah PM But um Sebastian has everything ID I know but well Great UI Ill put it online ID Right,"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours."
PM Thats the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button UI Like this one PM But uh we dont uh we dont uh we do think its um well what if with ease of use w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers UI Its important UI Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve UI Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control UI And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions and then they will not use this dial as often UI But other users who are new to this device need something like that ID Okay UI They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume so its easier for them Yeah maybe so ID Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ID A a and the voice recognition as well th maybe you could uh could uh Yeah UI Yes its Well its its its another approach its more that our um UI There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device UI Its its quite easy ID Okay ID Okay good ID And and the case is is rubber UI Yes rubber ID And the buttons PM Plastic or rubber UI There are plastic or rubber PM Well yeah ID Okay and uh the colouring UI Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that ID with with grey or black UI Whatever cost uh cost uh the least ID Okay well well come to that later ID Um okay ID Anything else to add or Yeah UI No UI Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons ME Well you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button cause you have to assign two channel new channels UI But Yes but it but these are tasks that are only executed once I think ID M uh yeah UI Or not ID M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice voice recognition ME You Yes UI Well okay UI Okay yeah thats right UI Or something li like that PM And a button for disabling the voice recognition ID Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n dont know two three seconds you could also say it youd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay that thats not really really important UI Yes PM Yeah PM Thats the basic idea yeah ID The basic okay PM Of our prototype ID Okay ID Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ID Okay ME Uh my name is not name but Uh well I used the the uh documents ID You are nameless ME And these uh were the most important criteria ME It should be ME yeah thats uh how the fashion guys uh state it UI Is it spongy ME Fancy look and feel ME So Uh well appar Yeah but apparently uh we shouldnt evaluate yet PM So just walk through it step by step PM I mean is it fancy everything I believe uh I believe its fancy UI I believe its fancy too ID No PM Oh sorry ME So Yeah I think these are the most important criteria UI Okay ID Okay so this these are the cr uh the criteria ID Okay well the then well switch to my presentation ME So uh thats about it ID Um The production costs ID The costs are not under Can I Um this is the Yeah its its w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty PM Twenty two PM Yikes ID And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell UI Well its very expensive ID So I guess we should skip that because its not that important UI Okay PM Why does the price and and the s oh one uh exa yeah ID Yeah the the price the the number of items and the the sum PM The number of uh yeah UI Okay ID Um well this is what I would call our luxury model ID Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty um then I did the following changes PM And and does it But thats thats only for the buttons ID Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells um by not using the voice recognition feature because its uh its a four Euro uh addition to the price UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID Um Yeah I believe Uh pushbutton well It makes it the thirteen yeah ID Pushbuttons are buttons are are not the most expensive but do add extra cost UI Hmm ID So um yeah th this design is not um within our price model UI Okay ID Um Yeah UI But Im afraid its not complete UI Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials the last item UI And you have not added one item there UI So its c way too expensive ID Its still too expensive yeah ID Um I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out um oh PM So the button we can use plastic ID And uh maybe not use the special form PM And the pla uh And a plastic b just plastic buttons a plas uh instead of rubber UI But it Yes ID It becomes a very dull remote control I know ID But its the board decision ID Um And um yeah UI Well b basically it when when this is our only option we should even consider changing the casing because I think theres very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions ID Yeah ID Yeah I know UI So Type of m maybe another market segment ID Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh Yeah m uh maybe not not all that fancy but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um Yeah UI Yeah UI Yes UI Thats maybe thats better UI Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple but thats not what uh has been asked ID Yeah ID I know I know UI So we should kick the boards uh Well Hmm ID Yeah ID Although I think we yeah but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already ID Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people UI Yes ID Um but uh I agree its its not a fancy hightech uh device ID Definitely not no ID Its not that innovative ID Or however you s pronounce that ID Um so okay PM Yeah too bad ID Um Oh this is the wrong one ID So uh that means redesign ID We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product PM Mmhmm ID Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went ID Um Im not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first ID I guess Yeah ME Um well since were not gonna manufacture it anyway Uh Yay ID Yeah thats true UI Well maybe its good to do it anyway because if we evaluate it we we can also determine if our objectives are good ID We l we can learn ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So Is it fancy ID I agree ID Well I d it is it is Yeah I think so ME Is it ME Is it fancy PM Um the yellow rubber I think so UI I think so ID You like the rubber uh Roo PM Im into it ME So uh one UI But its not that fancy ID Yeah ID No Ill Ill Ill give it a two UI I mean I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing UI It would be even more oh you really like titanium ID You like tita Thats a flavour as well UI Im Im into it UI It has flavour UI Yes thats right UI You should taste it ID Right ID Um Yeah I know but but it but thats fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of Yeah ME Is it uh And w yeah w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials UI It has to do with fashion I guess UI So do Okay PM Its trendy trendy fun yeah ME So in that way It its fancy ID Yeah ID It applies ID It yeah PM Well just give it a two ID Yeah UI Yes UI I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the doublecurved case PM Its not the ultimate uh fancy two but Yeah but thats sti thats uh Looking at the user uh needs we only uh dont we dont have the doublecurved case UI It would have been even more fancy but we decided not to because if we use a doublecurved case we could not use solar UI So Yes PM We w we do have uh the rubber we do have the colours PM Thats two out of three PM So I believe uh we are close uh to two ID Yeah I I agree UI Yes I agree too UI Its okay UI We did yes we did good ME Okay and uh was it innovative ID Well with the voice recognition feature and uh No we are evaluating this this uh design now PM But thats not in it ME Yep PM Ov or can we Okay UI Well lets lets this product UI So I I I think it is ID This prototype UI I think its innovative ID Yeah PM And the scroll uh wheel PM The solar not many remotes have the solar I think UI No UI It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source but its its way too yes but I think uh its a two ME Yeah and uh So uh also a uh two ID That would have been a thrill ID Yep ME Is it easy to use ID Im not sure PM Yeah ID Im not sure PM Well yeah the voice recognition of course is hard to learn I think PM Well hard its not for the for the e for the elderly UI Well but there are two parts in this remote control PM They wont use it UI What you see here is is the basic part UI Everybody can use it so thats easy to use ID Yeah UI Thats for a novice user UI When you have a more advanced elaborate user well such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions UI So in that in that way it is advanced and I think its easy to use for for both uh types of users ID Yeah UI So uh Its maybe its not very uh easy for Okay PM I think I think a three PM Wouldnt give it more ID Uh Im doubting doubting as well ID Um Yeah ME Well the p the most important function is easy to use ME The the zapping channel switching volume ME But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder ID Okay ID Uh two or three ID Three ID Wha wh what would be your guess ID I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions ID Its the uh its its overall ID Is the device easy to use UI Yeah thats right UI Youre right in that but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use because he is already he or she is already an advanced user ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So After all I think personally I would give a two ID Um Okay UI But So its two two and three ID Uh Roo a three PM Yep ID Ruud ME Good question ME Uh Ill go uh for the two ID Okay UI Two threes UI So thats ten ID So I could make it e easy PM If you make it a four it will be three in general UI So thats w No two and a half PM If he makes it a four UI Six and four PM Not a three UI Six and four is ten UI Divided by four is two and a half UI So Yes PM Darn PM Nee ME Hmm ID Roo ME Huh PM A seven a three No ME Yeah PM A four and a three together ME I yeah UI Four PM Yeah you have a two he has a two ME Yeah two two three No UI Two PM Three PM And a three ID No I havent said anything yet PM Nee PM I know ID Okay but if I would say a three then its six and four is ten UI Divided by four ID Divided by four is two point five PM Yes PM So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three PM Then you would make a four PM If you fill out a four Yeah we havent re uh re uh really worked it out but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find UI Thats not even But thats not possible to fill in so we have to round it ID But Im filling in a three ID Does it will so it will be a two point five ID Yes it is ID I have a veto ID Exactly ID Its not about the content its about okay um is it easy to f Yeah definitely ME Is it easy to find UI Yes UI It it most definitely is its very easy ID Yeah or beeps or yeah PM Yeah but thats the thats the the basic idea of the the speaker uh But even without it Yeah UI Yes UI Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that ID Im here Im here UI Maybe you have to uh programme it once so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence something like where are you and then it will sing Im here ID Yeah ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So something like that UI So I th Yeah me too ID Well I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time but I personally give it a one ID Um Sebastian PM Me too ME Yeah I agree ID Right well ID The feel of the remote control is spongy ID Well uh it cant be more spongy ID So No okay but but for the options given its the most spongy one UI Well it can be UI There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable PM Was it one of our options UI No its not one of our option but when you look in the market when you look Uh yes but thats not thats not uh what they are talking about I think ME No ME Uh this this was a most spongy option PM So in the in Yeah UI Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market ID Yeah UI So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy ID Yeah UI Theyre out there ID Theyre out there PM But I think in this case in this case weve done the best we could UI Yes but its not good enough so its a two ID Yeah ID Ill give it a one PM I wan Ill take one UI You take one UI What do you give it ME Well yeah it depends cause its the most spongy we could but yeah ID Yeah I know but you have to name a fig uh a number ID Because we need to go on in for the time ME Well if I give it a one therell be one hell of a calculation PM It will be a one ME So Ill just give it a two and make this a one point five UI No no no UI Uh Ill Ill change it Ill make it m my my mark will be a four ID You are okay ID The remote control offers enough features ID Well Ruud what what do you think about it ME Well the basic layout doesnt offem offer much but the voice recognition could add a lot ME So Yeah depends UI Basically its its completely programmable ID Yeah UI You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode ID Yeah I know UI So its quite advanced ID What what we didnt talk about is um uh I think it has PM Yeah but it ha doesnt has the digits PM I believe its If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features I dont I dont think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has ME Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Signal ID Yeah ID Bec because you can um we didnt talk about it but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal UI Yes ID So you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three whatever and it r records the uh the um the the signals UI Has uh the signals sent to it PM Yeah ID So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like as long its able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal ID So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features UI Absolutely ID Although there are i a few buttons but the inside is is quite uh advanced UI Yes UI But that thats its power I guess because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains well uh really a lot of buttons ID Yeah UI At at least uh forty buttons ID Yeah UI So its its quite s complicated to get uh to get used to UI And this is quite s simple UI You can use your voice to to programme it ID Yep UI Its Yeah Ill give it a one ID Yeah ID Okay um lets give it a number ID Ill give it uh a one ID For for the for this t uh type of market I think its a one PM Ill give a two ME Um I think think a one cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want so thats like um Maybe even because it doesnt look advanced UI Yes UI I Ive I think weve uh succe succeed in in developing a product thats actually quite good but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price UI So Hmm ID Yeah ID So high quality low acceptance ID The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced UI Yes ID But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well is not sure UI Mmhmm UI Mmhmm ID D do you agree UI Yes I agree UI I Yeah okay ID Yeah ID Maybe we should have a radar uh function UI But Yes PM But we could couldnt uh what whats the selling price PM Fifty ID Twenty five Euros PM Uh twenty five PM And costs were twelve fifty ID Yeah PM But even now if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double Think PM Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ID Mmhmm PM So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah UI M about fifty Euros UI Thats quite ex well its not its not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality PM Thats price but w w No PM An original remote control of any TV kind uh a Phillips remote control y you pay uh Yeah I kn I know uh from a few years ago it it it costed hundred Gilders UI Yes its more than fifty Euros UI Its quite expensive yes ID Bu but well yeah I know but youre paying for th for the brand because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo television DVD CD player for under twenty five Euros UI Yes UI Yes but you can you c Yes but you can learn this thing all these functions UI And its easier to use because those uh remote controls dont offer voice recognition and this one does ID Yeah ID Yeah UI So I think its worth its price ID Okay ID Um you had an overall rating ID Um Thats counting ME Yeah but uh with these ratings uh should be about one point s seven yeah UI Well its its about one point five PM Four six seven eight UI Something like that ID Okay PM Nine divided by six ID Okay ID Um well go further on with the the rest of the evaluation ID About the project itself not about the product ID Um What did you think about uh the process the project process ID Ruud ID Try to translate that UI Well Well I think Mm PM Hmm ID Any any other Uh Roo PM Yeah I think uh The process was good ME Ye The prices ID Roo PM But w um we werent aware of the prices of the costs ID Yeah PM And and that was the the big deal PM I if we knew that before we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah UI Actually we had Yes ID Better decision UI We had we had too little information actually ID Yeah UI So And uh um the the the well looking at room for creativity there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow ID Less UI So there was not really a process of uh Well Yes ID Yeah ID So we could we we could be we couldve been creative ID But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price UI Well in the first meeting we we already were very creative UI We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components ID Yeah UI So Were tempered by that yes ID Yeah ID Okay Roo ID Any other thoughts on that PM No no ID Ruud ME I agree ID You agree okay ID Uh leadership PM Fantastic ID Okay Roos on for his promotion UI Yeah okay ID Okay UI I think were a good team ID I think so too its its its uh of course a laboratory environment ID I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh hey Roo uh UI Yes PM Yeah ID Um Yeah UI Well I tried once but that was not allowed ID So um Yeah but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation uh I think we performed pretty well UI I think so too PM Yeah ID Yeah ID Um the means the SMARTboard the digital pen ID Did you like em UI Uh UI The digital pen was okay but SMARTboard was really bad PM Yeah UI It its The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited ID Because of the response or Okay PM Response and Uh it it has yeah UI Its not accurate ID Uh Okay so it it had to be um better aligned or whats the word PM Yeah its not accurate PM The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh Yeah where it draws ME Draws PM Its uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen PM So uh You to take in account that your you m yeah uh Its too slow Hmm ID Uh yeah UI Maybe its it needs to be calibrateds ID It it was calibrated just before this meeting ID Uh the one before the third meeting UI It is UI Okay ID So uh its not the calibration its the thing itself I think UI Okay ID Uh Ruud w uh did you use the pen a lot ID Or not at all ME No ID Not at all ME Not really ID Okay ID I thought it was quite a handy uh thing although I would like to see um OCR UI I I think so too UI Yes PM Yep UI Yes PM If it has OCR uh I think uh I would use but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and thats it ID Yeah PM It w it w yeah PM It was necessary for me to uh Yeah because if I want something on the computer I just type it ID To digitise them ID Yeah UI Mmhmm PM I type faster than I write PM So Economic ID Yeah UI But I think its a great solution for uh for uh a known problem uh writing down some notes some some inf uh information and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information ID Yeah UI Because you have everything in one place and its quite easy quite easy its its possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way ID Yeah UI I think its a good product UI I only think its th the the shape of the pen is too big ID Yeah UI Its not quite uh ergonomic UI Eco ergonomic ID I know ID Yeah ID Okay ID Um What w Uh Ruud what did you think about the SMARTboards ME Oh I only use it to draw a rabbit so cant say much about it ID Yeah ID Okay you cant really decide ID No ID I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops ID I think that would be very easy if you could say okay I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or Or the other way around that you could show but m I know UI Yes ME No or the other way around PM Yeah UI Yes yes UI Thats quite what PowerPoint does PM But y you can if you save this image you can open it in your shared work folder ME Yeah ID I know but I know but we couldnt use that feature so I missed it PM So its almost yeah PM Yep ID We werent able to do that ID At least the um I wasnt explained how to do such a th Okay PM Mmhmm PM A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object UI An object yes UI Yes UI The drawing cap capabilities are very limited PM I its not possible yeah UI And and uh w you were when youre using uh Windows youre used to a certain interface and certain buttons uh which you can use for drawing ID Yeah UI And a lot of these buttons dont appear here UI So its Not not uh n not way PM Oh it looks like paint actually ID Okay so y it its not even as advanced as paint ID Yeah UI Its quite uh limited ID Okay ID Uh no ID Yeah the project is evaluated ID Um but well we need to redesign uh the product UI Okay UI Oh very good celebration ID Celebrate UI Pop uh pop up the champagne PM Great PM It was a privilege working with you ID Okay ID Um youre dismissed ID No I think we are uh ready UI Okay PM To private rooms UI I see some action over there ID Private room Roo ID That sounds quite scary UI Okay ID No lets find uh the way to UI uh were done were finished I believe UI So are there any more cycles in this process UI I think not ID I dont believe so ID Well maybe wed get an email ID Thank you for your Forty minutes UI But um how much time did we get for this meeting UI And how much time is left ID A minute or or ten maybe ID M Yeah ten or five UI Ten minutes UI Okay UI Okay ID So we can uh redesign our uh Uh I would like to Oh UI Well I think we we we all know what the redesign should be UI A simple dull uh onecoloured box ME And no added value UI No its its just the same product that is already on the market ME At all ME So In interesting design PM But you see the problem y you cant continue your uh your line ID Yeah PM Well its fluffy alright PM Spongy UI What is that PM A giraffe ID Yeah UI Its a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree ID Its blue tongue ID Yeah ID This is a new model ID But Blue tongue UI So youre actually promoting Bluetooth UI Or blue tongue ME Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling ME So Yeah ID Its spongy ID That is uh its a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices UI Blue tongue UI Okay ID Um Yeah were done here PM Right UI Lets wrap it up ID Gentlemen thank you for your cooperation UI Thank you Mister manager UI Now lets have uh a bottle of champagne PM Leave it here ID Yes PM Thats alright,"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised."
ID Okay good morning ID This is our first team meeting PM Good day ME Morning UI Morning ID Ill be your Project Manager for today for this project ID My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off ID Thats my uh thats the agenda for today ID Well of course were new to each other so Id like to get acquainted first ID So lets do that first I mean Lets start with you can you introduce yourself ID Youre our Marketing Expert ME Yes ME Um my name is Dirk Dirk Meinfeld ME Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert ME And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product ID Okay excellent ID And you are User Interface Yeah PM Nick Broer User Interface Designer PM Im going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view ID Excellent ID Okay UI My name is Xavier Juergens Im the Industrial Designer and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today UI First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus second is what is uh the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like ME Hmm ID What should it look like ID Okay ME Hmm ID Oh lets kick it off ID Oh there we go ID So our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set so which has to be original trendy and userfriendly ID I took this off our corporate website ID Its I think well it sums up what we need to do ID Were inspired by latest fashion not only electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design ID Thats why our product will always fit in your home ID So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to whats currently hot in the market ID So thats what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want ME Yeah ME Yeah ID So So we put the fashion in electronics ID So thats what we need to go for ID Anyway well take this project in three steps three pha uh three phase of design ID First step will be the functional design ME Yeah ID And thats basically what were gonna do ID Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards so we can share information about So Im gonna keep this short since we had a technical problem ID So skip through this ID Uh ID Okay ID Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything so to help with these you have we have the SMARTboards here ID We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation ID Im supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board so its actually its very easy ID Like it says very simple you just take out the pen ID Like you see here Ill just take the take here ID Thats it you just put it on the board ID You see a pen here ID You go here just like using a pen ID You can just draw whatever you want ID Its like the eraser can erase whatever you want ID And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views if you wanna change the format you just either take out jus just like the pen and whatever you want your current colour your line width just to make the line bigger ID So it should be really easy ME Okay ID This is to take the just take a new slide and back again ID Were just gonna keep using this board all the time so I think it will be its very clear for everyone I suppose ID So Ill take this out ID Okay ID Well use that later ID Anyway ID Yeah just just just stuff that you wanna share just put it in the in the project folder like I put my presentation now ID Ill put the the minutes of every meeting Ill put them there too so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever ID So next been here ID Well gonna give the electronic whiteboard uh a shot ID So basic idea is we have a blank sheet ID Just try whatever you want and like it says draw your favourite animal ID I think the creative genius should go first PM The creative genius PM Thank you very much ID So draw us your favourite animal PM Well Im more into the technical aspects of drawing so Im not really good at drawing animals but uh the animal which I Oh ID Draw us a technical animal ID Yeah its still erasing PM Pen PM Uh format PM Else my animal will be like kingsize PM I pretty much like a dolphin because of its uh its freedom basically PM Lets see PM A head PM actually worked with this PM Its like uh its a very Uh hightech PM Bit lowresponsive though PM Prefer pen and paper ID So thats what we dont want ID We want a highresponsive product ID So It looks more like nuclear bomb ME Very nice dolphin PM It doesnt look like a nuclear bomb PM This thing isnt doing what Im What I want PM So Yeah well it does look like a nuclear bomb ID Lets go easy on it PM Ill just finish up real soon because Im So it doesnt really look like a dolphin but then again this is all new for me ID Anyway it should It Its supposed to be a dolphin you like the freedom that it that it represents UI Uhhuh PM Like the ocean like swimming PM Do that in my spare time so thats basically an Now we can forget this ever happened ID What do you like ID Okay ID Well our Marketing Expert ID Show us an animal ME Um an animal ME I like the elephant ID Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet ID Oh ME What ID Take a clean sheet first ME Yeah ME Um Oh yeah ID Just press next ID Thats it ME Oh a blank ME Okay next ME Free I like the elephant ME Its big its strong so uh uh Oh its a little bit You have to hold it right PM Its not really that responsive no UI Mm ME Hmm ME Its a beautiful animal ME Oh you have to p press it pretty hard ME With a smile on it its very important ID Its a cute elephant ME Yeah ME And uh not to forget its tail ME Oh ID Its a nice beard ME Yeah its okay PM And you was making comments on my dolphin ME Yes ME I will beat the dolphin ME No ID Okay so its just a bee ME Yeah ID So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market ID The big and strong player in the market ME Yeah ID This would be good ME Yeah ID Okay excellent ID On to the next one UI Okay ME Uh yeah UI Okay you should press next ME Yeah ID Press next ID Yeah its up there UI Okay ID Thats it UI Okay well the animal Id like to draw is a tiger PM You picked a hard one didnt you ME Experience with the tiger UI My drawing skills are really bad so ME What ME They are Okay uhhuh UI They are really bad my drawing skills ID Sure looks smooth ME Oh UI Im not sure how the legs should go but Uh these are stripes PM Got it UI Ive picked this animal because its very fast UI It is uh it knows exactly what it wants UI Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources ID What does it want UI Uh well basically uh it hunts for prey but it does it always in a very wellthought way UI Uh it knows exactly what it wants UI It never kills an animal uh just for the killing so its very efficient UI And it tries to do everything as fast as possible ID Okay UI And it always goes for uh security in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything security speed and efficiency is important ME Mm UI And I think uh those things we can use ID I agree ME Okay ID Yay Im supposed to draw the animal next ID I introduce to the world the amazing ant ME Uh hard worker ID Great teamworkers ME Yeah UI Yeah ID Do everything to Uh really small but together theyre really strong ID So Im gonna give it a smiley face ME Yeah yeah UI Oh ID Not sure where the p ID Just put em here ID Whatever ID Think it need shoes ID So Im just too lazy to draw it all black so Thats the coolest ant ever PM Youve done this before havent you ID I love to draw ants ID Its my hobby ID Anyway Nah ID Just I think its very representative what we drew I guess ID Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us ME Yeah ID Just Yeah ID Youre supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have and just make it a little distinct ID Anyway ID another beep to stop the meeting ID See ID Warning ID Finish meeting now ID Uh put this down ID Examples ID Well I guess we have a little little time extra but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work ID So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short ID Ill start with you ID What are y What are your first ideas for the new product PM Well I basically had a question ID What The project I got was just for a TV remote control PM Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control PM Is it just the TV or do we want to in Just for TV remote control ME Uh Yeah ID Yeah I guess so PM Okay PM Well I was thinking about design remote control with our uh motto and all ME But Yeah PM Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with PM No rational changes or whatever cause it revolutionary changes yes ID Okay so very intuitive design I guess PM Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product PM So that was something I wanted to add and perhaps some usability aspect PM TV is becoming central in most homes PM Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh yeah to be able to use it as well ID Yeah we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it ID So I think I mean really disabled people yeah might be a problem but I think its a little take it into consideration ID Um yeah ID I think we really need to cut the meeting short ID You have anything you wanna share quickly UI Hmm ME Uh UI Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of it should be something light UI Thats it speaks for itself but some uh Yeah PM Yeah ID It should be light okay ME Yeah ID Um lets see where did I Lets skip that ID Oh this is it ID Sorry I skipped this sheet ME Selling price ID What do we This Quick What were going to Selling price twenty five Euros ID Thats for you ID The production price twelve and a half Euros approximately UI Okay ID Just go go for that ID Well reach the uh reach that profit UI Okay PM Okay well thats not that much to work with ME international ID No its not much to work on ID Im sorry I skipped it ID Anyways thats Yeah this is it ID Do you have anything you you came up with yet ID About uh marketing transfer whatever ME Um about what ME Marketing ID Marketing Im not sure what you what you came up with yet ID You have anything to share ID Or else well cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since were supposed to stop ME Um no not really yet but Ive some ideas and I will uh say it uh Okay ID Okay ID Anyways the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything ID So well just meet back in here thirty minutes UI Okay ID Im sure we have that UI Good luck everyone ID Yeah thanks for attending PM Mm good luck ID Ill see you back here in thirty minutes ME Okay ME Yes,"The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials. The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals. Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns."
ID Wait for the marketing director actually so ID Anyways ID Uh ID See shall we wait ID Im not sure if hes late or delayed or whatever so Im gonna start soon we have now dont have much time anyway PM Oh there he is ME Yes UI Okay we Mm ID There you are okay ME Sorry a little bit of pl little problem with computer ID Uh no problem ID Were about to start so have a seat ID Okay welcome again ID Today functional design phase ID Ill take you over the minutes of last last meeting ID Okay that was just to get to know each other have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project so I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share so if you wanna review them theyre there ME Uh ID I will do so after every meeting so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there ID Anyways um today three presentations from every one of you ID Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board so were gonna go af go after over this later ID But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first so we can see what everybody came up with ID And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts so ID Who would like wanna go first ME Yeah sure no problem PM Go ahead ID Take it ME Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh Yeah ID Anyway lets see what you have ME Um Okay and I want to open the my s oh no ID Uh its still a bit open ID You should close it on your own notebook I guess ID Yeah ME Oh no thats okay ID So there ID Okay ME Uh slide show ME Yes ME The functional requirements its uh uh very important for uh the user he he wants to yeah ME The the method we used uh it its not m not a slide because it went wrong but the method we use uh um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what whats uh important ID If I can cut in is it people or men ME Uh People sorry ID Is it people okay ME Both women and men yeah ID Cause I thought it was only men so Kay ME Okay ME Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly ME Um Yeah and yeah most th th they want to spend money for a better system for better remote control so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it and um they use yeah they use zap a lot um uh fifty percent say they only So thats the most important things PM Thats pretty shocking uh ID So we have to s we have to do something about that ID Okay ME Um oh yeah not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation but um uh the relevant buttons are the power the channel selection and the volume selection ID Okay just talk ahead ME Its uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use ID Mmhmm ME Uh less important is tel teletext uh um they use it but its not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection the the hmm ID Mmhmm ID Okay thats okay ID Thats a little weird ME Oh the the no no no no no thats very important but uh w and not important in the audio settings display settings and uh Yeah PM Which channel selection ID Okay we can we can hide those under a menu or something okay PM Oh okay ME Um new preferences preferences ME Uh um um beep to find your control was that was in the test the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control so uh I think its a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it ID Thats like a button on your TV ID Remote okay ME And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to lets go to channel one and uh thats uh kind of things ID Okay ME And they want maybe an uh LCD screen um to to look it um wh whats on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ID We wanna have a little preview on the remote control ME Yeah ID Preview whats on the channel ID Okay PM Is that manageable PM Cause it sounds pretty expensive too ID That sounds too Its possible but uh I think its expensive but do continue ME Yeah PM Okay ME Yeah ME Um Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel so I can uh I dunno so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel so I can zap t to What ID Okay you dont set it yourself it just remembers the channel that you are on most for example ID You want the you want it to be programmed for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Recognise Yeah ID Lets see you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel so it recognises your favourite channel ME Yeah thats uh what my personal preference like ID Okay so its it it does it recognise itself you dont have to set it Okay ME No itself ME Maybe its easier to to sell it but I dont know its manageable but we will uh we will see ID Okay ID I see ME Yeah its a little bit uh its the end of it ME Its a little bit uh I lost it the computer uh crashed so ID Okay PM Okay ID No problem its its okay thats Yeah go ahead PM Shall I go PM Okay ME Yeah PM So some technical functions ME Darn computer PM Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier ME Yeah PM Uh lets just start with the method PM It sounds really easy what does the user do what does the th remote control do but there are quite some issues PM So the things Im going to concentrate on are the user aspect because the technical aspect thats pretty much covered PM We can do that PM What goes wrong at the user PM Gets the remote control PM Where is the remote control PM Weve all had it once I want to watch some television wheres the remote control ME Yeah PM That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder a really good idea ME Yeah ID That seems very good PM Uh these are just the issues PM I come to some uh personal experience findings possible solutions later PM Searches for the button PM There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear PM Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear ME Mm uh ID Mmhmm PM Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while PM Theres nothing more annoying than faded symbols because you dont know which channel is this button so possibly we could find uh something for that yes ID Okay so have it more make it more durable actually ID Okay PM Uh covered that PM Oh yes user presses the button PM Um usually when you have a lot of buttons buttons are small PM So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control ID Okay so the buttons should be Mmhmm ID Yeah PM And possibly also the size so more important buttons bigger si So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fadeproof symbols locator a sound uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others ID Wow ID The s Yeah ID Make it make them bigger ID Even more durable uh ID Okay PM Uh This I pretty much covered PM So what we want to go to is not this one but more less buttons easy some bigger buttons ID Yeah its true ME Yeah PM So thats basically uh what I had in mind ID Yeah thats clear PM This is not the final design this is just a general idea of how Id like to see uh basically the general idea ID No of course uh Yeah ID I must say that it Hmm PM So that was it ID That was it ID Okay that was good ID So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing so The other aspects well just see how what you came up with and whats possible for that budget PM Yeah I think its a really good idea PM Yeah PM Yeah ID Okay UI Okay thats fine UI Um UI Okay now work a little with me UI Okay UI Well lets start it as it is UI Okay uh the method UI There are a few questions that need to be answered uh you already uh talked about it a little bit UI Which buttons are wanted uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable UI Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it UI Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do ID Mmhmm UI And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be UI Ill tell you why thats important to me UI Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control so uh uh thats why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already ID Mmhmm UI So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of it has to b to be built UI So its thats not as easy as it s might look like ID Yeah ID Of course hmm PM Okay UI Uh material study Im working on that um for the the costs UI I have to check out how far I can go with that UI Normally a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper UI Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way I think we can just go on with that UI Um then Ive read more integration of materials means less cost for the production UI The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece uh that is cheaper ID You mean integrate them all into the circuit board UI Exactly so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it then thats cheaper ID Okay ID Yeah okay UI So we have to make something thats not too difficult in design again ID So you have Mmhmm UI This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button so this is not the entire thing UI You have the the power coming in then you have like a switch UI The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor that thinks over a Morse code thats how you should see it UI The Morse code goes to the amplifier then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs UI You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it UI Uh a light in indication light that you know that its functioning UI Uh here again thats my story about the different modes if you do want to make remote uh universal then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed UI That makes it much more complex so we really need to have a look do we want that or not UI Uh I dont have any personal p uh preferences uh so far except for uh the materials to be used uh light that they are light ID Okay ID Okay ID That was it UI That was it ID Ill get back to my thing then ID Uh Okay back this up to the screen ID So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little ID Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet nowadays people dont use the teletext anymore or hardly so it can either Well I dont think we should remove the button because there are always people who are using it PM Yeah ID But I dont think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example ID Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever ID Its not important anymore ID Um were targeting young people now because our um This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people which are um the younger people were defined under forty ME Uh ME Yeah UI Hmm ID I so I think its thats also good with the fashion and everything so yeah ME B Yeah and they want to pay for it and uh With more Where with more technical specifications in the Yeah ID They want to pay for it people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like ID If they like the way it looks the way it functions so theyre actually gonna spend uh spend money on it ID Yeah ID see how far we can go with it anyway so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable which is apparently black and yellow but Im not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it which suits everybodys taste ID So With that concept I started thinking so why not just steal Nokias idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see PM Oh UI Yeah ID Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design ID And sell the covers separately for example ID Thats just a little marketing idea that could be applied so you can p it appeals to really everyone ID So you dont have to I think you dont have to make entire remote controls ID We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately UI Mmhmm ID So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone UI Hmm ID So just Im not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime after making a presentation ME Yeah ID Would you like to share UI No I think this is a good idea ID Okay UI But Go ahead ME But oh PM Is it manageable ME Yeah with with an LCD screen you can Why PM Is it easy ID Oh yeah ID I think we should lose the LCD screen like you said UI Y Yes I think so too PM Yeah ID I think for example its its huge I think the LCD is huge it consumes batteries like hell ME Nokia w Uh ID I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power UI Yeah PM And it costs too much to fabricate so were on a tight budget here ID It costs a lot I think UI Okay uh Mm ME Okay ID What we could do what could be possible is maybe not an LCD screen but with a preview but y Im not sure if its even possible ID For example a little TV guide UI Hmm ID Like you have a little just just a text only not colour just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a TV guide UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ID Im not sure its even possible but maybe okay make it Yeah find a little compromise in that but What did I write down UI Hmm UI I have to check that out Im not sure ME Yeah ID I think the p yeah the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement just make a button on your TV and just hit the button it beeps somewhere UI That must be possible ID I think its easy to implement we should go for that UI Ja UI Im sorry whe where do you wanna hit the T you wanna we want a button on the television PM And its Maybe just a slapon sticker with a button which sends out a small signal ID Uh speech recognition ID I thin Yeah I mean where else should you put it UI In th okay but that rules out a universal remote control UI Because thats not possible uh ID Yeah but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button UI Uh UI Yeah UI Exactly ID A slapon sticker ID Oh you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your TV ME Mm uh PM Yeah exactly ID Yeah that could be possible ID A little little box you can attach to your TV is fine then okay UI Okay then uh Id Id like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not because thats uh determines everything Im gonna do ID I think its universal ID I think we should go for universal because apparently were a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people UI If not Okay ME Yeah ID I think universal remote control should be possible ME Um Everyone uh wants to buy it so we w yeah UI Okay then I go for that ID Yeah I think were targeting everyone so remote Okay universal is good UI Yeah UI Okay UI No its fine with me but then I know what to look for ID Speech recognition I think its very hard because were selling across multiple countries ID So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus its very hard to do ME Yeah ME Or one ME Or when you say one two uh i it uh its enough right PM And its Besides that the technology isnt really super yet so that is a problem in implementing this ID Yeah but I dont see Arabian people speaking one two uh whatever ME But Oh yeah ID Its Yeah ME Yeah ID Its not a mature technology I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control so I dont think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh ME Okay PM Its a good idea but its just not I dont think the markets ripe for that yet UI Uhhuh ME Yeah ID What else do we have ID Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable UI Mmhmm ID So the the the symbols wont fade maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we dont maybe we dont have have to do all the buttons but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons so those always fade first UI Exactly UI I already noted that UI Mm okay UI Okay ID Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now UI Hmm ID Lets see UI If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers then we can also make uh a cover for every language area UI Thats fo is uh especially for older people that they can read it read it in their own language ID For example ID Well were not were not targeting older people we should remember that ME Yeah ID Everything we target is under forty so UI Thats okay okay ID You assume that that they read correctly and I think theyre The most important thing about young people is that theyre really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world so No of course UI Huh ME But b But every Oh UI Uh okay PM But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the C thats a problem with the with the text then ID No I think its just something you you put over them because Yeah we c Yeah you ca Well tha thats not a thats not a bad thats not even its not even a bad idea UI Hmm UI Hmm ID I mean for example if youre if youre into the durability issue you could For example if your buttons are faded after I mean if you make a durable remote they are faded you can just buy a new cover UI Mm ID Uh Im not sure its its hard to make UI Okay UI Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve so you dont have to change your whole cover ID So its a good and a bad idea ID Mmhmm UI Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve UI Know what I mean PM Oh yeah I know what you mean UI It works the same as a Nokia telephone its its in my uh kay ID Yeah I know its just just a one one piece of rubber for example okay ME Yeah UI Exactly PM Yeah ID Yeah thats what I something I have to look into ID Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover Im not sure which which is easier so Um anyway yeah this is what were gonna do afterwards just lunch break and have more individual work after that so lets see what we lets see we So you have to come up with a components concept yeah UI Hmm ID I want some you should do some trendwatching because even if were if were gonna do those covers and everything what people really want thats what we need to know in this phase because thats gonna be the essential final design that were gonna come up with ME Yeah ME Yeah ME Okay ID Um Yeah I think user interface is fairly obvious ID I mean it should be very intuitive s Yeah it should speak for itself PM Pretty straightforward ID Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new TV it was it l its like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first and Im total TV new anyway ID So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things ID Or maybe just stick em under a menu like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever theyre more complicated just stick em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your TV UI Mm PM Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu because were working with different types of television so were going to work with that UI Yeah ID That is true UI I dont think so ID No thats true UI No I dont think so UI Because the television needs to respond to the signal and if it doesnt know how its Exactly thats not possible ID Yeah thats true PM Its an inbuilt menu isnt it PM Yes PM So basically we Or we could use a doublesided for less used functions you Yeah with the cover ID Im not sure if its impossible but uh theres a chance its not so ID A doublesided remote control ID I dont think thats useful PM I its basically an idea to overcome these issues because No but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used ID Yeah but then youre gonna have a lot of wasted buttons ID For example you have a Sony TV and the half of the buttons wont function if you have a for a Sony that wont for a Philips TV UI Hmm ME Yeah PM Because if we use a universal remote control were going to have to have most buttons on it so Yeah ID I dont think we should Yeah for exam Im not s yeah for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their TVs not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing but you cant you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of TVs ME Mm yeah UI Mm UI Mm UI But that might be broken ID I think theres I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands UI Hmm UI Hmm ID Especially the big ones the big brands so UI Hmm ID Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button so I think Im not sure if you can put some research into that if its possible UI Hmm ID Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic its usually the same thing UI Mm okay UI Mm UI But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television UI For instance if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television thats in it ID Yeah ID Yeah thats true ME Yeah UI Because otherwise youll lose functions by buying our Okay I thi I think so too ID I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu I think its possible just the way how to ME Yeah ME Yeah yeah ID Yeah then then you could do everything I suppose because usually the TVs have tha that inside in this other little piece of software so its okay UI And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other UI For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same only the labels are different ID Mmhmm ID Yeah ID Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else because its either its both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different UI We should not do that UI Exactly ME Yeah PM Yeah I have some ideas PM I have some ideas ID Maybe its a little more curves or whatever ME Um yeah UI Mm thats your uh division ME And uh with different colours uh ID So um Yeah this PM Ill put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have ID Not sure what because we have forty minutes Im not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway so ME Okay PM I heard a beep go ID Yeah but it wasnt me it was him closing something ME Yeah ID So anyway yeah we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example ID I mean what do you want do you want but Yeah may maybe something like this PM Yeah but we like some some curves or Yeah ID But though smooth inside ID So you have the transmitter here for example ID Lets see that you what would be handy ME Uh ID I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own ME And a light uh Volume ID Lets see one two God damn it PM Oh we get the general ideas yes ID Yeah okay ID Another one here ID Lets see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control so they should be here UI Hmm PM Yeah and since youre holding it like this I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah ID Think its like this ID Withi within the Yeah just take it PM So you have the up channel the down channel the volume do we want that horizontal or vertical ID Do you take triangles or Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make em bigger or whatever ME Uh its its fine I think PM This is basically what people are accustomed to so Yeah but this is just a g general idea UI Yeah ME Oh d Yeah ID Yeah PM Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle ID Yeah in the middle ID Its its usually uh there but Mm PM Whoa UI Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it if you if its lost for people that are deaf UI They they wont hear the the beep ID Yeah but for example if its lost in your armchair well not see the flash PM You wont be able to find it UI Yeah ID And flash takes up a lot of batteries again UI Uh UI Yeah its true but its its only has to do so when you press the button that its lost ME Just And LED uh on it ID Yeah PM We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up UI So UI deaf people ID Yeah I thought about for deaf people for example so ID We could do that ME Just a light on it or Very important ID Uh lets see PM So we have the basic channels weve got here uh the power button somewhere over here ID Oh yeah its true ID Um that thing should be central ID You shouldnt be you uh shouldnt press it by accident but it shouldnt be stacked away somewhere ME Oh thats Its And But you r And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it PM I usually press it on top PM At least thats what Im accustomed to ID Yeah UI I have another idea Im not sure if its possible ID Yeah like thats gonna work PM What would you like to ID Yeah I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to From top to bottom ID Yeah thats true you should I think the bu the power button should be on top cause its the first thing you do turn it on ME Yeah so its Yeah UI Mm ID So power button on top ID Um Mute PM Okay mute button PM Is that somewhere here ID Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere PM Is that used often ME So i its sorry PM The mute button ID Mute PM Do people use that often ID Turn the sound off ME No its no PM Cause uh Im pretty much accustomed to it right over here at least in general but Its not that important no ME Uh ME Hmm ID I dont think its important but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here ME Or or with the volume selection ID No because it Yeah people are accustomed to that its Can I have that ME Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection ME I dont know where exactly but Wha No PM Sure ID Thats j Take this out and here see Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ID Im drawing triangles but Yeah its maybe a bigger lesser than thing PM Thats pretty much what people are accustomed to arent they ID So anyway I think this is should be the channels and or sh Here okay PM Well Im accustomed to the channels being on top ME Yeah UI Yeah me too ME Yeah thats better ID Okay should we chan okay this two channel up and down ME On the right UI Shall we uh also look if its possible to make a rechargeable remote UI That you dont have to buy new batteries if every Mm yeah ME Yeah ID Well for that is its on one part its um its a good thing to recharge it Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example ME Maybe its more ex expensive UI Uh ID You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable because its an its its its very annoying UI But thats already possible PM But isnt that expensive in the entire package ME Yeah ID Im not sure y Im not sure its if its expensive but just take a look at it because it might be a very good idea ID Because if its its uh useful to have it rechargeable but at the same time if you dont want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch TV now you wanna be able to put different batteries in it use it now and not in half an hour UI Yes UI Yes UI Okay UI Uh you could make a device but Im not sure how that uh is possible with the costs that you can put in normal batteries rechargeable but it youre the remote also can act as a recharger ID How about I think I have a nice idea UI So then you can choose you have every decision UI Know what I mean ID Not exactly uh UI You can uh put in normal Penlites rechargeable Penlites but they can also be recharged with the remote with a wire ME Hmm ME Yeah yeah ID I think its uh its a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the TV UI So but But I think that will cost a lot ME Yeah thats g But Which Yeah ID Could be flat you could insert your uh remote into it UI Uh a normal wire would be better ID Im not sure UI Like a like a PDA a handheld ID A what UI You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself you dont need basic station ID Well we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a TV for example UI Yes UI That is possible thats true ID It could be very flat could be very small ID Its a very small Yeah Im drawing it big now but So you can put your remote on flat for example UI Mm ID And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down it recharges for example UI Yeah UI Yeah ID I dont think its very expensive PM But again isnt that too expensive ME Yeah PM Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries a docking station And do people actually want that ID Im not sure if it costs a lot that thats what he r Thats that you thats what you buy yourself UI Mm UI Yes UI Im going to try to find that out UI Im not sure if theres information available on this but Hmm ID Its just an idea we have to find out if its possible ME But Yeah they want to pay for it PM To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ID Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ME Yeah ID Im not sure you should find out if its if rechargeable is important ME Th uh there was not a el ask esque But But f hmm ID Yeah UI These are uh comfort issues UI So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort UI Well this is comfort ID They want to pay for comfort we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it um and Yeah we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station UI Yes UI Hmm UI Yeah UI Exactly UI I think this is a brilliant product UI I would buy it myself ID I think it would be good actually ID I like the beep part anyway UI Uh ID So um lets go through the Covers is covers is good UI I like the covers UI Thats a brilliant idea PM Can can we save this or Yeah UI I never thought I hope if I have information about that Im gonna Mm ID Yeah its Oh we can save this ID Up and saved ID We even saved the ant ID Um Okay ID So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if its possible for the cost ID Maybe yeah or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay ME Yeah ID We are going for twenty five Euros sales price but just try to find out what theyre willing to pay for it because if theyre willing to pay more we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers uh we just have to see what it looks like ME Yeah okay ME Yeah yeah yeah UI Yeah ME Yeah UI I would like to make a decision UI What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly I need it ID Yeah if you have some financial information that thatd be nice so ID Hmm PM Could you post some other essentials of what people want so that I can work with some buttons where to put it You seem to have information on that Id like to uh see some of it ME Yeah UI Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ID No it wasnt wasnt allo it was possible not allowed so PM No its not UI Not PM No ID So thats um why Im not sure that youre allowed to share documents on the on the draft ME Yeah ME My computer crashed so uh I lost my uh presentation but I have the uh Yeah but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet and here is my here is my marketing report maybe you ca you can look at uh that and Ah yeah UI Yeah okay ID I dont care ID I havent heard any complaints yet so PM Oh your computer PM Okay ID Um Yeah the oh they inc uh they include the new one PM Well I have your PowerPoint presentation I can get some inf information out of that PM Lets see ID Or just for you PM Oh where would we Where would we want the uh teletext button ID Oh no I didnt have that PM Because we decided that its n not that important ME And one And uh wha what people want Ive uh I have another thing uh Yeah ID All it tells just lets make make a new tick the new one PM Do we put it somewhere over here ID Um other side ID Yeah lets increase it a little because Yeah draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big so the more less important More or less PM Or maybe this is something for the next meeting I can draw out some ideas PM Yeah PM Well we have decided more or less the basic structure PM I can put the other buttons in Yeah ID Just play a little with this put l shift a little up or down and well see what looks best UI What uh what did you wanna say ID Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share ME Um Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost but it its also for people they want to learn it fast not uh they want to No Its yeah its easy to learn wi and uh Um And The If Um If um Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty PM Yeah PM Maybe another idea uh UI Mm UI Mm ID Yeah so we dont want we want very little buttons just the buttons you use a lot UI Mm PM Yes but it should cover all the functions so possibly just an idea that popped in Yeah but we could go a step further because some TVs have the uh possibility to adjust brightness that kind of menus ID Well what we had function that what people do so ID People change channels people they change the volume and they they change channel they turn TV off and on for example ID Thats the basic fu thats what you do Im not sure who present that again but those are the basic function that people use it for so those should be very well represented ID Thats true but thats what we stick under the menu button ID Everything is you say in every TV thats configured under the menu PM Yes but it Because were making We need to adjust to the technology UI But thats the question is it UI Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu ID Yeah but But I think most modern TVs have it in their menu UI If it isnt then we cannot reach it UI I think so too UI I think so too PM True UI Uh isnt there a possibility to do research on that so we know that for sure UI If you rule out functions then uh and that gets known then people are not gonna buy it UI Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it PM No I thi Oh were not going to be able to sell it for twentyfive then with an LCD screen UI Thats a bad bad com commercial for okay ID Uh well well see what we can come up with ID Under forty ID Yeah UI Thats true ME Um on my report I didnt uh ish I didnt show it in my uh presentation because my computer crashed ID Mmhmm ID Yeah yeah ME Um they want to pay for an LCD screen and speech recognition UI Hmm UI Hmm ID The want to pay for Oh ME So i yeah UI Did they really said it like that UI Those two things ME Yeah and Yeah UI Do they realise how much that costs ID Uh shall we UI Thats almost undoable ID Younger age sixteen and forty five ME Uh but If if they So uh we can We can look at the possibilities for an uh LCD and uh I dunno ID Thats all here here it says Yeah age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical UI No thats thats UI Even if i if we have this lost unit then we cannot do it for that price ID Okay so were not focusing on this ID Um All the interest in features not really the LC oh here ID Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control ID Hmm okay UI Yeah thats true ID Speech recognition is quite Yeah just look at the possibilities then because if apparently its what people want its supposed to be a luxurious remote maybe its not even that expensive UI Mm ME Yeah UI Hmm ME How much it will cost and Um It will come uh Yeah UI Uh ID Or find a compromise maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it on your programmes UI Uh I But I really need finance information PM Well I doubt it but Well I had basically Something like this ID Me too ID I mean we all do UI We all do ID Right ID I think its something we should put into consideration ID Apparently its what people want so UI Mm ID We should see if what it costs if its possible UI Uh ID Yeah ID Yeah we should do a little thing about design because it looks boring really to me ID Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it it looks still looks boring so ME Different colours maybe UI Hmm UI And the design it should differ ME But all Okay UI This is Philips huh UI Philips has this ID I have no clue ID I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily UI Okay UI Hmm UI Uh PM To make it kind of futuristic UI Mm UI Oh I realise if we make it small then it needs to be a little thicker because I need to put all the electronics in it ID I think its a very Sorry UI If we make it s uh smaller uh less wide then we need to m make it a little thicker because I have to put all the electronics in it ID Yeah ID Okay ID Mmhmm ID Yeah but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldnt be too heavy ID I mean we can stick it in in there I think UI No ID Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back PM So what kind of Yeah sure ID So lets say that people would want an LCD thing ID Lets take take the basic design again what we oh crap uh came up with ID Ill just make it a little bigger now ID So a transmitter here ID Anyway ID We could lets say we have an LCD screen people want an LCD screen ID So then we should probably put it here ID It doesnt have to be really big but just just have to be has to be there UI Hmm ID Think its a good place people dont No ME If youre reading from top to bottom I think its better to put it uh at the top ID Its not that uh its not the most important function its just an extra thing it just you press the buttons on top because your finger is on top UI Me too ME Its j Uh UI Ah but ME But i if you if you are going to uh put the LCD on it I think its very important to use it uh because its use it uh But nee the function of it ID How can you use an LCD screen ME So you can use it maximum because uh its a lot it costs a lot ME So Yeah ID Yeah but why I Im not sure PM Now its pretty much tucked away in your hand ID Uh if you t if you press a button you can see it ri Im not sure wha Im trying to imagine myself what it would look like UI Hmm UI No UI M I personally would prefer it on the top PM Im Im still not convinced of the Yeah ID You would prefer it n Okay UI Huh ID So we have three people saying it should be on top ID Okay but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else UI But it Hmm ID Anyways ME Its expensive to build it so you must use the maximum of it UI Mm ID Uh this looks a little About the LCDs thing UI Hmm ID Well if it if its if its possible wi if its not too expensive we should include it because its its cool UI They want it uh UI We should just try to make that if its possible UI If it is possible we should really do it but we need that information ME Huh ME Uh UI Also keep in mind again the LCD screen is very flat but it needs transistors resistors I dont know what more and that needs space ME But uh Yeah I know uh UI So I have to look if thats possible UI But if we Hmm PM So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top ID Uh we have green now uh Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom PM Do we put the volume control and the channel control here or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ME In middle of it ME In the middle ID Maybe in a circle for example like we like in this example ID I think this is not good but for we could make circular buttons for example ID For up and down ma make it a circle on it because it I think the channel button should be in the centre PM Yes but we do agree that we keep this at the centre because its basically the most important function ME Yeah ME Its the most import yeah ID Channel button should be st stick together for example here in this section ID Because its uh Were not sure about the size anyway just a general design PM Well that would make them quite small PM So maybe youd put them here ID You can make it as big as you want ID For example if you take uh No lets see PM Yes but a big remote control probably not something which people would like UI Hmm ID For example just Yeah UI If we have a a space issue we can also lose one battery UI It is rechargeable so we can stick with one instead of two UI That might be an option ID I dont think if we if we even use an LCD screen we need to definitely UI Yeah but if we need two batteries and an LCD screen that means a lot of space that we need ID Yeah but we have to see what the si what the size is UI But it has to be a little bit heavier UI Okay ID The LCD doesnt have to nee doesnt need to be very big UI No but the things behind it UI space ID Mm lets see UI Like a process uh ME Finish meeting now ME Its on your computer ID Finish meeting now ID Okay we will PM So would we like this or would we like the Lets see what we have here ID So either We either we have to decide what what people want UI I like this one more ID Either this one this this could be the luxurious one ID So we have channel buttons here ID Im just drawing something uh ID Uh I think this would this would look cool ID You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions so if your basic functions here we should like we decided before programmes up and down and volume here ME Uh UI Mm ME Or And uh what about speech recognition uh Yeah yeah but or or an LCD or an uh speech ID Well you can just no Im not sure if we can do that but we could put a microphone in here for example UI Mm ME I think its LCD is better now ID Just to do research into both w what it costs and what it takes for space ME Yeah UI Ill try to ME Yeah ID But lets cut the meeting for now yes UI One more uh thing Id like to say uh lets give this uh a name and not like some vague serial number that no one understands like with cars PM Okay ME Yeah okay yeah thats yeah thats okay UI Shall we all try uh to think about a name PM So I think of a name ID Yeah lets think of a name okay ID Uh okay ME Oh good ID Okay at anyways the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly so there we go uh PM So Yes go and finish up and Ill see you at lunch ME Yeah UI Good luck ID Yeah to all ME Same PM Yeah UI Yeah Ive Do we uh save the,"Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. On the other hand, materials should be more durable. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting."
ID Can I close this PM Uh we dont have any changes do we PM So no ID Oh okay ID There we go ID Okay here we are again ID Detailed design oh come on ID Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes but its about the same thing we discussed before ID Uh Could open that anyway think ID Other design anyway we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time ID We also that youre just busy with it ID Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features ID Well we discussed the design no sharp corners we rounded it off like you see on the other screen which is fine ID Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black ID Yellow in the back because its m trendy more trendy than black anyway ID So then we ca yeah ID We agreed that we would implement both the LCD and speech recognition but Ill get to that in a moment ID Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway ID So so like I said we had no insight in finances no prices but we have em now and its bad ME Hmm ID Anyway ID We are Oh ID Prototype presentation well first you guys built the prototype ID So you could could present that ID But um lets see what be handy to do ID Nee no you just go ahead and present the w well scrap it later because What UI I think its more or less the same as we had PM Its basically what we agreed upon but just a little bit more specified ME Hmm ID Oh thats hasnt changed that much huh UI No much s No no no not at all ID I didnt expect anyway ID You just coloured it PM Uh s Final design PM Basically in what we discussed cover and buttons will be made of rubber yellow colour black components as you can see right over here ID Mmhmm PM We chose a different type of colour for the menu ID I like the menu PM A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad ID Mmhmm PM If you put them all black its not really that good a contrast PM So Probab Yeah ID And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber ID Its its part of the rubber I suppose ID I think thats more I think thats more durable anyway than printed on to Oh yeah PM Thats the be And it I guess its more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh So we have its a bit round shaped thats what we had uh We chose the buttons to be uh teletext okay button favourite channel and the mute UI Hmm UI Yeah of course ME Mm yeah UI Thats uh the integration story again ME Okay ID Mmhmm PM So thats basically what we chose there ID Okay PM If you have anything to add please interrupt me UI No uh this is just a description of what we see there UI So Speaks for itself ID Yeah ME Yeah PM Oh PM Thats pretty much it ID Okay ID Now its my time to ruin everything ID Well not ruin everything but no nah PM Oh sorry ID Finances thats what we have here what you drew ID We have battery power we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor ID The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway ID So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts ID So well we have sin one curve a design ID Rubber design ID And we had a special colour ID Suppose yellow is a special colour ID So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an LCD display ID You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use UI Hmm ID So easy ME Hmm ID What do we scrap ID Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition UI I d Yeah PM Id say that too ID Because the LCD has more support on customer side UI Hmm ID There are ninety one percent of uh the people or something like that ID But ninety percent who favour an LCD display and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition ID I think its also harder to PM Uh we dont really have a extra function with the speech sample which you cant do with a normal remote control which people already do ME Yeah UI Hmm PM So Well Id I tend to disagree with you on that because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this ID So I ju I took that out ID So and so its still stuck with thirteen so I had to take out the special colour I suppose ID And yeah I didnt see anything else I could take out ID Yeah I could take out the pushbuttons but we need those ME Pushbut Special colour yeah UI Huh ID So generally what I came up with in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it well just then well do it in black ID Well just deliver it in black have the it has all the function that its supposed to have and if you want it if you want the custom design then you can buy the separate covers ID You make it d orange or whatever you want ID It was a big issue but Ill just go back PM So cant we just basically extend it to thirteen ID Uh lets just lets see what okay lets just see what we no we we have to be under twelve and a half ME Yeah it The p And the p What ID It its not uh the project is a nogo if we go over twelve and a half so UI Okay but theres another problem PM Okay UI But theres another problem UI If we take another cover for instance black then we also need another button frame cause black and black doesnt work obviously ID I think you thats what you were ass assigned to do really to to see how b th both those work together UI Huh UI Huh UI Yeah ID So I think yeah its I think its y one of the its a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too UI Hmm UI Hmm ID Just keep you just make new covers for the for it like we agreed before UI Right UI I agree ID And everything thats left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have ID Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip ID But we need that for the LCD display PM Yeah UI Mmhmm PM We do ID Then again we have the LCD display which is also expensive ID B yeah but those go together ID And yeah we could take out the curve UI Or say lets lose rubber take plastic PM We could take out a curve indeed ID Could we could take out the curve ID Is that an option UI Yes ID For you UI Although we are demolishing a little bit the style ME But uh the and Yeah PM I think the colour is more important than the really the curve because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control So black and grey is okay UI But Yeah ID Yeah ID I think its it it does ruin it but the fact that I t took that decision or t Took this example actually not really decision but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers ME The people Spongy yeah ID So you can change any colour you want ID So its just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want UI Can we then not also uh change the material UI We take plastic for the basic cover and We can put those to the to the other covers ID You can take plastic but I d its something thats stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls because theyre all plastic ME Yeah ME And But But The people want to pay for for it so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half UI Thats true ID So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesnt break UI But okay UI But what do you then suggest wed lose UI Because we have to lose two things and I guess ID I al like I said I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour which would make this black a black and grey UI Yes UI Okay and thats enough ID Yeah thats that that thats enough because I guess those are the basic colours ID So Oh UI Hmm PM Which we can fabricate okay ID I think those are basic col They want to To ensure the profit ID That thats th thats the order ID Were just uh were the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we dont wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this ME Yeah ME But we can take a risk ID But thats not for our thats not our decision to take PM No we basically We need to stick to that ID We have a budget of twelve fifty per product ME Okay yeah UI Hmm ID So Stick that ID I dont think its really bad either ID I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have I think they would do ME I hope the people will like it but Yeah ID Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want ID So I think its the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget UI Perhaps we should make m Huh ME Yeah ME The first sheet ID So Well I dont think Yeah UI Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost UI And thats uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost that they know that UI Perhaps they decide tha Of course ID Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer PM But they dont Well And if we So which curve is that ba thats basically that curve ID Like it like we dont care we dont care that you had to True but we did we didnt get that UI Perhaps they uh no but perhaps they think uh okay the cover is such a nice idea uh lets that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs UI We ca we uh we can at least tell them that You dont know that ID So I think its it should either be a pack maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something UI Huh UI No Im not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this ID But They could but uh Its an option but yeah its true UI We could at least m uh make it like this like you said and then tell them okay we had to drop this and that just that you know UI It is an still an option but not for this price ID So actually uh its not that much of an increase but yeah ID We cannot contact them ID Its just the order that we got UI Exactly but Hmm ME Yeah ID So thats what we gotta go with ID So its either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final its either turned into plastic drop the squishy feel make it make it more breakable um or turn it yellow ME Yeah ID So Its uh something we have to decide on UI Id say lose the curve and the colour and Hmm ID I say lose the curve ID Oh thats true we could lose the c yeah I forgot that sorry ID Uh the curve ID So Thats just this one just d this is the banana curve ME Yeah thats better ID So this would this would be straight PM So we could u still have the comfort ID No uh no that would be a curve inside the thing I guess ID No would ju then it would just be a straight remote ID Just like like that UI Hmm ID Which would yeah turn it into something far more ordinary ID we could make it yellow then but You second that you second that we lose the curve PM I second that PM No that it would turn out to be a pretty straightforward remote control ID Okay yeah PM So thats not really that I would Yeah ME Yeah ME Yeah ID So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world so to speak UI Hmm ID So we keep the curve ID So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber ID And Im in favour of keeping the rubber because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has UI Oh UI I agree PM I would say I would agree with you on the colour because thats an extra option an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money UI No ME Yep ID Mmhmm PM So we can always do that ID Yeah um I guess people are willing to pay for that ID So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control ME Yeah UI Hmm ID So I think that would still make it a nice product UI Yes ID Okay were final on that ID So its too bad we cant make the whole super thing ID But anyways were here ID Um yeah PM Which is basically what we discussed ID This we discussed just now ID Thats just now just we could just discuss how the project went ID I mean was kind of I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way but because you yeah everything cannot be for free ME And I want to do that ID We didnt I think it was too bad we didnt have the financial info the last time ID Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost PM Yes we could have Well I hope it sells UI Huh UI Hmm ID So we just put something I think its really nor not in stroke with reality actually ME Yeah ID So Yeah UI Me too I felt a bit blind throughout the project because in the beginning I had no list of available materials and then I d had not list of available c finances ID Yeah I think would have been ME Yeah ME But Lets um see um Um Lets Uh Oh ID Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that UI So Hmm ID So I suppose Yeah lets see if it sells ID I mean I suppose this sells because its very very extended ID But I suppose it sells because its good ID I mean its got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didnt know what its gonna cost anyway UI Hmm ME Hmm ME Okay lets eval evaluate uh the product of us our design ME Um I have some uh a method a requirements and scale of ME I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if its true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not ID Okay ID Have been met okay ME And I will uh make a new blank sheet ID Yeah ME So so the buttons the look and feel ME I thought it was okay but the advanced uh settings um screen audio and channel We are not Oh the menu button is it PM Which are basically accessible through the menu button ID Theyre stuck under menu ID For the menu UI Hmm ID I think those are totally met because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want they have the simplicity they want PM Yeah ME Hi Oh okay ME Then its all uh S its true ID I think its very uh very well met ID Either two or one maybe UI One ID I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration ME Yeah ID So it could either be a two or a one ME So d Oh wait ID One and a half ME Uh pen PM Which is not an option ME The p Oh yeah its red okay but Look and feel is everybo its true ID Just create our own option ID Yeah ME So Anyone ME And the next one uh yeah when its lost uh you can find it ID Its perfect ID Even for deaf people yeah ME Its Yeah UI Hmm ID Its I dont think its perfect but we did everything possible to to get it back PM To make it that way yeah ID Because if its stuck in you couch you can see the light ID Maybe you can hear it ID But I mean we tried so I think it thats that deserves a one ME And its and its yeah ID Definitely ME To ME Thats okay then ME And the next one ME How is that ME Uh w we had we dont have an uh manual yeah UI Manual ME But I think thats a part of it UI I think the LCD display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control but then again its for young people ME But Yeah an LCD it tells a lot about uh Yeah ID Id use an remote control PM Mm yeah UI So Yeah I th Exactly PM And its pretty straightforward you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the LCD menus ID Its pretty straightforward uhhuh UI No thats true UI I think it wont be a big problem PM So One I d no actu No it it is pretty straightforward ME So its a one or a I dont know ID I think but we didnt even there was no issue on making a manual actually ME For the advanced uh settings ID We didnt really discuss it but I dont think it takes no it really does doesnt take time to learn I think ME No okay that uh thats true ID We took it s its so easy we have so little button everything speaks for itself really ME Oh so it Takes no ti Yeah ID So I think thats yeah we didnt its either two or one I guess UI Ah UI Um With the more important functions on ID Maybe its a two because d uh the LCD is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button ID So I might make this a two instead of a one I guess PM Yeah PM Yeah ME And the LCD you have to see it ID So just make that a two ME Um mm Oh its a little bit learning ME Okay ME Uh yeah its uh a little bit same ME But it tells you or not UI Mmhmm ID You can use the LCD in a good way ID I think so ID I think its perfect the w where it is what it can do if it useful ID I think so ME But wha w oh yeah UI Mmhmm ME What are we uh displaying on the LCD screen ME Just uh only the channels and or What uh UI the menus uh Things like brightness and uh those kind of things weve put in the menu because we have no buttons for those PM Well basically the menu options indeed PM But No ME Oh in the LCD screen ID No y I mean in the LCD screen the small screen UI Yes ID What does it display ME And for a channel selection uh or thats not Yeah I thought I thought too but yeah ID Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their Im not sure if that even possible but cause its this requires a quite quite a bit of bandwidth ID I dont think its possible really ID But the they didnt really define in what should be used for ME But Maybe a TV guide or something in your LCD uh Yeah ID But I think in for example like TV guides I think thats that th that you can transmit through it and everything UI Mm ID Just for extra information on your programmes ME Yeah it must be clear then what what what for we use it ID But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example how do you configure that PM Yeah ME Yeah ID So that could be done by LCD display ID I think its good ID No maybe its not a one because its were not using it perfectly ID We didnt give it I dont thing overdiscussing ID Now we gave it enough thought though ME Yeah ID I think we d should just lower this ID Maybe maybe its a three though ID We couldve used it more effectively probably ME Yeah indeed ME So everybodys agree with an uh three on it its W Yeah UI Yes PM Yeah ID Yeah we are using it but its not its not poorly used but its not efficiently used I think PM Two or three PM So You can seven ID We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via LCD selection ME Yeah ID Its now its just extra to illustrate im uh extra features but okay ME Yeah I A three UI Nah its not really only an extra ME Ah nothing thats A seven UI No menus UI Think about Hmm ME Uh thats uh Yeah ID Can you talk to remote control PM Or we could say it Or we could say neutral we cause we scratched the C No we dont have the colour ID Well it cant talk anymore ID So we scrap that ID Oh yeah Just to be a prick but of course you can talk to your remote control it doesnt do anything ME Yeah yeah yeah yeah ID But you c you can talk to it ME Not with the speech recognition ME Uh yeah all the trends and no colours uh anymore ME So Yeah uh um only in the curves ID Well we did take everything into consideration of course ID Uh the shape i shape is i I think we yeah I think thats okay ME But the colours we dont have special colours on it ID Yeah special co but we took into consideration the fact that its customisable to the fashi We dont have it we do have it its just sold as a package PM So I Yes but the end product So Maybe we should go with a two then because its not perfect because we cant do it initially but we Yeah ME Yeah but we yeah we dont have it so d In the end product UI But M Changing covers is also trend that we followed ID It does its not part of the basic product ID It that thats what I call trendy ID I mean the shape is trendy ID The the sh the the functions are trendy ID Its just the colours that are not supporting the basic model ME Now But its not a one ID Because you ha its just not affordable at the moment ME Yeah ME Oh UI Mmhmm ID Its possible but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour ME Oh well Oops ME Oh its a two right UI Mmhmm ME On the last one ME Uh that n thats all PM Overall score ID Overall score ME Overall ME Its um ten sixteen three uh two two point seven or something like that ID One two three ID sixteen ID Two two point some two point something UI Hmm ME I dont know why PM Ten sixteen divided by Is two two third UI Six ME Six ID Two and two thirds ME Um So we can say its its the product is its okay ID Its okay but thats yo m mostly its its influenced by the fact that we didnt have enough resources to implement speech recognition ME Y not Yeah UI Mmhmm PM Theres Yeah if we make it into a four as in neutral because we didnt implement it so we cant say that we that its really not well implemented UI Mmhmm ID Cause yeah that gives you a seven which ruins your your average ID Without that it would be like under it wouldnt yeah it would be under two ID So I think we have even with this its reasonable ME Woah ME Yeah PM We come out on a average of two one eighth ID Well I think its two is okay PM So which is pretty w good UI Mmhmm ID Yeah two is pretty good PM Its at least on the positive side PM So We could definitely have done better if weve had more resources but Yeah UI Hmm of course ID Definitely ME Yeah ID Yeah I think its probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didnt sp didnt talk talk enough about the possibility of the LCD display UI Mmhmm ME Yeah ID We could have used it more efficiently we just didnt think of it that way ME Yeah ME Yeah with PM True ID So like I said changing channels everything hidden in your LCD display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything ME The scale UI But I think for this price this is its really a reasonable product ID I think we div I think we did very well uh ev even if you look at this score we did quite well UI Its a good product ME Yeah ME With an LCD screen UI Oh ID It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved UI Oh UI Yeah ID So UI But if pep people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pu to pay more because its cannot be done for this ME Yeah you can make em another one ID They sh they should get kids and just stick em in TV and say change the channel UI Hmm yeah UI Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that ID I don think so UI You cannot th think of that No its not ID Uh its just not it its not affordable ID Or your sh you should lose the LCD screen probably but I think thats I think the LCD screen is more worth than speech recognition UI Mmhmm UI Oh Its also more attractive ID Definitely ID Okay that was that ME Yeah ME Yeah ID So thats the final product without the speakers I guess PM So did you Yeah ID Lets see what was left in the the Another one ID Hmm ID Yeah we evaluate the product ID General project whats i in For example I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created ID We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which I thought was pretty creative because it was never never ever listed somewhere UI Hmm ME Favourite channel ID Well Anyways ID Yeah leadership is up to you ID I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it ID But thats not for me to decide ME Yeah I know ID I think we did pretty well as teamwork though ME Yeah ID Because yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results initially of course I wanted to contact you UI Yes UI Hmm UI Hmm ME Yeah youre working separate UI Yeah ID Say look this is youre doing the wrong thing youre s youre wasting your time now because were implementing stuff that we cannot afford ME Yeah UI Huh ME Yeah yeah yeah UI Hmm ID So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because thats thats what would w you what you would normally do either call or email someone UI Hmm ME Yeah yeah yeah ME Direct uh communication with yeah PM And we could share information which we received ID So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways UI Hmm UI Thats the same thing that I had in the beginning UI Everybody was using materials that s I didnt have UI So Oh ID It didnt have or didnt knew what they costs or whatever ME Yeah ID There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them PM Yeah UI Hmm ID So that was a little unclear I suppose ID I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool ID I think uh s especially for design issues its very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little its easier to share them ME My handwriting is little bit yeah ME Yeah UI Hmm PM Although for actual design Id say the response time should be a little bit higher because The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that ID Its a little less it the response time is le its very bad UI Hmm ID Its good to visualise everything but I think the response time should could be a lot better ME But th thats Yeah okay ID Definitely UI Mmhmm ID Yeah its true PM So Oh can you UI But theres uh also one problem with this I noticed UI Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n Oh ID No you dont have to ME No ID No you dont ID I jin I didnt check the finish button ME You can Done and then its okay ID I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever UI Okay I saw that uh Hmm ID Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done ID Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically ID But its not necessary to check either one of those two ID You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme UI Yeah but I made Okay but I made three pages and they were not finished ME Oh okay ME Okay yeah UI And when the third one was finished I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further ID Okay before starting a ne a new page ME Okay ID Okay that could be b UI Exactly UI So we cannot work on more than one page at same time ME Oh UI Thats not possible ME Hmm UI You have to finish it completely then download it its then start a new one ID Okay PM Okay ID Yeah okay UI Thats not very uh handy but if you know that then its not a problem ID Thats Yeah its understandable okay ID Any new ideas ID Yeah more communication between between uh thats the thing I noticed that communication is very um very important because if you get new information its essential f for the other teammates to know that as soon as possible because you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side ME Important to mm Yeah ID So I think that could have been better ID But thats I think its more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else UI Hmm ID So Yeah I think so PM Yeah well it could also possibly be well is it a more realtime information base so we can all see which information is available to one another ID And l less p less spam probably ID Im not sure i Im not sure you got spammed as well but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something UI Mmhmm UI Ah UI Well Hmm ID So which were totally useless actually ID I thought I should probably look into them but they were all useless ID So I just Oh okay PM Well I personally did not have that but Thats probably your l description ME Mm Yeah after After five minutes uh Yeah PM But I also didnt not really PM But still you had that as well UI Huh PM Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information UI Yeah UI Yeah Mm PM There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay ID I didnt have any uh more information its just always the same here ID So thats thats kind of a It would change but not for me ME Email uh its Yeah ID So Id I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually UI Hmm UI Hmm ID I couldnt do any research myself or I see thats yeah w I could have done a little extra work probably then But I was busy enough anyway UI Hmm ID So Any new ideas found UI Hmm ID Or is that a cause uh yeah its well probably is UI No PM How much time do we have for this anyway ID I have no clue ID Thats like ohbut it Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget we should celebrate ID So Uh okay think thats about it UI Okay bring out the beer PM Yeah PM Champagne ME I want one for my own ID Uh Im not sure what we should still do though uh t lets see what all your tasks were finished right ME Yeah ID What you ha from your assistant UI I have no more email ID So lets Okay I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up UI My coach is uh being very silent now ME Yeah my personal coach i What Yeah name ID I think we took very little time now because Yeah were in agreement everything the design is okay ID The one thing we missed though we dont have a product name UI No we havent think above about that ID How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name PM Product name UI Huh UI Its better than thi I think than a serial number UI Sony uh TR something uh f means nothing to me ME Or fruit name ID Just oh think of a catchy name UI Uh Like fruit names ID Ill be working on this until the beep until it beeps ID So What ME Fruit name or something like that ME The banana remote or something ID Fruit ID You dont want it to resemble a banana ME I dont know ME Yeah its the form of it PM The bana cause its not yellow anymore ID Its not yellow anyway ME Yeah oh yeah ID Its not yellow anymore ID It is curved but No its Hmm ME Uh yeah PM Well uh I was going for the RC deluxe but its not really a catchy name or anything its more Something with our company name can we do anything with that ME Uh Yeah UI Uh at least its not something with numbers UI Numbers are so meaningless to the people UI I mean ME Thats true ME Reaction Real Reaction PM Maybe theres something on the website which will help us out UI Real Reaction PM The reaction deluxe ID Real Reaction future RC ID Step into the future of of remote controlling your TV PM Is that a name or a c campaign ID No thats a thats a catchy slogan PM Yeah PM Or the The real reactor ID Control your remote control UI Real react ID I go for future RC probably ID Something like Its short f Real reactor UI The Real Reactor I dont find that uh that bad at all UI Yeah PM You should write it down as a an option UI Because our name is Real Reaction ID Uh that thats That makes me think of different products than a remote control really ID Im not sure ID Real reaction in a real Real reactor ME Zapping ME The Yeah sure PM So thats one option ID Didnt notice UI Im looking for things in the name ID Mm UI So that the first three letters are s the same PM Should I write the banana down or Sure UI REA REA ID I take f yeah take a banana ME The banana ID Hmm ME Remote ME Banana recei RC UI The triple R UI Real Reaction remotes control ME Remote PM Well I Uh do you mean it like You mean it like this UI Triple R ME R three C ME R three C UI yeah UI Yeah that ME Real Reaction Remote Control ME R three C ME Oh yeah ID No not like that ID It should be it should be longer because its not a product name that you f print on a box UI I think triple R UI Doesnt sound ID Just write out triple like a word triple RC triple stripe Oh ME Yeah triple R UI Yeah ID Triple dash R dash s s C ME Triple RC UI Ah ME The triple RC yeah ID Yeah ME R s R three C ID R dash C PM Dash C UI I think I like it like this more ID Dash ID Triple R or triple RC PM Like a C right now or a dash in a C ME Triple R dash ID How about do both ID Sure if it looks stupid ID Uh I think that the the RC together takes away the the the image of its a triple Uh the first the first one looks like its a triple remote control but its only a single remote control UI Hmm UI Mm ME That Yeah this yeah ID And its especially on the triple R thats important UI I would huh ID The Real Reaction Remote UI I would lose the C and just name it triple R PM Is it triple RCs PM No UI It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it ME Triple remote UI I would just say triple Rs triple R Thats also short catchy ME Yeah ID Yeah triple R yeah you can Yeah triple R PM Well thats another option ME Its okay PM Okay so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ME The

one to go home UI So See you in a minute ID Probably ID See ID Okay goodbye ME Damn ME I will write that one in a Word uh document UI Okay ID Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report PM Yeah sure UI Cant we take this one ME Oh sh Um Yeah okay I will ask you when uh I need the information UI Otherwise we have to do it all over again PM I dont really know whether we can save it as a picture or no UI Is it okay if I try UI Is that okay with you PM Sure UI Ill put it back in a minute ME So its oh UI Okay it has been saving something but where to I

Oh yeah UI Okay ME Can I see scores ME Uh one one two threes two Okay then well overall two points UI Oh of course UI Sorry ME Yes PM I see you later ME Yeah ME Mm,"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK. It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. The latter was taken out, along with the special colour. Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R."
